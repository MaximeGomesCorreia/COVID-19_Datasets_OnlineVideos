<COMMENT 5> My sister in law and brother tested positive for COVID-19.. She had no fever but lost her taste of smell and taste and then developed a dry cough still no fever and his symptom was just loss of smell and taste for a short period like one day and that was it. There are many symptoms that you could have and I’m pretty sure all it takes is having one symptom from the cdc website to get tested. GET TESTED!!! </COMMENT 5>

<COMMENT 19> I've just had a cough and no other symptoms have apeared and I've been checking for 5 days now since the cough started </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> I've been sneezing for almost three days now but I don't have runny nose,dry throat, just sneezing and feel like about to vomit a little. Maybe it's because of the sudden weather changes 🤷‍♂️ </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 2> Everywhere you look on the internet you see WORK being offered ads posted by FEMA.

So, the US Government knows this situation is going to get much worse (FEMA job offerings) because they are the one's in charge of the situation.

These FEMA death camps were build 15 years ago so, what does that tell you.

The COVID19 throat swabs tainted with the virus ?

Will the vaccination shots give people the virus like the "flu shot" gives the elderly the flu ?

Government officials in other states are telling their citizens that there are dangers insects in the area and aircraft will be conducting an Ariel Spraying CAMPAIGN over their neighborhoods at sunset when people are at home.

People in the food processing industry are mysteriously becoming sick with COVID19 therefore, food shortages can arise.

The US Government is buying up all face masks and gloves then hiding them is warehouses in order to keep them out of the hands of needy citizens.

Secrecy behind the global 5G surveillance program and the widespectuum RF Radiation that is dangerous to people's health.

People and their families living on special Military bases since last year are restricted from television, raido, internet and all outside comuniciations with the outside world and these military personal are flying these high ALTITUDE aircraft that are spraying a mystery fluid into the air whereas these elongated offwhite clouds are seen everywhere.  

People in the News Media are observed smiling and with grinds on their faces when discussing the deadly global Pandemic.

No one person in the upper most portion of the US Government has ever been seen wearing a mask. Have they received a vaccination shot prior to the Pandemic ? </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> If all of these corona virus’ are coming from bats, then why is it that the ladies that rehabilitate bats in Australia for years, ( being scratched and bitten by them many times) are not getting these sicknesses and dropping dead in masses? </COMMENT 3>

<COMMENT 5> Hello, sir.

Let me introduce myself, I'm Ferry, from Bogor, Indonesia.

Just sharing info. That in Indonesia, our small team, named Milagros, has given milagros water donations to hospitals that treat positive patients.

And the result, just by drinking Milagros water, recovery from covid19, is very perfect.

In our data, it has been noted that Milagros water is able to fight covid19. Also other health problems.

What I'm focusing on is that in Indonesia there is no need for a vaccine. We just take Milagros, corona can be overcome.

Right now, what your country does not have, but in my country is very abundant, is Milagros water.

Which is clearly proven to be able to cure positive patients covid19 to completion.

And it's proven, some of our small teams don't need an anti-covid vaccine. Just drinking milagros, it's resolved.

If you want to know more about Milagros water, you can contact my Whatsapp number at +6285925081694 </COMMENT 5>

<COMMENT 17> I pick my nose everyday and I’m absolutely fine 😂 we need germs everyday to fight other germs . Sanitizing and going mental on this would make you way worse because our body needs germs . Certain germs are amazing . For those of you idiots that have pets. Do you watch your cat or your dog drink out of your toilet? And then you’re kissing your pet and making love to your pet? Yeah you’re kissing the damn toilet bowl. It’s pretty funny 😆 </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> It’s an infectious disease caused by the government no shit. All you morons wearing a mask you’re just suffocating yourself and making your lungs worse and making your lungs work three times more than what they’re supposed to. When I see an idiot driving in their car by themselves with a mask it’s an idiot. when I see an idiot running or jogging outside or walking or riding their bike it’s an idiot. when I see an idiot simply sitting on a bench outside in fresh air that’s a damn idiot. The bottom line is you all are idiots 🤔 </COMMENT 18>

<COMMENT 4> How much is that Vitamin C & D. Dr.Mike </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Thank you...Folks, re-read the video's title ...The answer is, YES, take your vitamins ( C and D) and minerals(Zinc and magnesium) and eat your antioxidants ASAP... Do not wait for Vaccines....Mandatory, forced vaccines...Line up...Wait, Don’t be me. I am an M.D. but let me tell you what you do not know about vaccines and what I didn’t know and what 90% of all M.D.'s do not know and what No politician knows... I did not know that Vaccines had not been tested against any placebo (ever). I did not know that animal testing would be skipped for the future COVID vaccines..I did not know the 30+ ingredients used in vaccines. I did not know that there are neurotoxic aluminum and mercury molecules in vaccines. I did not know enough to research vaccines before vaccinating my own children. 
I did not know that my own precocious, active, talking son would be vaccine-injured. 
I did not know that my own baby brother (also an M.D.) would become paralyzed (Guillain-Barre) and then die after his swine flu vaccine in the same hospital (Shands) where he had received his medical training. 
I did not know that my mother(an R.N.) would get 8 vaccines in 1 day to "catch-up" with newly added CDC vaccines to keep her job as Head Nurse in the Largest Hospital in the county and then get such severe, aggressive, progressive brain fog in days and become unable to dial a phone or push an elevator button or remember any of her  5 children in a few weeks and then have this "dementia" progress and then die in diapers
I did not know that vaccines were given a blanket indemnity from liability in 1986 and now total immunity for all COVID vaccines for the future. I did not know that we gave more vaccines than any other country starting on day #1...I did not know that we have the highest rate of SIDS of the top 35 industrialized countries... I did not know that we had more autism than any other country... I did not know that Vaccines could injure an infant's brain. 
I did not know that vaccines can result in autoimmunity and neurological damage. I did not know that herd immunity does not apply to vaccines and is a myth created by the CDC. I did not know that Vaccines have almost no effect after about four years. 
I did not know how emotional the topic would be and how angry people would be at me for just asking questions about Vaccine Safety. I did not know that pediatricians were paid to give vaccines. I did not know that the CDC owned the Patents on so many vaccines. 
I did not know that the NIH stands to make Billions of dollars on a COVID vaccine. 
I did not know how angry at myself I would be for not knowing. I did not know that the CDC committed fraud and destroyed their evidence in their vaccine safety studies when it showed vaccines can cause autistic neurological changes..I did not know that a whistleblower came forward with all the evidence but he was silenced. I did not know that Merck committed fraud in their vaccine research repeatedly. I did not know that aluminum molecules in the vaccine ingredients is connected to brain inflammation and brain inflammation has been proven to be connected to autism. 
I did not know that vaccines contained human cells from aborted fetuses..
I did not know how much mainstream media would censor the independent research that showed these facts...I did not know that 90% of all vaccine research that the CDC and FDA use to "approve" vaccines are done by the scientists hired by vaccine makers..I did not know if we were alone... I did not know how many other millions of parents and families in the world have been affected by vaccine reactions..
I did not know how many would find, join, and share the Facebook help group= Vaccine Support Group on Facebook..I did not know that FB would delete the scientific medical research that had been suppressed, deleted, or censored until it happened to us...  Dr.MAS.. </COMMENT 5>

<COMMENT 10> Can  we take vitamin c </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> I’d like to know the benefits of dandelion for the body, please. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> I’m a true believer in Echinacea as you say certain brands are better than others. I take Vitamins C, D, Zinc and Folic acid. I take Echinacea if I feel a cold coming on. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Thank you for the valuable Info </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Is it ok to drink Orange or Lemon juice or do we need to eat the whole fruit to get vitamin C? </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> They are pulling your videos. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Wow. Just saw that your video on Covid 19 and Vitamin D was removed. I hadn’t seen the whole thing yet and I’m disappointed. Is there any other way to see it perhaps? Thanks for your videos and information. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> no question about taking those particular vitamins....virus not not.  Immune system can always use that extra support.  Those gummy vitamins that have all the vitamins are rather tasty. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Every person has a unique health system. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Andbdy ans in hindi in short fom...whts can he say </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> As re: Vitamin C & it's ability to treat a cold, I can testify it worked for me when my source was a quart of orange juice.  Happened in 1980 while driving from Louisiana to Iowa.  I'd been on the road a few days eating fast food and had a runny nose and was sneezing.  Stopped at a roadside convenience store for a soda.  Disgusted by the fact that the soda was the better part of the cost of a quart of OJ, I bought and downed the OJ quickly (about 20 min).  By the time I got to the bottom of the carton, my nose was dry, my sniffles stopped and I was a convert.  Maybe I'm an outlier, or maybe the studies only showed the supplements tested did not work as expected. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 2> Congrats on getting all of your videos back on YouTube! </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Sad how people are still so deathly terrified of and obsessed with a virus with an IFR of 0.26% or less. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> I think we should eliminate the current education system... and start teaching every person science and medicine because that’s important information... and what schools now teach is mostly useless. They now spend years repeating the same useless things, like force kids to read books and give book reports, etc. Once a person learns to read , which for most people would take literally 1-2  months, they should start learning whatever things people already in those fields know what is most important. Right? </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Good job MedCram community for pushing back on Youtube and Google! Finding this out gave me goosebumps! Great news folks! </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Why don't you speak about this study: *Influenza vaccination and respiratory virus interference among
Department of Defense personnel during the 2017–2018 influenza season by Greg G. Wolff?* </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> No mention of Ivermectin this time?? I`ve been booted off Facebook three times now for suspicious behaviour for posting about it. Didn`t even try to get back on this time but I also mentioned it to BBC researchers on a radio station several times and it was never mentioned there either. Does it scare big pharma that much? </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Mexicali and Tijuana are both bordering US. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Great video! If thrombosis is a consequence of ACE2 receptors being disabled we might also see it with SARS1 (since that binds to ACE2) but not with MERS, and not with influenza viruses. I don't think we do see it with influenza or everyone wouldn't be saying it was unusual and a new thing with COVID-19.

 I found this SARS1 autopsy: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12781536/. Patient 3 had "Epithelial denudation with fibrin thrombi present in pulmonary vessels". Might be a coincidence.

I think some people are speculating that SARS2 is actually infecting endothelial cells. But if that were the case wouldn;t autopsies find viral RNA in other parts of the body? I don't think any have. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> So glad that YouTube got sensible about MedCram videos. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> I have read studies on the affect of N-acetyl cysteine in relationship to pulmonary hypertension. The studies have contradicted themselves, with some showing (in rats) that it increases PH, while in others it is suggested that NAC may be a treatment for PH.

I am currently supplementing with NAC and have hypertension. I started on this supplementation after viewing your videos on COVID 19. 

Could you please clarify this NAC PH connection? Perhaps you can address this in one of your videos. 

Thank you very much. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> I thought the Coronavirus can withstand hear up to 197 degrees? </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Kindly check the Fabunan Antiviral Injection in the Philippines particulary the ingredients thank you </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> There hasn't been a corona virus that caused a pandemic since the Spanish flu you idiot. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Shame on Google, You Tube and Twitter for their unlawful censorship.  Hope AG Barr uses MedCram example in coming policy changes and Anti-trust actions. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Lol </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Strategic Culture report: The report focuses on the “manifold and heavy consequences of the Corona measures” and warns that these are “grave”.
More people are dying because of state-imposed Corona-measures than they are being killed by the virus.
The reason is a scandal in the making:
A Corona-focused German healthcare system is postponing life-saving surgery and delaying or reducing treatment for non-Corona patients. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> A reproach could go along these lines: During the Corona crisis the State has proved itself as one of the biggest producers of Fake News. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> The danger is obviously no greater than that of many other viruses. There is no evidence that this was more than a false alarm. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> fakedemic  Worldwide, within a quarter of a year, there has been no more than 250,000 deaths from Covid-19, compared to 1.5 million deaths [25,100 in Germany] during the influenza wave 2017/18. </COMMENT 20>

He passed with us in the room I had to take care of him. And my mask broke... Cause his nurse wasnt there... Two days later I start having a weird cough. And assumed I'm developing allergies. Then I got real dizzy and stayed in bed for 3 days. By the 3rd day, I agreed to go to the ER, They tested me for Covid cause being in the nursing home.  And I tested positive,  I can't hold food down, I vomit every time I eat. I didnt even kno vomiting could be a sign. </COMMENT 11>

https://youtu.be/LmerhQaIuew </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Even with the Tories' desperately fiddled figures, UK has officially 2nd most deaths in the world, behind Trumpland. Only 6 other countries have even 1/4 the number of deaths. Setting aside San Marino and Andorra, both tiny enclaves in Covid hotspots, UK is 2nd behind Belgium for deaths per million. Little wonder the Tories don't show the international graphs- and the media cover up for them. Catastrophic handling of the crisis by blustering buffoon Boris, his Dominatrix Cummings and Goings and their cronies, and yet he is proud of what they have done! Failure with herd immunity policy, care homes (didn't even bother to count the deaths for a month), PPE, testing (too late, missed targets and had to fiddle the figures) and tracing. Now they'll be making face coverings compulsory on public transport after saying face masks were counterproductive, and they are to quarantine foreigners, despite having already allowed thousands in for football matches from raging Covid hotspots.

<COMMENT 12> The Washington Times: "The response to the coronavirus is hyped.   And in time this hype will be revealed as politically hoaxed.   In fact, COVID-19 will go down as one of the world's biggest, most shameful overblown, overhyped, overly and irrationally inflated and outright deceptively flawed responses to a health matter in American history, one that was carried largely on the lips of medical professionals who have no business running a national economy or government." </COMMENT 12>

<COMMENT 9> THIS JUST BEGINS Personally, I realize that what is happening is only the beginning, but? It will be? Given that as humans we are destined to die but I don't know you I believe in God and maybe you should do the same but therefore we live and move on According to me from my point of view what is happening is only a small part of the beginning and I do not care if someone read this For my part, I say we still have a chance to make the change THE LIBERTY EXPRESSION. At another point others would say: PONTE Ah STUDY CHILD !!! : STOP SAYING MOM $ ¿# @% I care a% € & $ = # @ what you say . And lose because I know the way of acting of others but let me tell you something if we can't make the change ourselves at least let's encourage more people who are not too late yet SANTIAGO 2: 26 Because the body without spirit is dead to faith without debris is dead. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> I think sneezing coughing into elbow is silly  as if sneeze and not fast enough you will have bad stuff on elbow  the same elbow your meant to shake hands with?
Why do waiting in queues.  Isnt this more dangerous as in a queue wind is flying down possibly every person there? I am confused with these rules. Also spiders can go up into sky for miles? Sand from Sahara to uk after storm. Isnt flem going to float possibly miles not just dozen in a line but real spread. Finally sending yougest kids back to school? This would be last group to go back to school. This has many contradictions and many strange ways to stay uninfected? </COMMENT 10>

<COMMENT 12> Discovering viruses inside the body is like discovering sugar, salt, calcium, lipid in the blood or discovering sperms or ovum inside the reproductive organs or even discovering that we have a heart that beats. It is just stating the obvious. Fact is that we are a storehouse of millions of germs including viruses, bacteria that have been living inside our bodies from birth to death but do not cause any infection. Infection is caused only when our immunity power becomes weak and then too our bodies fight it out by itself thus making our bodies stronger than before. So please stop listening to the Pro $$$ titute media that has been paid a hefty package running to millions to spread this scaredemic called corona. Remember its the media that has played the satans role of spreading corona fear from the days of wuhan in december until the present and this has to be taken care of or else it will continue to ruin our lives. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Instead of fighting off the Coronavirus can’t we just make a medicine to boost our immune system? If we have a strong immune system the Coronavirus will go away eventually? I’m not sure </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Guys there is no reason to be racist he is trying to help us do just stop </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Thank you very much </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> wait 
if covid 19 dies from high temperature 
why it doesn't die in the human body?
the human's body temperature is 37 
and the covid 19 dies at 35 temperature </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Thanks for the video, was so helpful for me! I have already liked+subscribed. :) </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> It's going to infect 60% or 70% or more people in the population </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> If your troubled in understanding. 

Do you see your electical fan or airconditioner 

See they have two sides the one that takes the air and the propeller that fans the air 


If dust goes inside it it becomes dirty. If you don't clean it the dust grows because the air it takes contain dust SO THE dust grows bigger 


Until it covers the whole fan 


The air that will come out will be less because its covered with dust 


But not just the air becomes less the air that will also be taken out will also contain dust until the airconditioner or the fan breaks down due to the heat that will be trapped inside the mechanism and then the mechanism will die due to overwork 

An because of that the dust will cover the whole room and will eventually grow into dust bunnies and become more dirtier

That's how covid 19 works </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 1> Says COVID-18 instead of 19 😂 </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Even with the Tories' desperately fiddled figures (far below the reality), UK has officially 2nd most Covid deaths in the world, behind Trumpland. Only 6 other countries have even 1/4 the number of deaths. Setting aside San Marino and Andorra, both tiny enclaves in Covid hotspots, UK is 2nd behind Belgium for deaths per million. Little wonder the Tories don't show the international graphs- and the media cover up for them. Catastrophic handling of the crisis by blustering buffoon Boris, his Dominatrix Cummings and Goings and their cronies, and yet he is proud of what they have done! Failure with herd immunity policy, care homes (didn't even bother to count the deaths for a month), PPE, testing (too late, missed targets and had to fiddle the figures) and tracing. Now they'll be making face coverings compulsory on public transport after saying face masks were counterproductive, and they are to quarantine foreigners, despite having already allowed thousands in for football matches from raging Covid hotspots. Oh, and Cheltenham races was another breeding ground they were warned against. They should be hung, drawn and quartered </COMMENT 2>

Why did thousands of tests from the UK have to go to the US and why do they need to be redone ?

<COMMENT 15> I think it to early to lift the lock down what about the infection </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> There needs to be an investigation into how the NHS has played a role into deaths in care homes by sending elderly patients with covid19 back into care homes. </COMMENT 16>

<COMMENT 18> If the reports are correct, and Matt Hancock did not release vital information from pandemic modelling a few years ago, which lead to countless deaths due to not being prepared, he needs to be in jail! </COMMENT 18>

<COMMENT 10> Fauci is fraud . </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Dr. Fauci works for bill gates </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Wake-up, people. The planet and our country have been shut down by hysteria and fear. Masks, social distancing, and contact-tracing are all SNAKE OILS being sold to us. Don't buy into it. It is silly to be walking around wearing a mask and praying for a vaccine when we already have a cure. HCQ and CDS (MMS). HCQ is cheap, effective and has been in use for 70+ years. Big pharma and the medical mafia can't make a dime on it so it must be shown to be "scary" so they can push the new expensive, patented, and exclusive drug and vaccines that will certainly have more risks. People, look at the fine print on all of the medications you take right now before you talk about the risks of taking HCQ as a preventative or cure. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> I want you to know that you are amazing and you are so loved. Whether you know it or not it is true that you have a Father in heaven who loves you so much, that He gave His only son to take your place on the cross so that you might know Jesus Christ and believe in Him so that you may have everlasting life.(John 3:16) If you are still reading this, I want you to know that Jesus is the answer to that emptiness that you have been feeling and it is true that Jesus wants a personal relationship with you. If you admit you are a sinner (WE ALL SIN!), Believe that Jesus Christ died on the cross to pay the debt for all your sins, was buried and on the third day, God rose Him from the dead. YOU ARE SAVED! "If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved." (Romans 10:9) P.S. JESUS IS COMING BACK! </COMMENT 13>

Then I got real dizzy and stayed in bed for 3 days. By the 3rd day, I agreed to go to the ER, They tested me for Covid cause being in the nursing home.  And I tested positive,  I can't hold food down, I vomit every time I eat. I didnt even kno vomiting could be a sign. </COMMENT 11>

Why don't we just stay home for we have the flue, the swine flue, the chickenpox, measles and alike viruses so we can help the rich people make financial, political, health, social, and other systems collapse then we forget their blame on global failure and start from scratch...

From Doctor Strange,
This is only my point of view, might be
correct, may be wrong, I do not know.
I still say again and again that Stupid
Things, NEVER EXISTED at all in real
Life, but the question mark, how it became
existed? It became existed because so
many human believed its existed but
no doubt, in the first place its NEVER
Existed at any course, at any Time, at 
any Country. Because as we all know
when we talk about The Real Virus and
I am not talking about that Stupid Thing
that NEVER existed, easy to say, example,
when 3 people ate 1 food that consisted
of disease, so only 3 people got infected
not others, right. 
please look out my comments in FB:
https://www.facebook.com/sydmohd.so/
So,.... Long Story To cut short, How To ensure 
That Stupid Thing To disappeared by itself
BY Disbelieve that stupid Thing, in other words
distancing our self from that stupid things
 so most probably it will Vanished from Human Life
Forever, all in Human Head....could try out.
Simply The Best Word, If You believed a good
thing, You will get Good Thing, Then and
forever...........By Doctor Strange..
*** End Of The Day, How GOOD and Bad
         Our Head/Thinking Really Is*******

Please Take This Jokes, If I`m in charge Of 
Doctors PHD To Pass The High Scholarship
Degree, I will definitely Put Up One Best Paper
That is SOUL CHEMISTRY Degree before all
The Doctors Could Hold A Doctor PHD Degree.

Some of the Questions Are;
1)   How To Understandable Human Soul?
2)   Is It useful To more understanding of
      Human/Patients reactions as and when
      given The Medicine, Vaccine or Diagnoses?
3)  Do Doctors need To Know The Differences
     between Human Soul and Body? </COMMENT 16>

<COMMENT 12> This pandemic is a huge farce I repeat this pandemic is a huge farce fact 1 as humans our immune system becomes stronger against viruses and sickness if we have contracted the virus 2 this so called virus has been blown out of proportion to the point that every one hides behind a mask WHICH WILL NOT PROTECT YOU FROM THE GOD DAMN DISEASE if you are stupid enough to believe that a mask will prevent you from contracting the disease your dumb AS FUCK this whole pandemic is a way to lower our immune systems so that way either when the next more deadly disease will kill so many more people that the world population will drop astronomically  or so that the social elite can make more money off a new mandatory vaccine because us humans finally got it through our thick fucking skulls that the flu mutates every year and the vaccine that they give you is for the previous years strand of flu so it is up to us humans to make the decision to either be with the 99% of people who believe this and are following the media like mindless sheeple or the 1% like me who are smart enough to realize that this whole thing is completely made up and we have no reason to worry about this so called pandemic and to all the people who will reply with things like “actually we should be very worried cause we’re a bunch of mindless fucking sheeple who HAVE NO IDEA HOW EVOLUTION WORKS AND WERE TO RETARDED TO FOGURE IT OUT WITHOUT OUR MOMMIES HOLDING OUR HANDS ALL THE THROUGH THIS BUT OH WAIT WERE NOT ALOUD TO BE WITHIN 6 FEET OF EACH OTHER

<COMMENT 15> The new coronavirus pneumonia is the influenza of unknown cause of death in the United States.

Asahi TV reported that as early as February 7, the United States CDC stated that "The symptoms of new coronavirus pneumonia and influenza are very similar." Some symptoms of new coronavirus pneumonia and influenza are the same, e.g., fever, cough, runny nose and shortness of breath. So, the United
States does not test these influenzae of unknown cause of death, and only generalize them as the influenza of unknown cause of death.

China has successfully tested these U.S. influenzae of unknown cause of death that are caused by the new coronavirus. Now these U.S. influenzae of unknown cause of death is called as new-coronavirus pneumonia. But unfortunately, China's successful test has not been appreciated by all countries of the world, but has been accused by all countries of the world under the leadership of the United States. If China adopts the U.S. approach, i.e., does not test influenza of unknown cause of death, and only generalize as the influenza of unknown cause of death, China will not become the source of the new coronavirus. </COMMENT 15>

<COMMENT 10> Fauci is fraud . </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Dr. Fauci works for bill gates </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Wake-up, people. The planet and our country have been shut down by hysteria and fear. Masks, social distancing, and contact-tracing are all SNAKE OILS being sold to us. Don't buy into it. It is silly to be walking around wearing a mask and praying for a vaccine when we already have a cure. HCQ and CDS (MMS). HCQ is cheap, effective and has been in use for 70+ years. Big pharma and the medical mafia can't make a dime on it so it must be shown to be "scary" so they can push the new expensive, patented, and exclusive drug and vaccines that will certainly have more risks. People, look at the fine print on all of the medications you take right now before you talk about the risks of taking HCQ as a preventative or cure. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> I want you to know that you are amazing and you are so loved. Whether you know it or not it is true that you have a Father in heaven who loves you so much, that He gave His only son to take your place on the cross so that you might know Jesus Christ and believe in Him so that you may have everlasting life.(John 3:16) If you are still reading this, I want you to know that Jesus is the answer to that emptiness that you have been feeling and it is true that Jesus wants a personal relationship with you. If you admit you are a sinner (WE ALL SIN!), Believe that Jesus Christ died on the cross to pay the debt for all your sins, was buried and on the third day, God rose Him from the dead. YOU ARE SAVED! "If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved." (Romans 10:9) P.S. JESUS IS COMING BACK! </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> I hope this encourages everyone in this difficult time 🙏

<COMMENT 3> Covid has never been a worry for me nor has the more deadly common flu. I certainly wong be sticking any "vaccine" in me either.. leave that for the weak and scared, which seems like half the population lol.. pussies </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> And again the MSM including CNBComedy, The Lancent (leftist pseudo research), Harvard, WHO, Universities and so called 'Researchers' lying about Hydroxychloroquin and Trump is correct, IT WORKS ! : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llZ1uurWLmA </COMMENT 4>

<COMMENT 6> HORRIBLE MEDICAL SYSTEM IN USA.  POOR DIE RICH LIVES.    NO MEDICAL INSURANCE DEATH SENTENCE IN USA. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> From 3:33 onwards i think it is quite conclusive how much more protection we can get ourselves and give others if everyone wear a mask. WHO has to acknowledge that and be flexible. Surgical masks are always at risk of shortage in supply, but cotton and washable ones i beg to differ - they can easily be handmade. WHO the guy at the helm needs a dose of logic jab. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> I hope this encourages everyone in this difficult time 🙏

<COMMENT 12> The laser scattering detection of droplets does not prove that mask wearing reduces infection.  How long do the imaged droplets linger in the air?   How far do they travel?  Could droplets smaller than those that can be imaged pass through the mask?  Did the speaker emit a cloud of droplets in the vicinity of his face that lingered in the air?  What is the potential viral load on a droplet?  How many droplets would a person have to breathe to become infected? </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> What I’d like to know is how necessary is a mask when walking around outside.  For example, if I’m walking to Trader Joe’s in NYC a mile away, is the mask necessary while walking outside?  Reasonable # of people out, not crowded.  Quickly walking by.  Can someone actually quantify the risk?  Because when the weather gets hot and humid here, wearing a mask will become problematic.  It already contributes to a certain breathlessness and headache.  To me, the risk of infection seems quite low. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> The pandemic is a fraud to establish global control, David Icke https://www.bitchute.com/channel/weBLW8e6mgIB/ Alex Jones https://banned.video/channel/the-alex-jones-show 20 interviews with experts, 1 interview involves 150 doctors https://freedomplatform.londonreal.tv/ </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Great video as always.  The visualizing droplets video was really interesting.  The mask used was actually "a slightly damp washcloth over the speakers mouth."  It would be interesting to see a test with dry and slightly damp cloth masks, along with the medical grade masks.  On a different note It seems to me that we should be pumping up primary care to work up patients early on to determine those who are at risk to progress to serious disease (elevated D-dimer, IL markers, etc.) as well as having the opportunity to start the potentially useful antivirals before the storm.  Thank you both for the tremendous service you are providing. </COMMENT 15>

<COMMENT 4> yes  we need to watch out </COMMENT 4>

<COMMENT 6> Sources? You make a lot of claims stating as facts - without a source.

<COMMENT 9> what is all the mathmatical words in this video? </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Two months later and it’s like A message in a fvckin bottle. Thank you for this invaluable information. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Yay we flatten the curb!
What do we do now?




We can go outside again </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Stay Clean Kids. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> There are many variables that make this presentation incomplete. This should be  compared and combined with other data and re-evaluated. For one, not a single "lilypad" is the same. Some are healthier than others. Second, lets not forget the impact of the environment we live in. The world is a big place, and some places are downright toxic for humans but a breeding ground for viruses, and vice versa: some places are good for humans to live in, but are deadly for viruses. There are just too many other aspects that, when taken into consideration, would deliver a more accurate presentation -- especially since we've learnt a lot more about the virus by now. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> So 'flattening the curve' means 'lengthening the curve'? </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Let’s not forget about the other ways people will suffer with this virus as some politicians keep people from working. Must be nice to be rich and not worry about such things. Perhaps shove sock people into nursing homes...yeah, that’ll help. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> 1.If we would have listened when they announced the corona virus it wouldn't have blown up inner face and less people would've died
2.they showed two different places one graph showing how much people got sick from going to the a parade in  Philadelphia  in 1918 when the worst influenza hit and there was over 200,000 people who attended and they lost 4,500 people but in St. Louis after two days detecting the first case they shut everything down the graph was lower then Philadelphia 
3.exponential  growth is scary but doesn't last forever </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> infection </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Almost 2 thousand people are dumb enough to understand the current issue we fight. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> First it was cancer now it’s covid-19..
Stay safe everyone. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> But there's one point you're missing: SARS 2 only affects elderly or chronically sick people, so I think governments should have quarantined and protected them beforehand and not let thousands of healthy adults get unemployed! </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 15> Awesome </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> As a purveyor and fan of lyric bastardizations AND an inveterate fan of Queen,  I was prepared for a cute/meh/ho-hum response. Instead I am ecstatic with admiration of every approximate rhyme and of the harmonies and the timing (song and action).. Spot on. Not just the song, but the message. Sorry I am coming so late to this. Amazing how fast things become dated in the Now Times. It was fast enough in the Before Times! In MY mind, it is easy enough to substitute a "wear a mask" message for the "wash your hands" lines. Even that is so Last Week. . Thanks for this! </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Absolutely fabulous!  Thanks for taking the time to create this, post this and entertain the %#&^$%@ out of me!! </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Fantastic video. But, as I watch the domestic terrorists commit arson and loot big screen TVs, there will be truth in 30 days. They'll be dead or masks and socialist distancing will be shown to be the non-cure to the non-disease.  NOTE TO ELDERLY TERRORISTS: If you are over 50 years old, you should wear a mask when you get that TV. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Amazing, fanny and very talented! Thank you! </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Wow!  so talented.  the singing, the lyrics, video!  Well done! </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 7> There are 2 proteolytic enzymes sold over the counter that may offer significant help to the clotting and the cytokine storme problem, nattokinase and serrapeptase.  Nattokinase is fibrinolytic and serrapeptase cuts chemical signals, cytokines, that produce inflammation etc.  RBY </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> This is exactly what the mainstrem media has been telling us just using more technical terms. All of these words mean they died of pneumonia and multisystem inflammation, causing blood clots. This is actually meant for healthcare professionals who can understand the medical terminology.

Thanks for ur medical videos..... 

But please make the videos more simple... And also tell do's n don't.. Could also pls make a list for symptoms of corona such as u get this or that....eg pneumonia is a symptom I. E. One of the byproduct of corona and this medicine takes care of pneumonia... 

Since I stay in India and we also take Ayurvedic medicine(it has no side effects since it's only herbs) at times  so for those  symptoms I can consult an aurvedic doctor and take a course of medicine... Hope that boosts my immunity... My psorasis attack got cured by Aurvedic doctor.... 

Pls make a list of all the symptoms of corona like (1) pneumonia, (2) patchy lungs etc... Than towards the rt column their symptoms and other information... Than followed by how an individual will feel if they get that... </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 2> Thank you for the well laid out explanation.  This must have taken a great deal of time to put together.  In addition, thanks for not talking down to us. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> It’s like some horror disease out of plague inc or a pandemic movie. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> And thanks for not talking down to us. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> im 5'7 and weight 210 lbs,  am I at risk? </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> After watching this video now I think there must be taken the biggest effort possible to get hold of an important biological vulnerability of that virus. We must seek for exacly such weaknesses in the viral DNA to prevent/stop it from multiplying. A genetical "switch" or "scissor" or "lockout" factor to freeze its multiplication. or to disrupt its DNA into pieces right in the place where it multiplies in our body. We must catch it right in the act, not late when all the damage already has been done to tissue, vessels, cells. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> 😘😘😘🥰🥰🥰 </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> When you said the word; Police! My anxiety increases 😨 </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> No where is these videos do you show a definitive study for virus. Did you actually look and find a virus? And document that?? </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> I've had C19 my wife says l'm heartless </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> This sounds like something that was engineered in a lab </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> U r very professional! </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> That’s what all viruses, I thought, do: make millions of copies of themselves. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Nah.. kan Obesitas ada </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> This thing can look like every illness out there and it can kill a lot of different ways.  Yes, that is very scary!  And for someone like me who has to travel for my job to support my family, and when I travel it is to visit clinics and hospitals, it has me pretty anxious!  This is the sort of thing that makes you realize how fragile we are as humans.  I don’t worry about myself as much as my family and those that I love.  I will do my best to stay safe, but I have to take care of my family by putting myself out there. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Aching joints? </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Seems like they're calling everything covid19. </COMMENT 17>

<COMMENT 2> Gulp </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> why are you not telling the truth about where the Covid -19 virus actually came from. It was not from an animal to human. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Kids are dying too. Get this updated quickly </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Like for corona warriors 👍👍👍 </COMMENT 5>

<COMMENT 8> Huh so you believed China ? That's cute </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Isaiah 43:1 “Don't fear, for I have redeemed you; I have called you by name; you are Mine.” God actually commands us not to fear, or worry. The phrase “fear not” is used at least 80 times in the Bible, most likely because He knows the enemy uses fear to decrease our hope and limit our victories. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> This video seems like Chinese propaganda </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Thanks to the nurses who gave their lives to cure strangers in need. 🙏🏼 </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Mutated. Covid 19 fatality rate > elderly. Quarantine, testing. 80% mild. ARDS: fluid build up. Cough/Sneeze spreads. Incubation period 5 days. Ro= how quickly it spreads. PR+PCR Test.

SARS CoV-2 causes COVID 19. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Warning! The moment you are reading this. There is a deadly virus that is killing millions! So help yourself by washing your hands when you’re going to eat. Also, bring some hand sanitizer when you go out so your hands stay clean. Stay safe, friend. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> I LOVE your citations at the end. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Study based on china mortality so some fact are wrong because china miss guiding with data </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Honestly, you can’t even get a break off of the news carrying on about COVID-19, I’m not saying that they shouldn’t but nobody actually gets it anyways most of the time. I can’t even cough or sneeze once without some imbecile thinking I have the "Coronavirus”. In my opinion everyone is kind of taking it a bit too serious. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Where's your proof that it went into a pangulen? Or are you being a parrot. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> It's sad that it took COVID-19 to bring us together. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> So somebody shagged a Pangolin after stuffing a dead Bat up it's arse and that's where this codswallop comes from,Thank fuck our government loves us. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Best Covid19 SarsCov2 awareness video..

Although people MUST wear face masks while going out.. Symptomatic or not..

Hats off for the tribute to Dr. Li in the end.

<COMMENT 10> Fauci is fraud . </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Dr. Fauci works for bill gates </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Wake-up, people. The planet and our country have been shut down by hysteria and fear. Masks, social distancing, and contact-tracing are all SNAKE OILS being sold to us. Don't buy into it. It is silly to be walking around wearing a mask and praying for a vaccine when we already have a cure. HCQ and CDS (MMS). HCQ is cheap, effective and has been in use for 70+ years. Big pharma and the medical mafia can't make a dime on it so it must be shown to be "scary" so they can push the new expensive, patented, and exclusive drug and vaccines that will certainly have more risks. People, look at the fine print on all of the medications you take right now before you talk about the risks of taking HCQ as a preventative or cure. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> I want you to know that you are amazing and you are so loved. Whether you know it or not it is true that you have a Father in heaven who loves you so much, that He gave His only son to take your place on the cross so that you might know Jesus Christ and believe in Him so that you may have everlasting life.(John 3:16) If you are still reading this, I want you to know that Jesus is the answer to that emptiness that you have been feeling and it is true that Jesus wants a personal relationship with you. If you admit you are a sinner (WE ALL SIN!), Believe that Jesus Christ died on the cross to pay the debt for all your sins, was buried and on the third day, God rose Him from the dead. YOU ARE SAVED! "If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved." (Romans 10:9) P.S. JESUS IS COMING BACK! </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> I hope this encourages everyone in this difficult time 🙏

<COMMENT 16> This is amazing! </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> How did the camera recordet all this? </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> И что именно главное, если верить увиденному: объекты вируса надо обезвреживать еще ДО проникновения в клетку (в межклеточном пространстве), чем тогда когда его протеиновая капсула находится уже в клетке и сама оболочка клетки будет для него прикрытием. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Я так понимаю, что коронавирус маскируется и "обманывает" имунную защиту человека на клеточном уровне. Значит нужно, чтобы вакцина "научила"  имунные клетки распознавать его еще до момента проникновения или же сама его распознавала и вместе с имунными клетками пыталась его уничтожать  еще до прямого контакта  с объектом проникновения. Интересно где в организме человека хранится "программа" имунной защиты его организма? В идеале именно ее надо "подкорректировать"  химико-биологическим методом (вакциной, препаратом), чтобы имунная система  организма уже заранее знала и узнавала его как враждебный организму объект и умела обезвреживать .
Как по мне, то здесь довольно много направлений для разработок. Успех будет зависеть от того, как много ученые знают о защите  человеческого организма и как много они знают о природе и возможностях самого вируса, его штаммах и способности модифицироваться (мутироваться).  В любом случае это произойдет не быстро. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Can I reupload (and edit) your video to my youtube channel? Your video is very good and have clear explanation. However, many of my undergraduate student do not understand English. Thank you </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 2> Ozone therapy and Plasma therapy

Dr Amato De Monte director of the anesthesia and resuscitation department of the University health compagny of Udine treated 36 covid-19 patients in Italy
 with ozone therapy. 
All patients had pneumonia with respiratory difficulty and were doing oxygen terapy with a cap or helmet.

All patients improve after 3-5 ozone therapy sessions.

Many patients were discharged from the hospital and the only patient who was subsequently intubated was extubated.

You don't have to wait for the patient to be intubated but you have to start treatment in the early stages.

After the first cases treated by Amato De Monte, a clinical trial began in various italian hospitals with ozone therapy.

The results have been excellent, they can be read on the website www.ossigenoozonoterapia.it or you can write to info@ossigenoozono.it

Dr Giuseppe De Donno head of the pneumology department Carlo Poma of Mantua in Italy has obtained excellent results with plasma therapy.

He also treated a pregnant woman with plasma therapy, he was the first in the world. </COMMENT 2>

<COMMENT 20> 1. Is their a way to trick the virus to release its RNA when it's actually outside the type 2 pneumocytes.
I mean, is there like a "Ploymerase or some thing" that can live in the blood to trick the virus that it's a cell. and ask it to openup the  RNA?

2. Is it even possible to create a Spliceosome that tamper the virus RNA?
 if so, can we get it into these "type 2 pneumocytes" ? </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 3> I feel like someone is cornering Covid-19. Excellent job. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> COVID-19 patients have ARDS symptoms, but they DO NOT actually have ARDS! 
WHY? Because there is no ACE2 Blocked Receptor CAUSED REDUCTION IN ALVEOLI SURFACTANT IN NORMAL ARDS!  And furthermore, COVID-19 patients DO NOT have "tired" diaphragm muscles or any danger of heart failure (unless they have a pre-existing heart disease co-morbitiy, which is not the norm).

That is why doctors, after inadvertently causing the death of tens of thousands of COVID-19 patients, have begun to turn patients face down, so the excess lung fluid does not inhibit oxygenation until the virus can be gotten under control, and, instead of intubing the patient with a ventilator, given them high-flow nasal cannulas (HFNC).
Hyperparic Oxygen would be an even better therapy.

<COMMENT 9> or if you lungs are being 'cooked' by millimeter microwave 5 gee.  Being rolled out RIGHT NOW ALL OVER THE US!... Liars. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> A recently published Swiss study performed a virtual screening of over 606 million compounds with the ambition to discover novel inhibitors for the SARS-CoV-2 main protease. To this date, the study marks the most extensive computational screening for the discovery of SARS-CoV-2 Main protease inhibitors: https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Inhibitors_for_Novel_Coronavirus_Protease_Identified_by_Virtual_Screening_of_687_Million_Compounds/11923239 




They report two natural compounds, (-)-taxifolin and rhamnetin. 

The first shows the best potential among the natural compounds. Remarkably, it is engaged in six direct hydrogen bonds with the Mpro which represents the highest count observed in the selection of compounds. Since hydrogen bonds are a key determinant for drug speciﬁcity, (-)-taxofolin might oﬀer a naturally occurring alternative to the proposed inhibitors CP-1 to CP-12.

The isomer (+)-taxifolin, which is more common in plants, was predicted to have less favourable binding free energies. However, the persian walnut (Juglans regia), Agrimonia pilosa, and japanese cypress (Chamaecyparis obtusa) among others are known to produce glycosides of (-)-taxofolin oﬀering a natural resource for its extraction. 

Glycosylated ﬂavonoids regularly show an increased bioavailability compared to the aglycon. In the organism, these glycosides are cleaved oﬀ by β-glucosidase in the gastrointestinal tract or liver. Since the aglycon already exhibits acceptable pharmacokinetics in rabbits, glycosylated (-)-taxifolin will likely display improved bioavailability as well. 




Taxifolin 3-O-glucoside isomers, [(2R, 3R)-, (2R, 3S)-, (2S, 3R)- and (2S, 3S)-] were isolated from leaves of Chamaecyparis obtuse (Cupressaceae). The (2S, 3S) isomer is a synonym of the (-)-Taxifolin 

https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10575630290033141?journalCode=gnpl19




So according to the results of the Swiss study, Chamaecyparis obtusa leaves can be used as a source of (-)-Taxifolin glycoside to inhibits the virus Main protease (3CLpro) in addition to the use of its oil as a source of phytoncides to mimic the “forest bath” effect.




Interestingly the study also found that among the FDA-approved drugs, Apixaban showed the highest potential, while Rivaroxaban and Betrixaban came 4th and 5th respectively, all three are anti-coagulants. 

We already know that blood clots are common issue with COVID-19 patients. It has also been shown that as a consequence of the elevated presence of blood clots among some COVID-19 patients, high plasmin levels are found. Plasmin was shown to promote the virus entry into cells using ACE2 by cleaving its spike protein: https://neurosciencenews.com/coronavirus-blood-clotting-16185/  https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00013.2020?utm_source=PRV&utm_medium=PressRelease&utm_campaign=4.16.2020&  




Apixaban and Rivaroxaban are already being used in protocols for treating COVID-19 patients in several hospitals, for example: https://emergencymedicinecases.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/COVID-19-Anticoagulation-Algorithm-version_final_1.1.pdf  




So their potential to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro may add up to the logic of using these drugs with COVID-19 patients as anti-coagulants.




The study screening process:

In the ﬁrst step, they performed a shape-based screening with known binders for the SARS-CoV-1 main protease and relevant 3 substructures as template molecules. After the initial shape screening, two diﬀerent docking protocols were applied followed by the assessment with pharmacokinetic ﬁlters to narrow down the number of potential binders. Clustering based on molecular ﬁngerprints was applied to ensure structural diversity of the compounds that were, in the next step, subjected to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Based on the obtained trajectories, the binding free energy of the ligands was quantiﬁed using Molecular Mechanics/Generalized Born Surface Area (MM/GBSA) post-processing. In the last step, they assessed potential toxic eﬀects of the compounds due to the interaction with 16 known oﬀ-targets to make a ﬁnal selection of 12 compounds. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Why is obesity such a problem with covid-19 is it because you have to administer air/oxygen according to weight?  Maybe because circulation is already affected by extra weight? </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> How can we find out if people who are dying of coronavirus have had the flu shot or multiple years of flu shots? How can this information be obtained? If the inflammation is being caused by an overreaction of the immune system, could this be caused by the flu shot? However, if the severe cases have not had the flu shot, then this would be a positive for getting the flu shot. Curiously, nothing about this is mentioned. I wonder why? </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> it is clear by the reaserch done in italy. its clot ! in china they have done only two autopsy, in Italy are doing a proper study through autopsy. anticoagulation teraphy is the most likely correct answer. ventilator are killing people and we all know that! </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Another great presentation. As a cardiologist I appreciate the information and the way it is presented. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> If ventilation is relatively intact and perfusion is compromised why is VA/Q ratio LOW?
It is supposed to be high isn't it? </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Thank you Dr. Seheult for being a voice of scientific reason during this very scary pandemic. With respect to the risk of possible lung injury by using ventilators to treat ARDS as opposed to treating symptoms of HAPE, could you address your thoughts on the possible use of Acetazolamide, Nifedipine and Phosodiesteras Inhibitors as potential countermeasures to treat the symptoms of Covid-19. For your convenience,  a link to a relevant paper published from the Cureus site is provided. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340066464_COVID-19_Nifedipine_Phoshpdiesterase_Inhibitors_Acetazolamide </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Question. How is the High Altitude drug doing with Covid-19? Thank you </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> QUESTION. I heard that the big cities in China, other than Wuhan, didn't get Covid-19 spread. Is that true??? Also, I heard that no Chinese head Government officials got Covid-19. Is that true?? Thank you </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Are you afraid of death? Not sure what I should do? Jesus is the solver. Jesus is the savior. Jesus is the only light in the chaotic world. Satan deceives you. What has Satan given you? It's all about cheating, lying, killing, stealing, and perishing. Come to Jesus. Rest and receive eternal life. In front of Jesus' name, all powers and demons kneel down. I am the way, the truth, and the life. Only  comes to the Father except through me. John 14: 6
You who want to believe in Jesus.If you who have COVID19, come to Jesus. Be healed in the name of Jesus, If you plagued by ghosts. If you wanna believe Jesus, Please say this words. "Jesus, I believe in Jesus. Jesus is the Son of God and my savior. you poured water and blood on the cross for my sins.And Jesus were resurrection in three days and I believe Jesus come back when in last world time." </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 3> Covid has never been a worry for me nor has the more deadly common flu. I certainly wong be sticking any "vaccine" in me either.. leave that for the weak and scared, which seems like half the population lol.. pussies </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> And again the MSM including CNBComedy, The Lancent (leftist pseudo research), Harvard, WHO, Universities and so called 'Researchers' lying about Hydroxychloroquin and Trump is correct, IT WORKS ! : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llZ1uurWLmA </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Nice video </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> HORRIBLE MEDICAL SYSTEM IN USA.  POOR DIE RICH LIVES.    NO MEDICAL INSURANCE DEATH SENTENCE IN USA. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> From 3:33 onwards i think it is quite conclusive how much more protection we can get ourselves and give others if everyone wear a mask. WHO has to acknowledge that and be flexible. Surgical masks are always at risk of shortage in supply, but cotton and washable ones i beg to differ - they can easily be handmade. WHO the guy at the helm needs a dose of logic jab. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> I hope this encourages everyone in this difficult time 🙏

<COMMENT 11> Continuons à nous protéger svp écoutez ça et partager massivement. https://youtu.be/ZDlCvJLe-6U </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> The laser scattering detection of droplets does not prove that mask wearing reduces infection.  How long do the imaged droplets linger in the air?   How far do they travel?  Could droplets smaller than those that can be imaged pass through the mask?  Did the speaker emit a cloud of droplets in the vicinity of his face that lingered in the air?  What is the potential viral load on a droplet?  How many droplets would a person have to breathe to become infected? </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> What I’d like to know is how necessary is a mask when walking around outside.  For example, if I’m walking to Trader Joe’s in NYC a mile away, is the mask necessary while walking outside?  Reasonable # of people out, not crowded.  Quickly walking by.  Can someone actually quantify the risk?  Because when the weather gets hot and humid here, wearing a mask will become problematic.  It already contributes to a certain breathlessness and headache.  To me, the risk of infection seems quite low. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> The pandemic is a fraud to establish global control, David Icke https://www.bitchute.com/channel/weBLW8e6mgIB/ Alex Jones https://banned.video/channel/the-alex-jones-show 20 interviews with experts, 1 interview involves 150 doctors https://freedomplatform.londonreal.tv/ </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Great video as always.  The visualizing droplets video was really interesting.  The mask used was actually "a slightly damp washcloth over the speakers mouth."  It would be interesting to see a test with dry and slightly damp cloth masks, along with the medical grade masks.  On a different note It seems to me that we should be pumping up primary care to work up patients early on to determine those who are at risk to progress to serious disease (elevated D-dimer, IL markers, etc.) as well as having the opportunity to start the potentially useful antivirals before the storm.  Thank you both for the tremendous service you are providing. </COMMENT 15>

<COMMENT 11> Yay we flatten the curb!
What do we do now?




We can go outside again </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Stay Clean Kids. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> There are many variables that make this presentation incomplete. This should be  compared and combined with other data and re-evaluated. For one, not a single "lilypad" is the same. Some are healthier than others. Second, lets not forget the impact of the environment we live in. The world is a big place, and some places are downright toxic for humans but a breeding ground for viruses, and vice versa: some places are good for humans to live in, but are deadly for viruses. There are just too many other aspects that, when taken into consideration, would deliver a more accurate presentation -- especially since we've learnt a lot more about the virus by now. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> So 'flattening the curve' means 'lengthening the curve'? </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Let’s not forget about the other ways people will suffer with this virus as some politicians keep people from working. Must be nice to be rich and not worry about such things. Perhaps shove sock people into nursing homes...yeah, that’ll help. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> 1.If we would have listened when they announced the corona virus it wouldn't have blown up inner face and less people would've died
2.they showed two different places one graph showing how much people got sick from going to the a parade in  Philadelphia  in 1918 when the worst influenza hit and there was over 200,000 people who attended and they lost 4,500 people but in St. Louis after two days detecting the first case they shut everything down the graph was lower then Philadelphia 
3.exponential  growth is scary but doesn't last forever </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> infection </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Almost 2 thousand people are dumb enough to understand the current issue we fight. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> First it was cancer now it’s covid-19..
Stay safe everyone. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> But there's one point you're missing: SARS 2 only affects elderly or chronically sick people, so I think governments should have quarantined and protected them beforehand and not let thousands of healthy adults get unemployed! </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 14> Fabulous!  Thank you Raul! </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Awesome </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> As a purveyor and fan of lyric bastardizations AND an inveterate fan of Queen,  I was prepared for a cute/meh/ho-hum response. Instead I am ecstatic with admiration of every approximate rhyme and of the harmonies and the timing (song and action).. Spot on. Not just the song, but the message. Sorry I am coming so late to this. Amazing how fast things become dated in the Now Times. It was fast enough in the Before Times! In MY mind, it is easy enough to substitute a "wear a mask" message for the "wash your hands" lines. Even that is so Last Week. . Thanks for this! </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Absolutely fabulous!  Thanks for taking the time to create this, post this and entertain the %#&^$%@ out of me!! </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Fantastic video. But, as I watch the domestic terrorists commit arson and loot big screen TVs, there will be truth in 30 days. They'll be dead or masks and socialist distancing will be shown to be the non-cure to the non-disease.  NOTE TO ELDERLY TERRORISTS: If you are over 50 years old, you should wear a mask when you get that TV. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Amazing, fanny and very talented! Thank you! </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Wow!  so talented.  the singing, the lyrics, video!  Well done! </COMMENT 20>

 https://sites.google.com/site/mycovid19pandemicvideodiaries/
The COVID-19 pandemic first appeared in Greece on 26
February 2020. - The measures put in place in Greece are among the most
proactive and strictest in Europe and have been credited internationally for
having slowed the spread of the disease and having kept the number of deaths
among the lowest in Europe.. Starting from 24 May, after a long lockdown,
Greece began to gradually lift restrictions on movement and to restart business
activity. Internet Cafe's Restarted 
Business. So here I am again.

Thanks for sharing God bless.. Please visiting in my home... </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> There are 2 proteolytic enzymes sold over the counter that may offer significant help to the clotting and the cytokine storme problem, nattokinase and serrapeptase.  Nattokinase is fibrinolytic and serrapeptase cuts chemical signals, cytokines, that produce inflammation etc.  RBY </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> This is exactly what the mainstrem media has been telling us just using more technical terms. All of these words mean they died of pneumonia and multisystem inflammation, causing blood clots. This is actually meant for healthcare professionals who can understand the medical terminology. Very good though. </COMMENT 8>

<COMMENT 10> 🗣💩 </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> the cause of death of the people of the  pandemic is not the cause of covid . </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Well, why are they forcing masks on elderly?  You know how bad that is.  Breathing carbon dioxide all day is a blood clot waiting to happen, isn't it? </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> im just wondering...why wouldn't families want their loved ones to have autopsies? </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> YOU PLEASE .I'M BEGGING  FOR YOUR HELP WE COILD SAVE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ONCE U SEE HOW THEY ARE SPREADING  IT PLEWSW I'M BEGGING  U AS A HUMAN BEING </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> i am from India ... i am curious to know if turmeric that we Indians add to our curries does protect us? ... in past when chilies were not in use in India Indian curries used to use black pepper and dried fruits of other Piper genera vines and innumerable Apiaceae family seeds and leaves as spices ... do any of these protect us? </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Great presentation Dr Hansen,  we appreciate your work, thanks </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Reopen back our lives!!! </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> This Corona virus crap is not real....stop already! Judgement is coming for the wicked. Lies, lies, lies brought to you by the illuminati! Satanic devil worshipers....king Jesus is on his way! Be afraid Be very afraid! </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Didn't understand many things till first 12mins... Wish that pictures shown were coloured.... But last bit was better...

But can't help whenever I see organs I think of Hannibal.... 

I will subscribe the channel for sure.. 

Thanks for ur medical videos..... 

But please make the videos more simple... And also tell do's n don't.. Could also pls make a list for symptoms of corona such as u get this or that....eg pneumonia is a symptom I. E. One of the byproduct of corona and this medicine takes care of pneumonia... 

Since I stay in India and we also take Ayurvedic medicine(it has no side effects since it's only herbs) at times  so for those  symptoms I can consult an aurvedic doctor and take a course of medicine... Hope that boosts my immunity... My psorasis attack got cured by Aurvedic doctor.... 

Pls make a list of all the symptoms of corona like (1) pneumonia, (2) patchy lungs etc... Than towards the rt column their symptoms and other information... Than followed by how an individual will feel if they get that... </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 2> Thank you for the well laid out explanation.  This must have taken a great deal of time to put together.  In addition, thanks for not talking down to us. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> It’s like some horror disease out of plague inc or a pandemic movie. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> And thanks for not talking down to us. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> im 5'7 and weight 210 lbs,  am I at risk? </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> After watching this video now I think there must be taken the biggest effort possible to get hold of an important biological vulnerability of that virus. We must seek for exacly such weaknesses in the viral DNA to prevent/stop it from multiplying. A genetical "switch" or "scissor" or "lockout" factor to freeze its multiplication. or to disrupt its DNA into pieces right in the place where it multiplies in our body. We must catch it right in the act, not late when all the damage already has been done to tissue, vessels, cells. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> 😘😘😘🥰🥰🥰 </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> When you said the word; Police! My anxiety increases 😨 </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> No where is these videos do you show a definitive study for virus. Did you actually look and find a virus? And document that?? </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> I've had C19 my wife says l'm heartless </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> This sounds like something that was engineered in a lab </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> U r very professional! </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> That’s what all viruses, I thought, do: make millions of copies of themselves. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Nah.. kan Obesitas ada </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> This thing can look like every illness out there and it can kill a lot of different ways.  Yes, that is very scary!  And for someone like me who has to travel for my job to support my family, and when I travel it is to visit clinics and hospitals, it has me pretty anxious!  This is the sort of thing that makes you realize how fragile we are as humans.  I don’t worry about myself as much as my family and those that I love.  I will do my best to stay safe, but I have to take care of my family by putting myself out there. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Aching joints? </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Seems like they're calling everything covid19. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> This guy should be ashamed of himself which he won't be. </COMMENT 18>

<COMMENT 1> 🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼  Proud of Taiwan </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> I hope I can visit Taiwan when all world conditions and situations are good.

*Taiwan, You are Great!* 👍👍👍 </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Bravo Tiawan: the movie CONTAGION is rated PG-13 : they are showing it to what looks like 6 year olds at least their children are psychologically prepared by seeing images of sick and dying people unlike the children in the West that still believe in Santa at that age and think their only job is to play!! </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> School next after covid 19 </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Showing them some bs Hollywood movie to scare them, great job people. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> with  innate disciplined students   ,teachers and government  going back to school might be safe despite pandemic </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> amazing! i'm just amazed! </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> these are the steps the west should learn. why kids can't wear the masks in the school in UK? The shoes should be sanitised too. Think about all the reception kids seating on the floor and don't even have a chair in UK. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> People are very cooperative.... I hope everyone in the country are like this.... No wonder they have flattened the curve </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> We need to have a mainland Taiwan a reality in this generation!!! </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Hope🙏👌🙏 </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Student chief disinfectant officer👍👌👍 </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> taiwan = proactive vs singapore = reactive </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> It's amazing </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> i hate china and cannot learn anything from them </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> This is so cute- the kids </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> People who don’t put on masks will pay a price..... </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Way to go Taiwan! </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> I work in a school in Maryland and it’s sad to say that pretty much all our students are behind or gonna be behind once this ends </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Do not bring this political. It is not yours to say whether a country is to be independent. It is all about power and politics of each country. It is between China and Taiwan (territory). So pls, if ur not Taiwanese or Chinese, I don’t think ur opinion matters. But seriously wtf, u say the rest of the world failed bcz if they trusted CCP??? They have been doing absolutely NOTHING during January and February! And spring break!! Aven a 9th grader like meee expected a wide spread of covid19 after spring break: people travelling to Japan and Italy without quarantining themselves and using “human rights” as an excuse to be irresponsible and spread the virus. You know what I think, the government (USA Canada UK, etc)  is only PARTIALLY responsible for this global pandemic, the PEOPLE are mainly responsible. There is no one to blame but yourselves... </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 2> Gulp </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> why are you not telling the truth about where the Covid -19 virus actually came from. It was not from an animal to human. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Kids are dying too. Get this updated quickly </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Like for corona warriors 👍👍👍 </COMMENT 5>

<COMMENT 8> Huh so you believed China ? That's cute </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Isaiah 43:1 “Don't fear, for I have redeemed you; I have called you by name; you are Mine.” God actually commands us not to fear, or worry. The phrase “fear not” is used at least 80 times in the Bible, most likely because He knows the enemy uses fear to decrease our hope and limit our victories. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> This video seems like Chinese propaganda </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Thanks to the nurses who gave their lives to cure strangers in need. 🙏🏼 </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Mutated. Covid 19 fatality rate > elderly. Quarantine, testing. 80% mild. ARDS: fluid build up. Cough/Sneeze spreads. Incubation period 5 days. Ro= how quickly it spreads. PR+PCR Test.  Supportive care. Clinical trials with Meds. Mask & self  quarantine. Human to dog transmission. High Risk: self quarantine. N95 mask for healthcare workers. Healthcare workers: PPE. N95 respirator. SARS CoV-2 causes COVID 19. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Warning! The moment you are reading this. There is a deadly virus that is killing millions! So help yourself by washing your hands when you’re going to eat. Also, bring some hand sanitizer when you go out so your hands stay clean. Stay safe, friend. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> I LOVE your citations at the end. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Study based on china mortality so some fact are wrong because china miss guiding with data </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Honestly, you can’t even get a break off of the news carrying on about COVID-19, I’m not saying that they shouldn’t but nobody actually gets it anyways most of the time. I can’t even cough or sneeze once without some imbecile thinking I have the "Coronavirus”. In my opinion everyone is kind of taking it a bit too serious. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Where's your proof that it went into a pangulen? Or are you being a parrot. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> It's sad that it took COVID-19 to bring us together. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> So somebody shagged a Pangolin after stuffing a dead Bat up it's arse and that's where this codswallop comes from,Thank fuck our government loves us. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Best Covid19 SarsCov2 awareness video..

Although people MUST wear face masks while going out.. Symptomatic or not..

Hats off for the tribute to Dr. Li in the end.

<COMMENT 1> Good thing I graduated army training this past December. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Bruh I just got outta basic and there were 20+ cases of Covid in my platoon alone. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Currently at basic and just finished during this, covid made this crap suck at fort Sill </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> covid-19 free testing sites are giving you fake results sometimes they tell the truth </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Get your freakin distance soldiers </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> The lockdown paranoia has gone on long enough. Change my mind </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> I was wondering about the impacts this pandemic has on the Army, weeeekkkks ago. I wasn't finding any really informative videos about this. Thank you Insider! </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Basic training not boot camp </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> We spent a lot of money on army but not on things that matter </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> *Basic Training* </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Holy crap my last name is Brito too! </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Us ARMY "boot camp." What? BOOT CAMP? </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Hey! Tactical dispersion! </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> So if none of them are sick going in, and they continue to do screenings, they've been in for more than 2 weeks and still no cases, why tf do they gotta social distance </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> The United States has encouraged Belarus to conclude and adhere to
agreements with the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
on the program of macroeconomic stabilization and related reform measures, as
well as to undertake increased privatization and to create a favorable climate
for business and investment. Although there has been some American direct
private investment in Belarus, its development has been relatively slow given
the uncertain pace of reform


how about u treat "europeans"(russians) the same way u treat
arabs mr trump?


uncertain pace of reform means i take ur money and do nothing


shame on the usa </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> BRO IM SO LUCKY
My bootcamp was last August man if i had waited a few momths i wouldve been fucked </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Army basic training? or it's now Boot Camp </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Maneuver of excellence </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> My advice, Don't join!!! Only sickness your gonna get is the toxic leadership. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> just finished 19d osut when corona started. it sucked, had to stay at double arm intervals, wear the mask, and never got to eat at the dfac (when it started). but i did get the national defense service medal for it🤷🏻‍♂️ </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 2> Jai une bpco  stade 2 avancée...auel serait la conséquence avec se virus qui attaque directement les bronche sur ma santé ?   évidemment j'attends pas une réponse d'elle...peut quelqu un et dans ma situation.... </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> J'ai attrapé le covid19 le mois dernier. Certes je me sens guéri actuellement mais j'ai l'impression d'avoir une insuffisance respiratoire. J'ai du mal à respirer comme avant. Cette insuffisance n'est pas accentuée car il m'arrive de faire des activités physiques mais jsuis vite essoufflé du coup que faire pour retrouver ma respiration à 100%
Sur une échelle de 1 à 10 ( ma capacité à respirer)
Disons que j en suis à 7 
Merci de me répondre </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> ...ne dites pas "il n'existe pas de traitement" c'est faux, la chloroquine combinée à l'azithromycine, qui est un antibiotique, en est un et il fonctionne dans la majorité des cas traités ! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfiUlVpqHfE </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Bonjour, Avez-vous eu des retours sur une atteinte du myocarde après avoir contracté le covid-19 ? Merci </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> une reaction immunitaire(inflammatoire) hors controle par l'organisme lui méme,c'est la redoutable toxicité de ce virus.
comme si l'infection devenait une maladie auto-immune .
Neamoins ce phenomene est connu, semble -t-il,dans d 'autres atteintes pulmonaires, comment ce fait il,que nous
soyons si demunis de solutions? </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Vous dites qu'il s'agit d'eau dans le poumon mais est ce comparable a un oedeme pulmonaire dans quel cas l'usage de diueretique pourrait s'averer opportun ? </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Bien Le Bonjour , pouvez vous nous expliquer le protocole de réanimation ? Par exemple pourquoi doit-on retourner les malade sur le ventre ... ? </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Ça s'appelle une embolie pulmonaire </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Si il y a une réaction exacerbée de nos défenses immunitaires qui engendre une forte inflammation est ce que les immunosuppresseurs sont protecteurs ? </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Pourquoi certaines personnes deviennent-elles gravement malades à cause d'un coronavirus, alors que d'autres sont asymptomatiques et ne ressentent presque rien?

Trois raisons :

·   Les problèmes de santé (86,5 % des décès à New York présentent au moins une comorbidité)

·   Choix de mode de vie

·   Vos gènes

Analysons ce dernier point.
Si vous comprenez vos gènes, vous pouvez mettre en œuvre des changements de régime alimentaire, de compléments et de mode de vie qui peuvent optimiser votre santé et vous rendre plus résistant au COVID-19 et aux complications qui y sont liées.

Nous sommes au XXIe siècle et nous ne devrions plus avoir besoin de nous fier aux suppositions généralistes du XXe siècle pour savoir ce qui peut aider alors que la connaissance des prédispositions permet d’adapter plus efficacement les stratégies préventives.
Ceux qui ont fait séquencer leur génome disposent des outils nécessaires pour se concentrer sur l’utile et comprendre ce qui pourrait les aider en examinant leur ADN.

Nos gènes peuvent nous dire si nous avons des variantes à risque ou non qui :

·   Nous rendent plus susceptibles de contracter un coronavirus

·   Nous rendent plus susceptibles de développer des complications

Certaines sociétés analysant le génome sont capables d’établir une liste interne de recommandations permettant de contrecarrer les variantes génétiques qui pourraient vous mettre en danger.

Trois exemples clés :

·   Le gène ACE2 - Entrée dans vos cellules

Considérez les récepteurs ACE2 comme des portes d'entrée pour le coronavirus, car c'est ainsi qu'il peut pénétrer dans vos cellules.
Plus de récepteurs ACE2 signifie plus de portes pour que le coronavirus puisse facilement entrer dans vos cellules et les « hacker ».

Votre gène ACE2 joue un rôle important dans le nombre de récepteurs dont vous disposez.
Certaines variantes sont associées à une expression accrue des récepteurs ACE2, si bien que si vous êtes porteur de cette variante, vous pourriez être plus susceptible de contracter le virus.

L’intérêt de savoir est que si vous savez de quelle variante vous êtes porteur, vous saurez quelle mesure préventive vous devez prendre pour essayer d'empêcher que vos récepteurs ACE2 ne facilitent l’entrée du COVID-19.
L’analyse personnalisées permet de prendre des mesures préventives basées sur vos gènes.

 

·   Gène MX1 - Empêcher le virus de se propager

Le MX1 est important pour la réponse de l'organisme aux virus qu'il n'a jamais rencontrés auparavant.
Comme le COVID-19 est nouveau, ce gène joue un rôle important dans la lutte contre les coronavirus.

Le gène MX1 code pour une protéine qui aide à empêcher les virus de se répliquer et de se propager dans l'organisme.
Malheureusement, les coronavirus peuvent supprimer cette protéine, ce qui permet aux virus de se reproduire sans que le MX1 ne les en empêche.

Cependant, certaines variantes génétiques permettent au MX1 de fonctionner par d'autres moyens, malgré l'interférence des coronavirus.

Si vous savez que vous possédez la variante à risque du MX1, assurez-vous de mettre en œuvre certaines recommandations spécifiques.

 

·   Gène IL-6 - Tempêtes de cytokines

Le gène IL-6 est SUPER important pour le COVID-19. 
À vérifier en premier quand c’est possible.

Ce gène est associé à 3 aspects liés au COVID-19 :

·   Sensibilité aux infections respiratoires

·   Tempêtes de cytokines

·   SDRA (syndrome de détresse respiratoire aiguë)

Les tempêtes de cytokines surviennent lorsque le système immunitaire surproduit des cytokines inflammatoires, qui endommagent alors notre corps au lieu de le protéger.
De nombreux chercheurs et médecins sont de plus en plus convaincus que beaucoup de décès dus au COVID-19 sont dus à des tempêtes de cytokines.

Un excès d'IL-6 contribue à de dangereuses tempêtes de cytokines, et il existe même un lien direct entre le taux d'IL-6 et la gravité de l'infection virale.

Non seulement ces associations génétiques existent, mais elles sont étayées par des études qui montrent que les niveaux d'IL-6 dans le sang sont en corrélation avec la gravité de la maladie et la probabilité de complications.

Les professionnels de la santé s'accordent désormais sur l'importance de l'IL-6 lors des complications du COVID-19.

C'est pourquoi, si vous avez été séquencé, vous devez vérifier si vous avez les variantes du gène IL-6 qui augmentent ces niveaux et peuvent vous prédisposer à des infections respiratoires plus graves, vous laissant plus vulnérable au COVID-19. </COMMENT 11>

<COMMENT 3> Anders Tegnell's nightmare is coming true as new normal in our country. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> It's hard tu handling Country with hundred million  population of people. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Our government is deeply stupid, we need someone inthe administration death because of covid. So this government could stop ignoring. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> For those who blame ignorance. Ignorance has been here since long time ago. It's not a new issue.
The question is, can ignorance be changed?

If someone build a school in a backward area. They should not lament the low quality of students. But strive to improve them. That's not the case in Indonesia. Teacher said they already teached their best. It's the student that cannot learn. End of story. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> As an Indonesian I'm very disappointed in this country even though I love it very much, some citizens in Indonesia are just too ignorant </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Strategies learned from successful countries VS Indonesia
1. Massive fast PCR test ❌
2. Tight surveillance system❌
3. Lockdown/strict control movement+mask ❌
4. Strict penalty rules ❌
5. Close border ❌
6. Top medical capacity ❌

<COMMENT 9> You can do it Indonesian love from Philippines 🙏 </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> YOU CAN DO IT INDONESIA...NEVER GIVE UP...JUST FOLLOW THE RULES...FROM MALAYSIA </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> thank you very much Indonesia for giving the fabunan antiviral injection a chance to have a clinical studies in your country,its an honor for us(Filipinos),we are hoping that it will be a successful one in fighting the covid 19 virus,rest assured it is a great invention of fabunan doctors that was not appreciated by our own country Philippines,being underestimated by our own doctors in the government,again,thank you very much,God bless Indonesia! </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> The president of Indonesia acts the same way as the president of USA where they both treating the virus as its not a big deal. The overwhelming deaths are the result of the inaction of these presidents. There are horrible leaders. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Berita taik buat jatuhkan nkri </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Fake issue </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Well, most of the comments said indonesia govt lack of bla bla, yes they are. But it seems ignorance that some people denying the number population of indonesia is huge, in jakarta metropolitan area only they have approx 40 millions people, the size is 6 times larger than singapore. The fact is indonesia have 270 mio something citizen. Yet they not yet a developed country, with limited budget for education, better healthcare system etc. I think not all indonesian are ignorance about the outbreak, they do aware this is a big deal and they aware that govt have to put more effort on it. Comments about indonesia without understanding the big picture is absolutely an ignorance, and i think their health ministry said about that to calm down its citizen to not get panic, i saw some rich jakartans just panic buying during early pandemic and well this is not a good thing. Government tried their best. God bless you indonesia </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> My country isn't perfect in battling the pandemic, but I think that the government and citizens should be united upon overcoming this pandemic. The government of Indonesia should give a brief and clear rules and the citizens should obey the rules implemented. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> This happens because of the government's bureaucratic mess and corruption. The citizens rely heavily on the government's authority, aid, and information. I heard rumors that when the central government give aid to its people through the regional government, the regional government pocketed some of that money when it supposed to be given to the people who lose their jobs.

Side note: Correct me if I'm wrong. I'm just an Indonesian who is experiencing and hearing some rumors, not a politician. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> That is stupid. The more the people is aware of a problem, the better they are in countering it. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> We have here in the Philippines the anti dote for covid 19. You might want to try the Fabunan Antiviral Injection. its worth a try if the protocol in your country permits it. In the Philippines just like any other inventions develop by Filipinos has not been given attention from Filipino engineers that shines in the US their works in mars moon and etc...you name it there a Filipino behind..Now try Fabunan Antiviral Injection it may help you a lot. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Fun fact, 95% people believe, if you always praying the virus will gone by itself, and because that, they ignore social distancing </COMMENT 20>

Who would like to see a chinese dominated world economic system. The dominant power has to be able to show responsability.... and clearly this is not what China did. Nor China has allowed independant examination to find the first case of contamination so that at least the other countries are able to protect their population.   This epidemy has shown that it is highly undesirable to have a world system dominated by  communist China. </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 5> Yes, the Bat Lady has been working on this virus for years...she altered the genetic code to make it more infectious to humans. See the Epoch Times documentary. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> This covid 19 is more like a movie. Someone made the virus to make it I don't know , maybe to take their enemies down or something. And,now everyone has to  suffer and survive including me😔. It pisses me off, it makes me sad I don't know what to feel anymore , the Chinese government should pay for this.😠 </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> It's not a question, it's the obvious, this virus is obviously made by humans, wouldn't be surprised China had the aim to stop some protests with it maybe?... People and power, such a bad combination, the whole world should throw down current leaderships and start allover by real chosen people!

Personally anything from China is a boycot for me, join the resistance! </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> My dad got it 🦠 </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> I swear to God I’m not lying my dad. Got the virus </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> The question is when this China will have to pay their damages around the world? I will not buy anything made in china! </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> look a china/american woman talking about China hmmm that's coincidence 🤣🤣🤣😂🤣🤣 </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> so china, finally showing your cards huh? </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> THIS IS NOT GOOD AT ALL I WILL NO LONGER EAT CHINESE FOOD AGAIN I WILL NEVER BUY ANYTHING MADE IN CHINA </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> bill gates together with his eugenics beastly mates are behind this man-made COVID 19 </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> What i found out was,

America had caught the virus first. It originated from a man in his early 30’s with 2 children and a wife. The virus was spread through America and people were obviously travelling to China at the time then the Chinese had caught the virus.

And the public had made rumours it started from eating aborted babies and bats. </COMMENT 15>

<COMMENT 1> we have nothing else for dengue.  everybody’s obsessed with this  antibodies are supposed to be protective. it turns out that low levels of antibodies cannot neutralize the invading viruses, they  bind to them then they effectively usher them into susceptible cells. in the cells  the viruses  replicate.having had one type of dengue increases your risk of having severe illness if you have a second infection. if you have never had dengue do not get the vaccine.  with this covid antibody level is expected to become less over just one year of time that is the way it seems to work for immunity to these type of viruses. we are going to go there and maybe we will end up just fine. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Ebola ..... They're eating bushmeat bats ...monkeys... God knows what else......... Covid and SARS ..... And there eating bats and god knows what else......!!??!??!!! </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Thank you Emily toenail......?!!?? </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Have u noticed how his voice doesn't match his lip sync ........?!?!??? </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Thank you....It is all enlightening and I feel even more will be learned...Just like the next major topic= Vaccines....Don’t be me. I am an M.D. but let me tell you what you do not know about vaccines and what I didn’t know and what 90% of all M.D.'s do not know and what No politician knows... I did not know that Vaccines had not been tested against any placebo (ever). 

I did not know that animal testing would be skipped for the future COVID vaccines..I did not know the 30+ ingredients used in vaccines. I did not know that there are neurotoxic aluminum and mercury molecules in vaccines. I did not know enough to research vaccines before vaccinating my own children. 

I did not know that my own precocious, active, talking son would be vaccine-injured. I did not know that my own baby brother (also an M.D.) would become paralyzed (Guillain-Barre) and then die after his swine flu vaccine in the same hospital (Shands) where he had received his medical training. I did not know that my mother(an R.N.) would get 8 vaccines in 1 day to "catch-up" with newly added CDC vaccines to keep her job as Head Nurse in the Largest Hospital in the county and then get such severe, aggressive, progressive brain fog in days and become unable to dial a phone or push an elevator button or remember any of her  5 children in a few weeks and then have this "dementia" progress and then die in diapers.

I did not know that vaccines were given a blanket indemnity from liability in 1986 and now total immunity for all COVID vaccines for the future. I did not know that we gave more vaccines than any other country starting on day #1...I did not know that we have the highest rate of SIDS of the top 35 industrialized countries... I did not know that we had more autism than any other country... I did not know that Vaccines could injure an infant's brain. 

I did not know that vaccines can result in autoimmunity and neurological damage. I did not know that herd immunity does not apply to vaccines and is a myth created by the CDC. I did not know that Vaccines have almost no effect after about four years. 

I did not know how emotional the topic would be and how angry people would be at me for just asking questions about Vaccine Safety. I did not know that pediatricians were paid to give vaccines. I did not know that the CDC owned the Patents on so many vaccines. 
I did not know that the NIH stands to make Billions of dollars on a COVID vaccine. 

I did not know how angry at myself I would be for not knowing. I did not know that the CDC committed fraud and destroyed their evidence in their vaccine safety studies when it showed vaccines can cause autistic neurological changes..I did not know that a whistleblower came forward with all the evidence but he was silenced. I did not know that Merck committed fraud in their vaccine research repeatedly. I did not know that aluminum molecules in the vaccine ingredients is connected to brain inflammation and brain inflammation has been proven to be connected to autism. 
I did not know that vaccines contained human cells from aborted fetuses..

I did not know how much mainstream media would censor the independent research that showed these facts...I did not know that 90% of all vaccine research that the CDC and FDA use to "approve" vaccines are done by the scientists hired by vaccine makers..I did not know if we were alone... I did not know how many other millions of parents and families in the world have been affected by vaccine reactions..I did not know how many would find, join, and share the Facebook help group= Vaccine Support Group on Facebook..I did not know that FB would delete the scientific medical research that had been suppressed, deleted, or censored until it happened to us...  Dr.MAS.. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> The amount of propaganda is the problem! </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> The video pertaining to the Biology and Evolution of Covid 19.Mr.Subramani and the Three Guest have given very good useful resources about the Covid 19 virus. And also what to be expected about the second out break of the corona virus Pandemic. And from my perspective the corona virus has its Advantages and Disadvantages and there so much to learn and gain about this Virus. When someone test positive for the corona virus immune system is low or weak lack of Vitamins A,B,C,D,E,K for strong immune system with healthy eating Habits drinking plenty of water also daily excerise. Hand washing, Social distancing,Wearing Masks. Stay safe everyone Be well. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> I am a BIOLOGIST.    What is with the testing?  Don't  have it today but after the test have it tomorrow.  The virus is in the body of junk eating PEOPLE all over the world. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> boiler-plate molecular virology, milk-toast "nice tree!" tell-nothing phylogenetics, pipe dreaming about molecular-evolutionary constraints.  But the biology of cov19 that truly matters now is the mass action of the epidemic dynamics (mainly the asymptomatics!) and these dynamics' side effects in the form of patients overwhelming hospitals.  Asymptomatics are nuclear to the dynamics but here they show up for 1 microsecond. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> When your teacher makes you watch this for your final  -_- </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> IM STILL WAITING AS TO WHEN TRUMP DUMMY WITH THE TRUMP DUMMY SYNDROME IS GOING TO DECORATE THE SURVIVING PERSONNEL. THAT WAS DEPLOYED ON SECRET MISSION THAT IM SURE WAS PERFECTLY EXECUTED AND THE BRAVERY THAT IT TOOK TO FIRST HANDLE AND FIGHT THE NEW VIRUS? OR AN OLDER NEW ONE AGAIN FOR YOU KNEW WHERE TO GET THE EBOLA VIRUS TO PLAY WITH. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> How ironic is it that none of these big pharma educated, financed, propagandist meat puppets never mentioned how accurate are these RT-PCR test, why Koch postulates have never been used to prove that this particular virus really is the cause of this disease, and why did then inventor of the RT-PCR stated emphatically that this test should not be used in diagnosing infectious disease! I will be patiently waiting for their answers. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> ITS EASY TO DRAW MAPS AND CLAIM THAT YOUR MAP IS CORRECT, BUT THE WARSHIP AT SEA CAUGHT THE VIRUS FROM WHERE? I THINK THEY HAD IT FIRST CAUSE IT WAS THEIR MISSION TO INFECT THE WORLD UNDER TRUMP DUMMY DICTATORSHIP DO WE ALL LOOK THE OTHER WAY, AND PRETEND TO BE UNAWARE.  YOUR MAP THE FIRST LINE,  START WITH THE WARSHIP. THERE WAS EIGHT HUNDRED PLUS INFECTED WHEN COMING TO PORT, THE VIRUS WAS WITH THEM BEFORE THE CRUISE SHIPS GETTING THE VIRUS, ALSO THE SHIP HAD THE FIRST DEATH CASES OF THE AMERICANS THAT WAS NOT DISCLOSED AT THE TIME DUE TO TOP SECRET MISSION. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Hiya to all of you the fantastic Four. As per Elizabeth's comments below. Thankyou. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> This ass hole is so full of shit! Look at his body language he can't help himself </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> I WANT TO SEND A A MESSAGE TO WUHAN, WE KNOW,  WE ARE WATCHING YOU WUHAN P4 LAB. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Nice discussion. Unfortunately, the medical professional has become big business, promoting profit over practice and are now as corrupt as politicians. I remember when I was younger, it seemed the medical profession and especially medical insurance companies were "non-profit".
Now it only matters the bottom line. no more Chickens for a checkup. If they remained non-profit and the government offered grants to offset the greed factor, there could still be innovation among the brightest scholars. The jury is out on the current leaders in the medical profession, everything from competition and theft of patents, to actually illegally involved in the cause for many viruses. Two things are fact. The leading mouthpiece for CV-2 held back a cure for HIV when he could have saved millions of lives, and he also bragged about the effects of HCQ while it was still under patent. We need to fire all the Doctors in suits and bring in good old fashion country doctors whos' first and ONLY responsibility is to their patients. My outlook in life is, if you do good work, you will win praise and wealth. It should not be automatically given to people who make educated guesses for a living, with little to no accountability.
If someone came out with a pill that cured or prevented Cancer, they would be suicided before they reached the patent office. Take the many zero-point energy inventors as a vast example. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Very ideal hosting and presenting 👏🏻 </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Why don’t I know of anyone with it?  When the flue is going around I’ll typically know of about five people at any time with it.
So many lies.  I had a weird cold flue in January like many other people I know.  It lingered.  That was probably the Wuhan virus back then.
It is said that it probably arrived in North America in October.
The economic shutdown is probably a NWO agenda. </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 1> We’re suffering from fools gov, other ppl wants revolutions free from indonesia occupy ex Aceh, West java, west Papua. Wants free and declare independence </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Indonesian ministers are arrogant ... they think they are the best ... they are undermining WHO's warning on covid 19. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Please feature the Philippines next. Our President's incompetence put our lives in danger. Up until now there is no concrete plan and proper breakdown of billions of pesos we loaned. If they banned the flights from China earlier this year the cases won't be that much. Oh yeah, The President of the Philippines is Communist China's lapdog. There are alot of arrested illegal Chinese immigrants doing illegal activities arrested during quarantine.  There's no report that they have been deported. Recently, there's a flight directly from Wuhan, China (Ground Zero of the virus) to Philippines. The report says it was only   cargo which we highly doubt. It doesn't sound so bad when the President's troll supporters who are probably paid or blinded with privilege are justifying his actions.

To the International bodies, we Filipinos need your help. </COMMENT 3>

<COMMENT 3> And I wander if being a loner makes me stupid still. People are just a literal Payne in my respiratory system. Oh wait. I dont hang around people I stick to myself. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> A lot of doctors are beginning to think maybe mechanical ventilation may not be correct initially. Some of these pts are coming in with SATs of 50% with no distress!  They are not struggling to breathe as with ARDS. They have named this happy hypoxemia! A Dr Joseph Fair had the virus and waited too long before calling 911 and going to the ED. They asked him if he wanted to be intubated. Naturally as a doctor he said no. Instead they gave him very high % oxygen. It worked. A lot of frontline doctors are rethinking immediately going to the ventilator. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Another khan academy video </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> I came across a book that discusses Cytikine Storms. It says that the HMGB1 needs to be reduced. It suggested several herbs: Angelica sinensis; Salvia miltiorrhiza; licorice constituent glycerrhizin directly binds. Green tea component epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) also inhibits ; counterintuitively nicotine also lowers it. The pharmaceutical minocycline can be helpful. I hope this helps. </COMMENT 6>

<COMMENT 11> Is is true, as I have read, that 50-80% of covid-19 patients who go onto a vent die on the vent? If it is true, then we shouldn't look at the vent as a life-saver, or rather we shouldn't think that if we get into that kind of trouble, the vent will save us. It won't save a large percent of those who go onto one, and even it you do survive, you may have sustained significant lung damage that will be with you for the rest of your life. So I would think that the main life-saving, if it is to occur at all, would happen by the proper treatment early on, 'before' ventilation becomes the only resort and too often the 'last' resort. </COMMENT 11>

This is </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> To put it simply for you, WASH your Hands, and when you think that they are clean,  THEN wash them again. Maybe you will survive. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> As a Respiratory Therapist of 33 years, We also used etoh as a bronchial dilator which also broke the surfactent level   of the mucus bearer That made it possible to sucking the fluid out every 2 -3 hours. We called it or nick named it as a COPD  Cocktail.  Today the use of Peep and negative pressure on the newer Ventilators is simply outstanding. There is another form of life saving measures being carried out , and , that is Hyperbaric  ventilation. Used , for a wide variety of traumas  to the lung. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> They did this to my mother but still she was unable to survive the reason was ARDS due to COVID19. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Congratulations!
The video is very well made in that it gives so much detail and I enjoyed it thoroughly.  
I am not in the medical profession but I have an immense hunger for knowledge and research, to equip myself with the facts and because the video was so in detail it sent my mind on further research to make sure I understand all fully and that process is leading to a question.

I understand from the video that during “Covid-19” the interstitial fluid in the interstitial space becomes inflamed [03:43] and because of the inflammation in the interstitial space spontaneous diffusion between the oxygen in the alveoli and the capillary is strained or even not existent at all and therefore the need to be incubated with a ventilator so assist with breathing during ‘Covid-19”

My question is: 
If the inflammation present in interstitial space renders spontaneous diffusion between alveoli and the capillary impossible then it appears the situation will not be remedied by a ventilator because even if one tries to breath normally, use a CPAP, another device or a ventilator surely the blockage cause by the inflamed interstitial fluid is present in all cases which make spontaneous diffusion labored or not possible, and I don’t believe that a ventilator can clear up the inflammation in interstitial space to begin with.  Can you please elaborate on this.

thanks in advance

<COMMENT 1> may be it is karmic law working . ask yourself what have you done unright </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> do they do anything to stop the covid19 , it seems no </COMMENT 2>

<COMMENT 4> Wtf trump! You’re ruining your country </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Trump said it's only a kind of normal cold, no need to care. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> This is going to go on and on and on because the world didn’t have any common sense and didn’t take this seriously to begin with... instead fucking around with politicians and media spreading disease quicker than covid. The real criminals here are the politicians, media. Is there any penalties for them allowing the spread of this disease as it would of been easy to control if you just closed travel for a while & let China deal with it. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> America- home of the dumbest people on the planet! </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Did you know that according to a 2004 report authored by multiple medical doctors (entitled “Death by Medicine”), the total number of deaths caused by conventional medicine is an astounding 783,936 per year? 
  
In other words, more people in the USA die EACH YEAR from “iatrogenic” (i.e. doctor induced) causes than died in the ENTIRE Civil War! I don’t worry about the C-19, I worry more about Dr’s and the drugs they push. </COMMENT 8>

<COMMENT 18> Only 100 death in Australia -Trumps arrogance at the start was the cause of this. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> It is obvious the US is not interested in controlling the COVID 19.  A “first world “ country like the US should have had this under control months ago. </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 13> Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah has been ranked among "the world’s top doctors” by a Chinese TV station for his strategies in tackling the Covid-19 pandemic.

China Global TV Network (CGTN) said Malaysia’s Health director-general was one of the three leading doctors in the fight to curb the spread of the Covid-19 virus worldwide, along with the US government’s infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci and New Zealand’s director-general of health Ashley Bloomfield. </COMMENT 13>

Remember the further away you can stand from someone, the harder it is to confer that this is a government psychological operation with covert19 via socialist distancing, via socialist engineering.

 1. Tome la Vit C-1000.
  2. Vitamina E.
  3. 10:00 - 11:00 luz solar durante 15-20 minutos. 4. Huevo una comida.
  5. Descanso / 7-8 horas.
  6. Beba 1.5 L de agua por día y cada comida debe estar tibia (no fría).
  Esto es lo que hacemos en el hospital.

  Esto es para decirnos a todos que el pH varía de 5.5 a 8.5 para el virus coronario.
  Para vencer al virus coronario, necesitamos consumir más alimentos alcalinos por encima del pH del virus.

  Algunos de ellos son:
  * Limón - 9.9 pH.
  * Lima - 8.2 pH.
  * Aguacate - 15.6 pH.
  * Ajo - pH 13.2
  * Mango - 8.7pH.
  * Mandarina - 8.5pH.
  * Piña - 12.7 pH.
  * Diente de león - 22.7 pH.
  * Naranja - 9.2 pH.

  ¿Cómo sabías que tenías un coronavirus?
  1. Picazón en la garganta.
  2. Garganta seca.
  3. Tos seca.
  4. Alta temperatura.
  5. Falta de aliento.
  6. Pérdida de olfato y sabor.

  Entonces, cuando preste atención a estos, obtenga rápidamente agua tibia y beba con limón. Y usar mascara siempre . mantener la distancias con las personas por lo memos 1 - 2 metros de distancia a las  otra persona.

<COMMENT 3> EASY WAY TO GET RID OF HIV WITHIN 12 DAYS DAYS 

i want to use this opportunity to testify on  how i got cured from HIV,  HIV is known not to have a cure, i have this virus since 2010, i have done all my best to get cured from this disease but non could avail until a friend of mine told me about doctor oosa herbal home on the internet who helps people cure any type of diseases including HIV AIDS, cancer, Herpes etc, at first i doubt  if it was real but decided to give it a try, when i contacted Dr OOSA he helped me with his herbal medicine which i used and i got cured within 2 weeks.i went for a medical checkup and my doctor confirmed it that i am negative  HIV. the main reason why i share this testimony is to tell the whole world that HIV is real and the cure is also real.if you have HIV and you lost your hope doctor oosa is the right herbal doctor to contact. Contact this great herbal doctor for any kind of disease or ailment via this email doctoroosaherbalhome@gmail.com  whatsapp +359878394269 </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Guess what might be effective against a 🦇 virus? 🧄&🧅 (🧛‍♂️😉😁)  🧄&🧅 are great sources for sulphor, will induce glutathione production (as NAC does), are antiviral and blood-thinning, and if you eat too much, 🧄&🧅 will have the same side effects as NAC (🤮). Raw 🧅 are a good quercetin source, and 🧅 quercetin has a better bioavailability than quercetin from supplements (later only about 1%). Therefore, 1/2 a raw 🧅/day + zinc might be a cheap 2-in-1 way for COVID-19 prophylaxis. Add ginger, black pepper and tumeric as further antioxidants. If you are drinking and/or smoking, or take other poison, glutathione in the liver will be used for detox. </COMMENT 4>

Stay healthy with a strong immune system so the body can be the miracle it's meant to be!!!  Stay healthy out there. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> NAC is also freaking cheap </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Thanks once again. I've come back to this video to re learn the studies on NAC. It took weeks to find a sorce of NAC. When it was delivered I had forgotten most of the data. I am now taking 500mg per. day, just as a prophylactic. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> I can’t tell you how much I respect your brilliant analysis, your clarity, your intense focus on understanding covid’s mechanisms in the body, and your devotion to saving the lives of people you will never even meet. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> NAC was the first thing i thought of. It helped me to achieve remission from severe depression/anxiety and i generally react well to antioxidants, when it comes to my mood issues and chronic pain. Thus, when i heard of cytokine storm... But i am only a layman. 🤷 </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Excellent teaching. Have added/embedded this video at www.NACinCOVID.info (www.NACinCOVID.net). We're setting up a clinical trial using NAC in COVID at Cambridge Health Alliance (@challiance). @BostonTox @mlaib </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Hi Roger, check this paper out, maybe: 2019 Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19): Paving the Road for Rapid Detection and Point-of-Care Diagnostics. https://www.mdpi.com/2072-666X/11/3/306 </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> What would happen if i took glutathione and NAC together at the same time? </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> My favorite doctor </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> I came across this interesting article summarizing a number of studies on both oxidative stress, but also the use of NAC supplementation to address psychiatric issues- bipolar, obsessive compulsive, substance abuse. See here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3036554/ </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> I'M 78,BUT I HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH THAT I HAD AMOST FORGOTTEN FROM MY PAST EDUCATION.YOU'RE THE BEST ILLUSTRATOR FOR THIS SUBJECT AND I WATCH ONLY YOUR VIDEOS.I ALSO ADMIRE YOUR SPIRITUAL COMMITMENTS AND I FELT LIKE THE 1st TIME I LISTENED I KNEW THAT YOU WERE HONEST,DEDICATED,AND A PROMOTER OF TRUTH.I WILL CONTINUE TO BE A BELIEVER IN YOUR PROTOCOL.I'M A VERY HIGH RISK HAVING HAD SEPIS 3 TIMES AND PNEUMONIA 3 TIMES;ONCE BI-LATERAL.GOD BE BLESSED FOR MY SURVIVAL.YOU ARE MY MEDICAL HERO ~KEEP UP THE WONDERFUL WORK ! </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Can I safely ake NAC like Vitamin D on daily basis?, and is it ok to take if Iam taking a daily dose of aspirin 82 mg? </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Thank you doc, I’m 65 years old, and I take NAC,Vitamin D3,Vitamin C and Zinc everyday. And I eat as healthy as possible gets lots of exercise and plenty of sunlight and fresh air.And I’ve tried to share this information with my family and friends, but they look at me like I’m crazy and say stuff like you’re not a doctor.. and if that’s true why don’t they mention it on the news or the medical industry haven’t approved it... yet they are all getting sick by not listening... I will try to share this link of your studies with them , maybe they would listen to you.... but I want to thank you so much for this information.... you are a blessing to us all❤️👍💯. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Awsome! Especially important for those of blood type A! </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Hello there! What about the tablet that is being dissolved in water? Is that the same? </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> I had never heard of NAC before Dr Sehault. My mother has been suffering from Avian Tuberculosis for many years. In my google search on NAC I found it looks like it could also be a very promising treatment for her. Thank you doctor!!!!!.. Her husband is an epidemiologist professor and had not seen this. He was elated to learn this and she is now taking NAC . FWIW, this is the name of the paper:

<COMMENT 1> I work for a hospital, I’m working from home due to covid19, anyone healthy are working from home, so i hear about the seriousness of this from work, I have a daughter, she and her husband understand the seriousness, are following the cdc guidelines, they have a son with an autoimmune disease, my son and his wife think this is a hoax, they don’t wear masks, they gather with my daughter in law’s family, so i look like weird Grandma...I’ve thrown myself into sewing and gardening, I don’t know how to navigate between these two worlds, today I’m feeling beyond overwhelmed, I’m crying from all the pent up distress, </COMMENT 1>

<COMMENT 4> I hate this so much, i’am a 14 y.o and last half year/8 month’s I’ve started to go back into society and not sitting all day in home. Since January/februari I’ve overwon my depression. But this quarantine has been killing me fr. atm I feel so lonely and feel like I have 2 good friends left :/ </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Whenever I am feeling stressed out by the Coronavirus, I just play some Three Beat Slide music and my anxiety disappears...It's like some kind of magical drug that makes me feel happy again </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> I've actually improved in my mental health because of covid-19, I don't like to leave my house and have seen a therapist through video why otherwise I would have bailed. Anyone else? </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> This very important video lesson and should be given in the beginning of COVID-19. Thanks, though it given at this time. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Good to know </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> What could help America's mental well this is to get all the information that is wrong off of the TVs the radios and YouTube about the covid-19 we are pounded with it as a daily dose how many people died do this do that the only ones we should be listening to is scientists that know what they are talking about don't watch the news don't watch the talk shows anybody that's talking about covid-19 ignore it unless they're telling you there is a cure I have been doing that I've been staying home I wear a mask when I go to the store to get groceries other than that I stay at home which I have been doing all along enjoy your day don't listen to the news they just stress you out more thank the media add information </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Great presentation </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> I have been so stressed out that for the first time in my entire life i have skipped my period! I am a fully grown woman well into adulthood but not quite close to the change yet. I have all of my usual PMS symptoms,  horrible cramps and that dreadful hormonal change that makes my head spin and feel horrible but no period. My cycles are like clock work. They NEVER skip... anytime i thought it would not come it always popped up by night fall or early small hours but not this time. This is how stressed ive been. And NO i am  NOT pregnant.. unless you believe in the 2nd coming of Jesus </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> At t=6:38 he talks about one thing that is really helpful - that is to connect and reconnect with your core social support network (spouse, siblings, children, closest friends), and contact them over the phone or over social media. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> You also didn't mention the huge chance of contracting other diseases while in a hospital. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Take control of and take care of your brain to improve your mental health. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> This is a great video. Very informative and so relevant. Thank you very much. </COMMENT 15>

<COMMENT 19> I am having nonstop panic attacks im going crazy my world is blocked im nonstop state of fear i can't sleep or eat i have no idea how long can i continue like this l😔 </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> I overcame my anxiety by reading Said Nursi's book: "Message For The Sick".
I definitely recommend it to everyone. 
   "O sick person who worries unnecessarily! You worry at the severity of your illness and that worry increases it. If you want your illness to be less severe, try not to worry. That is, think of the benefits of your illness, the recompense for it, and that it will pass quickly; it will remove the worry and cut the illness at the root. Indeed, worry increases illness twice over. Worry causes an immaterial illness of the heart beneath the physical illness; the physical illness rests on that and persists. If the worry ceases through submission, contentment, and thinking of the wisdom in the illness, an important part of the illness is extirpated; it becomes lighter and in part disappears. "

Sure maybe it's true about the phosphates , also the bad blood about wolfs declaration in space co operation laws, best interpreted by China itself and whatever natural laws which can be observed and sequence tamed by any method. Prototype proto's of course may fail like herd trace or transmission measures. Probably science fiction like bad anti communist's needing a neutral behaviour modifier in the Hong Kong provinces too. It will be legendary many people can't understand and want to blame it on something like nationality. </COMMENT 10>

<COMMENT 16> Keep hacking in the global government research centers you thife's will find some data some were lmfao </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Sure!!!!they made vaccine before they made THE VIRUS.😡😡😡 </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Be careful of hostile countries that are out to thwart China's efforts in developing a  vaccine, do not go to the US, UK, Australia, Canada or some other western countries that may sabotage and smear China's image. E. G face masks and other medical equipment , instead of being thankful and cooperating, they blame China. 
Should work with other friendly nations first. Should start with Asian countries like Thailand, Singapore, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Japan, etc, etc,  to help contain the pandemic in Asia first then move on to Africa and Latin America. 
Last are those hostile nations, let them rot in this pandemic . </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Who wants anything from China? No one trusts China anymore. Even if you give for free, no one wants it. If you are such an expert specialist, why could you not confine CCP virus to Wuhan only. Big talkers with small brains & no grey matter. Go eat snakes, bats & pangolins! </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 2> such a great video, with clear and detailed explanations. thank you so much for making this!! </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Peer reviewed scientific papers please that prove a Sars Cov-2 virus HAS BEEN isolated in its pure form and that Koch's postulates and the Gold Standard have been met?
There isn't one is there?! So what are they testing for, what are they diagnosing and what EXACTLY are they using to manufacture the vaccine and what is it for?! </COMMENT 3>

<COMMENT 1> i thot you gonna talk about Bill Gates vaccine , 666 chips, etc. this is the number one most popular HOAX in the world. not just in the US </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Professor Dave, this is a serious question, how do we know we’re safe?
The latest WHO numbers have the known cases to know deaths now below 1% (.6% last I saw) and that should go even lower as more cases are discovered.
When this 1st began and it was at 3%, they speculated it could be below 1%, but just in case, we need to quarantine in case the fatality rate really is 3%.
The CDC numbers have fatalities plummeting the last few weeks, since many places have begun opening back up again(which have included large groups gathering, within 6 feet of each other on beaches, without masks, probably transmitting things not called COVID-19).
So the fall in numbers aren’t correlated to beginning a quarantine.

Every piece of media I see, still seems to be fear mongering.
It’s “a new normal”.
It’s “there could be a 2nd wave”.
It’s “no one can ever gather in groups, within 6 feet of each other, ever again”
It’s “we have to play sporting events without fans” (never mind the large numbers of protesters gathered together)
It’s “we can’t have students attending actual classes or living in dorms”

I’ve even heard major new sources suggest “CDC numbers are too low & fraudulent”
That sounds like conspiratorial thinking?
We may never have a COVID-19 vaccination.
If we have one, there’s always another pandemic around the corner and we’ve always managed in the past to get through it with less knowledge and without destroying our way of life.

At what point do we just go back to not living in fear and isolation?
The “experts” I hear in the media sound like they want everyone to live in fear and isolation for the foreseeable future.
People are losing jobs, and having tons of people in homeless shelters, will probably spread the disease faster than being at work 8 hours a day.

Do we still think millions will die, if people stop the quarantine tomorrow and get back to living life?
I don’t think the data bears that out.

Who will tell us we’re safe?
How will they know?
There is risk to everything, what is the acceptable level, & can someone tell me what exactly that is.
If we thought about the 1.35 million people who die on roads every year, would we want to drive?
I want the legitimate truth, does anyone have a clue? </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> https://drive.google.com/file/d/19CbWmdGTnnW1iZ9pxlxq1ssAdYl3Eur3/view  

I found this is two seconds.   Several studies, peer reviewed that show clear and present danger.   Some countries do not allow wifi in schools and it's not because they are uninformed. 

Don't be fooled by this guy, there are A LOT of scientists concerned about the level of radiation we are exposing ourselves to.    Here's a excerpt from Scientific American:

"The World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified RFR as "possibly carcinogenic to humans" in 2011. Last year, a $30 million study conducted by the U.S. National Toxicology Program (NTP) found “clear evidence” that two years of exposure to cell phone RFR increased cancer in male rats and damaged DNA in rats and mice of both sexes. The Ramazzini Institute in Italy replicated the key finding of the NTP using a different carrier frequency and much weaker exposure to cell phone radiation over the life of the rats." 

  And that's just cell phones.  Imagine what a tower pulsing crazy numbers is doing.   I'm not saying it's the cause of Coronoa, not at all,  but there is for sure evidence that it might be harmful.  And this guy is wrong about 5G not being new...it's been around but not networked nationwide, which is what they've been turning on the past couple years.  He sounds like he's reading PR from Verizon's website or something.

Go ahead and click and read the some of the 200 stuidies I linked to and get back to me if you aren't seeing a pattern of potential risk to humans.    This guy just dropped in credibility a lot for me. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> do you have keyboards on the keyboard? </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Conspiracy followers are quite likely to write-off any contradictory evidence, by claiming that the contradictory evidence is part of the conspiracy.  Indeed, people have genuinely written-off all evidence that contradicts the notion that COVID 19 is a conspiracy, by calling that contradictory evidence a conspiracy.  Covering all bases, the conspiracy people have declared COVID 19 to be a conspiracy because it does exist, or a conspiracy because it doesn't exist.  In other words, the virus was created by the Illuminati/NWO/Bill Gates/1984 Big Brother/Chinese/US Government/Spherical Earth scientists, in order to control all of humanity, at the same time as being a hoax by the Illuminati/NWO/Bill Gates/1984 Big Brother/Chinese/US Government/Spherical Earth scientists. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> While I was awaiting your reply I did some research of my own and it turns out my immune system will take care of the virus in a few days just like the thousands of people who had it and survived.. So why exactly should one imprison ones self when  the symptoms are mild and the cure inside us all..hmmm? </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Typhoid Mary had an excuse, these idiots today don't have one, and I mean stupid people who refuse to wear masks to prevent the spread. Asymptomatic individuals who have no symptoms but are carriers. I wear a kiosk respirator to protect me and my elderly parents from these people. The next extinction event will be caused by stupidity not a natural disaster, not to say that stupidity is'nt a natural disaster. It is. Ignorance is excusable, stupidity is not. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Interesting. Take a bunch of insane and stupid conspiracy theories like the viruses don’t exist and 5G nonsense and combine them with the investigation of the origin which raises super legit questions. Is it to discredit the very legitimate argument on the origin? </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> I don’t know about you, but I’m a ginger and I destroyed COVID (probably, I was sick for a while at the start of the Corona craze and I felt like I was going to die.) </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> All but the fourth are insane junk of course. But on the 4th, not buying it. First, people cannot manufacture viruses. Let’s get that out of the way. Nobody is saying that.  What we are saying is that there is very high likelihood that this came form the virology lab in Wuhan (which is run by the PLA by the way). The most innocuous explanation is an accident. Accidental release of a virus they were researching. However, another scenario is they were conducting biological weapons research and experimenting with viruses that can attach to humans easily. Again accidental release. I give that a lower probability and a Nature article makes a plausible and convincing case against it.  But leaves several questions. The spike S protein is perfectly adapted to a human host. In fact, based on other research from Australia, this S glycoprotein binds to humans better than it binds in any other animal host. That part is very odd and such mutation in an intermediate animal host seems hard to believe. On the other hand, developing these mutations while in human hosts means that it had to be circulating for a while in humans (well before November and remember this is a slow mutating virus) but there is no evidence of that. This is very odd. Why I think lab experimentation (creation of Chimera viruses) is at least a plausible explanation. Perhaps a low probability but is plausible. This kind of research is nothing new, the Soviets used to conduct such experiments. At some point they tried to combine the DNA from Venezuelan equine encephalitis, smallpox (super contagious) and Ebola viruses (back in the 80’s). It was called the Chimera Project. The Chinese want to dominate the world and show their scientific excellence. 

Bottomline, don’t listen to what the Chinese say. Pay attention to what they do. The mad cover up and the lies. Why would they go to such extend to cover up if it was from an animal market? Also, if it was truly from the wet animal market why would they open them back up so fast? Makes little sense. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> 🚗 car accidents, strokes, ❤️ heart attacks, cancer, smoking/vaping plane crashes and on and on! Do we shut down the world bcuz of the few things I mentioned? </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> "People don't get paid to study things that don't exist"

Then what about theologians? :P </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> vinesauce vinny </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> It isn't that virus's don't exist it's actually part of your body makeup. There are other medical studies other than what you are taught. 

“There is a principle which is a bar against all information, which is proof against all arguments, and which cannot fail to keep a man in everlasting ignorance - that principle is contempt prior to investigation.” </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Your channel is like a lighthouse in an ocean of stupidity. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> I thought I was commenting on the flat earth video but this one started right after so it posted here. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> I'm on board 100% with your take on flat earth theory, but if you're convinced that this is all coincidence and that a pandemic is actually what we're in the midst of, then you're suffering from the exact same type of delusion that the flat earth people are... Apparently sane, very intelligent, and able to reason on many levels... But a particular aspect of the bigger picture eludes you. This is indeed part of something carefully planned, with mandatory vaccines, a one world government, a cashless lower class, and a ruling elite at the top of it all well under way in the line up. If you can't see it, I highly recommend some LSD. I promise, if you've never tried it your perspective will change forever. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Wait, legit question. Prof Dave says "...increasing transmission rates and thereby increasing deaths." Or something to that effect. I was under the impression that social distancing was in order to slow down infections to decrease burden on healthcare system, and that total deaths would.be approx the same. So which is it, is isolating decreasing overall deaths or is it just slowing the rate those deaths come in? That's a big difference and could change my opinion on staying locked down or not </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> In a future video can you hang the cloth on the ironing board/long skinny table or add a link to a full view, it looks very interesting! </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Hi yes there are lots of people getting things wrong. But the biggest wrong is the cause of this pandemic. Scientists are to blame for this outbreak and many earlier outbreaks by every advanced nation. It is ironic that by and large it is the advanced nations that are least able to defend themselves while countries with less infrastructure are often spectacularly successful. USA has suffered more than most countries while countries with huge populations despite the best efforts of USA have still to get one death. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 4> <COVID-19 TRUTH>
*Most people won’t get the virus.*
*Most of the people who get it won’t display symptoms.*
*Most of the people who display symptoms will only be mildly sick.*
*Most of the people with severe symptoms will never be critically ill.*
*And most of the people who get critically ill will survive.*

This is borne out by the numerous serological studies which show, again and again, that the infection fatality ratio is on par with flu.
( https://swprs.org/studies-on-covid-19-lethality/ )
There is no science – and increasingly little rational discussion – to justify the lockdown measures and overall sense of global panic.
Nevertheless, it’s always good to get official acknowledgement of the truth, even if it has to be leaked.
Here are three leaks showing that those in power know that the coronavirus poses no threat, and in no way justifies the lockdown that is going to destroy the livelihoods of so many.
1. “IT’S ALL BULLSHIT!”
On May 26th Dr Alexander Myasnikov, Russia’s head of coronavirus information, gave an interview to former-Presidential candidate Ksenia Sobchak in which he apparently let slip his true feelings.
( https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/05/27/its-all-bullsht-russias-coronavirus-information-chief-says-of-virus-fears-a70398 )
Believing the interview over, and the camera turned off, Myasnikov said:
It’s all bullshit […] It’s all exaggerated. It’s an acute respiratory disease with minimal mortality […] Why has the whole world been destroyed? That I don’t know,”

<COMMENT 2> That's because it was in the flu vaccine that's why people a false positive just like it was in one of the vaccines that gave people HIV </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> I´ll do 250 antibody testes to my employees. I think the prevalence of my city is under 5%. In this case, is this tests useless ? </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> I have read studies on the affect of N-acetyl cysteine in relationship to pulmonary hypertension. The studies have contradicted themselves, with some showing (in rats) that it increases PH, while in others it is suggested that NAC may be a treatment for PH.

I am currently supplementing with NAC and have hypertension. I started on this supplementation after viewing your videos on COVID 19. 

Could you please clarify this NAC PH connection? Perhaps you can address this in one of your videos. 

Thank you very much. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> We have antibody tests with 100% specificity, FDA approved already, why are we still using tests with lower accuracy? https://www.bing.com/search?q=fda+antibody+test+100%25+specificity&pc=U316&form=CHRDEF&sp=-1&pq=fda+antibody+test+100%25+specificity&sc=0-34&qs=n&sk=&cvid=E488113C901C4DCB9556528512114119 </COMMENT 5>

<COMMENT 8> The thing is. Fiction,Time and so much more  is made up by humans. How do we not know that every thought we think and make up new creatures and world's. They say our brains are like coumputers. How do we not know that everything we think. Like what we imagine is created from a data base inside our brain. That would mean that we have knowledge or every plant,star,and life form in the universe and maybe we haven't woke up to our true ability yet. That's why when we make movies,books,and video games, those things are really real just on another planet (maybe)  and we are starting to wake up . When we are able to see inside our conscience (dreams when we sleep) see this knowledge and learn how to tap into out inner knowledge in our brains. That's why some books movies tv shows really come true because we are able to predict our future we just dont realize it or understand how to use it.
Just some ideas that I had today and needed to share with everyone! </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> I just took a Blue Horizon test from UK 100% sensitive and 99.63% specific. So I'm pretty confident it will be correct. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Why are there false positives? What is the Covid antibody test reacting to? Prior colds or flu? </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> God bless you doc </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> What if the prevalence in a workplace is very high, and a person wants to be tested, shouldn’t this be the figure used in computing true positives and negatives, rather than the prevalence in the population as a whole? </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Small quibble:  If 100 people have the disease and the prevalence is 5%, then those free of the disease number 1900, not 2000. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Thank you! I never fully understood this concept until watching this video </COMMENT 14>

<COMMENT 16> FALSE POSITIVES - INFLATED CASE NUMBERS - Dr Deborah Birx warned long ago and CDC have just now finally admitted it too!
"If you have 1% of the population infected and you have a test that is only
 99% specific, then if you find a positive, then 50% of time it will be a
 real positive and 50% of time it won't be! [ie, it will be a false 
positive]".

<COMMENT 17> Thank you.  I've seen every video on COVID-19 and have learned so much.  In today's video, I'm shocked and saddened to hear that Ford is going to contribute so much more air pollution (and noise pollution) in their Police SUVs that will rev high for 15 minutes to reach 133 degrees.  That's going to damage a lot of lung in a lot of people.   See:   Dr. John Campbell's video of today on Air Pollution's effect regarding well, anyone's lungs anytime, but also specifically re. to  COVID-19

<COMMENT 18> Have you or others put into clinical practice testing and determining the ratio between glutathione and measures of oxidative stress to help determine COVID 19 outcomes and whether anti-oxidant supplements work?  If so what clinical labs are doing accurate tests of these determinants? </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Fantastic explanation and demonstration! </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 12> They said it's most effective for mild cases and did not state the death rate. IN THE MEANTIME, AN AMERICAN DOCTOR HAS CURED ALL CASES OF COVID-19. DR. THOMAS YADEGAR, HAS DEVELOPED A MEDICAL BREAKTHROUGH IN THE TREATMENT OF COVID-19 BY DEMONSTRATING A 100% CURE RATE OF HIS PATIENTS AND WITHOUT HAVING TO LEAVE PATIENTS ON RESPIRATORS. DR. YADEGAR IS THE ICU DIRECTOR AT PROVIDENCE CEDARS-SINAI TARZANA MEDICAL CENTER IN CALIFORNIA WITH 20 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE AS A PRACTICING PHYSICIAN. DUE TO HIS SUCCESS WITH COVID-19, HE NOW SUPERVISES TREATMENTS FOR PATIENTS AT 6 HOSPITALS REGIONALLY. NBC TV NEWS IN CALIFORNIA REPORTED HIS CURE, APRIL 1, 2020. A TRANSCRIPT OF A INTERVIEW WITH DR. YADEGAR, IN WHICH HE SUMMARISES HIS CURE, IS ONLINE AT THE NEWS SECTION FOR THE NEWS OF APRIL 28, 2020 ON THE GLENN BECK RADIO SHOW WEBSITE. IN THE US, IT IS OFTEN SAID IN THE NEWS THAT UP TO 80%, OR MORE, OF THE COVID-19 PATIENTS PLACED ON RESPIRATORS DIE. TO COUNTERACT THIS, DR. YADEGAR DEVELOPED A MEDICAL TOOL, A DIAGNOSTIC PANEL OF CLINICAL "MARKERS" TO ENABLE HIM TO PREDETERMINE WHICH COVID-19 PATIENTS WOULD NORMALLY REQUIRE RESPIRATOR TREATMENTS AND HE AGGRESSIVELY INTERVENED BY TREATING THEM WITH IMMUNOSUPPRESSANTS TO PREVENT CYTOKINE STORM SYNDROME. AND, HE ALSO GAVE PATIENTS AN ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUG TO CONTROL WIDESPREAD INFLAMMATION. MORE DETAILS ARE AVAILABLE ON THE PROVIDENCE CEDARS-SINAI TARZANA MEDICAL CENTER WEBSITE, OR BY CALLING DR. YADEGAR. </COMMENT 12>

<COMMENT 1> Hello, sir.

Let me introduce myself, I'm Ferry, from Bogor, Indonesia.

Just sharing info. That in Indonesia, our small team, named Milagros, has given milagros water donations to hospitals that treat positive patients.

And the result, just by drinking Milagros water, recovery from covid19, is very perfect.

In our data, it has been noted that Milagros water is able to fight covid19. Also other health problems.

What I'm focusing on is that in Indonesia there is no need for a vaccine. We just take Milagros, corona can be overcome.

Right now, what your country does not have, but in my country is very abundant, is Milagros water.

Which is clearly proven to be able to cure positive patients covid19 to completion.

And it's proven, some of our small teams don't need an anti-covid vaccine. Just drinking milagros, it's resolved.

If you want to know more about Milagros water, you can contact my Whatsapp number at +6285925081694 </COMMENT 1>

<COMMENT 4> This virus came from the lab in Wuhan not from animals. This virus is not a limited geographical virus, if it were a limited geographical virus it would have stayed in Wuhan but it did not. IMO I think they were experimenting with this virus in the lab and it got out of hand and it got away from them. Hence the pandemic. </COMMENT 4>

<COMMENT 7> Does corona die with hot water, every day drink 2 times </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> W.H.O is nothing for us,they only listen to CCP only,no more sympathy to them😠 </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> “Illnesses range from mild to severe and even death. Hospitalization and death occur mainly among high risk groups. Worldwide, these annual epidemics are estimated to result in about 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness, and about 290 000 to 650 000 respiratory deaths”. This paragraph was taken straight from a WHO site. Anyone reading it might imagine it refers to Covid-19 but no, it refers to the average worldwide annual influenza infections. The figures of up to 5 million infections and 650,000 deaths means a death rate of up to 13% of those infected. As I write this, Covid-19 has infected 5,933,622 people and 362,629 have died, representing a death rate of those infected of approx. 6.1%. So far, the death rate for Covid-19 is approximately half that of influenza. Why then have all the world’s governments reacted to Covid-19 with extreme measures which have resulted in severe economic consequences for generations to come? </COMMENT 9>

<COMMENT 1> Even after this is done, whenever someone sneezes the first word that will come to our heads will be coronavirus😂 </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> The Vaccines 💉 with RNA Substances are most dangerous !!! </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Do you people realize it takes years to create a safe vaccine. If not you are welcome to have my injection. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Is the vaccine available in September </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Good luck scientists  do your best on getting that vacine going this month have it ready this month once again good luck </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> It’s vaccine dummy not vaxin . And what show do you have that you are welcoming someone to your show . </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Amazing news </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> PABALA
Panunuhol ay umiiral na ngaun sa mga companies at sa Media para ma isagawa na ang pang kalahatan bakuna.

May dalawang component itong future vaccine na hnd pa tinutukoy secret pa. Pero ang pangatlo ay ang " SQUALENE ".

COVID 19 =means Certificate Of Vaccination Identity with 19, 1=A 9=I for AI= Artificial Intelligence

Hindi pala ito pangalan ng virus, kung hindi itoy International plan para ma control at hnd dumami o lumaki ang population. At na developed na ito mga 10 year o mahigit pa. Na ilunsad na ito last January 2020 during the last DAVOS.
DONT GET TRACK
(wag tau sumunod)
pag katapos ng 70 days, ang virus na ito ay hnd na active, kaya nalalampasan natin ito. Kaya naman nag reactivates ang virus na ito, kasi humina ang immune natin sa bakuna.
Ang plano talaga nila i inject sa atin (7 more terrible vaccines) totoong ibabana o ihuhulog tayo pa puntang impierno.

Ang target nila, madaming mababawas na tao, mahigit 80% ang ma papasama.

Ito naman 5G na na install sa mga cities sa buong mundo, ay para sa ganun humina ang atin immune defense. Kaya wag talaga mag pa test hindi ito segurado o ligtas.

Ang mga manufacturer o gumagawa ng test na ito ay nag sasabi, na hnd ma detect ang SRaS_COV_2 virus na ito. Kung hindi ang walang katapusan na maliliit ma virus o wastes cell lamang na nasa microbiata natin, kaya ang result o lumalabas, madami ang positibo pero hnd nila matukoy ang covid virus mismo.

Kaya ito ang objective nila:
Ang reason ngaun, una ilabas ang mga bata, kasi hnd nila ma impose ang test sa mga matatanda.

Sa kabila nito, last May 11 sa France, nag karoon ng mass screening da lahat ng school(700thousand/per week).
Kaya naman bawat School Director ay may pahintulot galing sa Rectorate para sa ganun  ma impose o ma obliga ang test sa mga bata. Kahit walang pahintulot sa magulang o wala manlang pasabi.

Once na ang bata na screened, saka lang tatawagin ang immediate family para mag pa screened test din. Obligado ka tanggapin ang screening. Kasi kung ayaw mo, an anak mo ay aalisin o tatanggalin sa naturang school. Yan ang mangyayari at itoy ay Order ng School.

Tayo walang sakit, tayo ay healthy carriers, carriers lang tayo sa maliliit o little viruses lamamg yan ang laging lumalabas sa mga test....as positive.
Lahat sila kailangan ganito:
Paniwalain na ang buong mundo. Na ang mundo natin ay may sakit. " MAKE THE WHOLE WORLD BELIEVE THAT THE WORLD IS SICK".

Kapag naging positive sa test ay matutukoy na isa kang panganib, tulad ng mga Hudyo.
Ang pag tanggi sa screening ay siyang susi para mas maiwasan natin ang pag tatalaga ng bakuna sa atin (wave 2), kapag hindi tumaas ang bilang, ay mas hindi sila papayagan na italaga ang bakuna sa 7 bilyon katao....

Sa oras na nabakunahan  labat tayo ay magkakasaki at manghihina.....at alam nyo ma ang kasunod...
Sa France, ang mga tao doon ay tumatanggi sa screening, at ang dahilan, the only messege is maintindihan ito ng buong Social Network and in France is the ff:
_during 9 days we shld only talk about that,
_close your book, videos that deal with secondary subjects.

At ang last messege to get across during those 9 days.
_ huwag sumunod, at wag payagan ang mga bata sumunod na walang pahintulot ng magulang.

Sa France, ang mensahe ay na iintindihan ng mga mamamayan doon, na hnd nila pababalikin ang mga bata sa School. Pagitan ng mga estado, na may mga critical situation. Ayaw nila may mass screened at hnd sila obligado sa second wave to be vaccinated o bakunahan. Ang mahalagang solution, iligtas ang isang katauhan and to make people understand that they should not be tested.
Huwag mag pa test
Huwag ibigay sa kanila kung ano ang wala sila
Huwag kang mahulog sa trap.
Everything will flow from there;
1. Hindi ka mag papahuli
2. Hindi ka mag papa test
3. Hindi ka mag papa bakuna

We must fill the walls of face book, videos, all media spaces with this unique messege.

More clear panels!
Their point of attacks; our children.
Str

Their strategy:
_ a screening
_ do not give what they lack
_ at least you cannot say that you have not been warned

Ipa mahagi ito sa lahat hangat maaari sa lalong madaling panahon, hangat maaari kasi ang proseso nitoy ay parating na.

oh my God Hide us in your pavillion, save us Lord.

<COMMENT 10> Most of us have already been exposed and probably have not just antigens but t cells from previous coronaviruses we've fought off.  Vitamin C, D and zinc and good nutrition will fight off covid.  I know this first hand because I have family at the front line working in health directly with covid patients on a daily basis and they have never caught covid when other colleagues have.  The only difference was my family mega dosed with Vit C, D and zinc.  It works and could have stopped this virus from getting out of hand if only more doctors implemented this as a treatment.  High dose IV vit C was used in China and all people in the trial recovered.  Even those who were declining quickly.  Also they couldn't find a vaccine for Sars 1, the ferrets they used all produced cytokine storms when exposed to the live virus.  Moderna's current human trials have already produced serious effects in the test subjects.  One guy passed out, had a high fever and was vomiting and he was young and healthy.  Now imagine giving that to your elderly grandparents, would be disasterous.  Do your own research.  When Moderna shares spike by 40% with the "promising" results from the trials this far why would the Chief Medical Officer sell off ALL of his shares unless he knows something we don't.  If you had shares in Apple or Facebook and your company went up by 40% overnight, you would sell some and keep some shares, not sell 100% of them.  These are the things we need to look out for.  Find out for yourselves.  Don't just take the vaccine for the sake of it.  Most people are asymptomatic because of the t cells they already have ready to go.  You are the solution to this problem.  Trust your immune systems, they are brilliant and no vaccine can ever replace that. </COMMENT 10>

<COMMENT 12> Although Belize doesn't have covid 19 i wish for the vaccine of the covid 19. </COMMENT 12>

When the chips are down, only Jesus saves.

When your friends hurt and hurt and hurt, remember Jesus.

When that boyfriend disappoint, Jesus will never disappoint.

When you are too strong, rich, beautiful and successful, remember Jesus.

No one will live forever. Hold some space in your heart for Jesus and If you don't have love, you dont have Jesus. Fullstop. </COMMENT 16>

<COMMENT 1> Hello, sir.

Let me introduce myself, I'm Ferry, from Bogor, Indonesia.

Just sharing info. That in Indonesia, our small team, named Milagros, has given milagros water donations to hospitals that treat positive patients.

And the result, just by drinking Milagros water, recovery from covid19, is very perfect.

In our data, it has been noted that Milagros water is able to fight covid19. Also other health problems.

What I'm focusing on is that in Indonesia there is no need for a vaccine. We just take Milagros, corona can be overcome.

Right now, what your country does not have, but in my country is very abundant, is Milagros water.

Which is clearly proven to be able to cure positive patients covid19 to completion.

And it's proven, some of our small teams don't need an anti-covid vaccine. Just drinking milagros, it's resolved.

If you want to know more about Milagros water, you can contact my Whatsapp number at +6285925081694 </COMMENT 1>

IMO I think they were experimenting with this virus in the lab and it got out of hand and it got away from them. Hence the pandemic. </COMMENT 4>

<COMMENT 8> W.H.O is nothing for us,they only listen to CCP only,no more sympathy to them😠 </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> “Illnesses range from mild to severe and even death. Hospitalization and death occur mainly among high risk groups. Worldwide, these annual epidemics are estimated to result in about 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness, and about 290 000 to 650 000 respiratory deaths”. This paragraph was taken straight from a WHO site. Anyone reading it might imagine it refers to Covid-19 but no, it refers to the average worldwide annual influenza infections. The figures of up to 5 million infections and 650,000 deaths means a death rate of up to 13% of those infected. As I write this, Covid-19 has infected 5,933,622 people and 362,629 have died, representing a death rate of those infected of approx. 6.1%. So far, the death rate for Covid-19 is approximately half that of influenza. Why then have all the world’s governments reacted to Covid-19 with extreme measures which have resulted in severe economic consequences for generations to come? </COMMENT 9>

<COMMENT 1> Probably just lying to the country to keep us under lockdown for longer and destroy the economy </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Good job the Labour party wasn't in power at the time or it would be in a even bigger mess than it is now. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> BBC doin nothing useful here. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Is this the same Dr Gabriel Scally who is listed by the Kings Funds as an associate fellow of the Institute for Public Policy Research – a left wing organisation guaranteed to criticise any action taken by a Conservative government? </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> I think that poverty plays a big part of it. When people don't have enough money to rat properly, and live in.overcrowded and sub standard accommodation, they're much more vulnerable to severe illness. The UK has the highest number of people living under the breadline in Europe. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> They lied to us about it all, and they are still lying. The WHO's recommendation was that it was not necessary to lockdown. That doctor is full of lies. This is why Trump has cut all ties with the WHO. </COMMENT 6>

<COMMENT 10> Probably because people thinking 2m’s means 2mm’s. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> If statistics are to believed (and, yes, I know the old saying...) the number of Covid deaths in the UK is the fourth highest in Europe when seen as a proportion of the overall population. Only San Marino, Belgium and Andorra have a higher death rate in those terms. The UK has lost 588 people per million so far, and rising. Compare the farcical performance of our government with that of Germany (with a much greater population) where 104 per million have died. And that is 104 too many, needless to say. </COMMENT 11>

<COMMENT 1> Covid-19 is like Sharks, they are attracted by Blood, and the covid-19 appetite is FEAR, the more one FEARS the more covid-19 strives, but no one listens because after a while it is like crying WOLF,
Nobody believes who cries Wolf, but then, all of a sudden, people start Dying, the ones that have LOW or NO IMMUNITY! - That is the Population REDUCTION that was talked about when the 4 Pillars or Rules were established by some Secret Free Mason Society to reduce population! That is what the Elites want. Less people to care for Financially. All bunch of Mother Fuckers in Clown Costumes made by some wacko Deranged Taylors! </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Did  update 43 get taken down ? I can't find it </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> This is so helpful. Thank you. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Reinfection is possible because I got it AGAIN!!!! </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> The problem is with mutation. A number of people have gotten the same set of very unique symptoms after long periods of time with none of them, only to get very sick again. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blJVePv_E_E </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> I REALLY NEED TO KNOW if there is a relapse of infection (not reinfection) was is the risk of contaigon? If I've been feeling fine for better for two weeks but still test positive (PCR) should I stay quarantined and self isolate, get retested? In my area I've been told that I'll be fine to go back to work in the food industry after 2weeks without needing to be retested. I don't understand that certainty if I still tested positive 6weeks after onset of symptoms! Am I infectious or not?! </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> self inflicted gunshot to the head......cause of death.....COV19. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> ‪Dr., please consider posting a list of latest best practices for supporting optimal immunity (with disclaimer) at the end of each video? Great work deserves a wider audience. folks will pass simple advice along.‬ </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Are Rh Negatives immune to Covid-19? </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Can you explain what actually happened to those 100 over patients that were retested positive of covid 19, since reinfection is unlikely, could it be reactivation, like the herpes? </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> What about these docs?
https://youtu.be/xfLVxx_lBLU </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Thats the big question tho, is the covid virus mutating. And will it do so yearly like other flu viruses do. As some suggest it will return yearly. I was reading about overseas where those who had it and got rid of it, at a later point got it again. So were left with more questions it seems relating to is it mutating and how fast. Because with a new mutation means the human body must repeat the whole sickness process all over again to develop antibodies against it. One reference to this is at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToI_C7gKjtk </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Are you correct about saying sensitivity and specificity about antibody test? I'm afraid you are confusing those 2 words and actually you are totally misunderstanding each other. Per wikipedia, test sensitivity is the ability of a test to correctly identify those with the disease (true positive rate), whereas test specificity is the ability of the test to correctly identify those without the disease (true negative rate). Right? Or did I confuse what you explained??? </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Thank you for your impressive presentations, dear Doctor. I would like to ask you your opinion about  the meaning of my test IgM “not reactive” and IgG “borderline” (chemoluninescent test CLIA). I did not have any symptoms since 4 weeks at now, and I did have contacts with positive, severe patients.
Moreover: was detection of IgG performed in reinfected monkeys? Kind regards and thank you for you precious job </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Thank you for explaining this in common language. I wouldn't have possibly understood this in a million years, had I read the medical journals/research you cited, myself.

More power to your channel and thank you again. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> With the high level of comments on here. Can an educated person tell me why people are protesting? </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> So you could say after this research that herd immunity is most likely for those that have recovered from the virus and that a gradual removal of government restriction will only result in infection of those that have not been through an infection. 

Slightly off the subject but is there an indication that the seriousness of a case is proportionate to the concentration of the virus? </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> The data being used to generate the lethality rate of coronavirus (with which one can become infected) and COVID-19 (the actual disease which may or may not occur if one actually has the coronavirus) is highly unreliable. First of all, the CDC on their website writes concerning the "sequences" they are relying on to indicate the presence of the coronavirus that "every effort has been made to assure the accuracy of the sequence, but CDC cannot provide ANY WARRANT regarding their accuracy." (emp. mine).

Second, Steven Schwarz, the director of the Division of Vital Statistics, sent out a directive stating that one should report CV-19 as the cause of death if either it DID cause the death OR is ASSUMED to have caused the death. He then adds that if the person ALSO had COPD, asthma, etc., that should be reported IN PART II. (Why just 'Part II') The "assumption" clause introduces a healthy dose of arbitrariness into a stew already brewing with a test that the CDC refuses to endorse.

It gets worse. Dr. Cameron Kyle-Sidell has testified that while running an ICU at Maimonides dedicated exclusively to the WORST cases of CV-19 he has not seen even ONE case where CV-19 is conjoined to pneumonia. Instead, he has seen something like altitude sickness (from people who have been nowhere near a mountain recently!). The upshot: the medical community the whole world over has been told that CV-19 CAUSES pneumonia. Hence, if someone happens to test positive (even falsely, as it may be reasonably inferred, will happen quite often with a test of uncertain accuracy) AND has pneumonia or influenza AND dies . . . well, then that will go down in history as a death caused by CV-19.

Bad test + giving license to subjective assumptions + total misunderstanding of whatever the disease is = throw out the numbers & redo them on the basis of correct information and responsible reporting rules.

 Just in: deaths from pneumonia, heart attack, and stroke are ALL down from Dec. '19 through April, '20. Give yourself one guess why . . .

One more: a Stanford study based on a test for anti-bodies has concluded that in one region in CA, from 50 to 80× more persons have been infected than originally thought. Dr. Bhattacharya said this could lower the lethality of the coronavirus to slightly worse or double (flu: 1/1000, cv19: 1/500-1/999, .02% at worst) that of influenza. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Please explain, why those who do "virology" that the testing give a "false positive" and "false negative".
Please also explain WHY these doctors of having issues with this virus.

<COMMENT 9> Hi Sir, I loss my sense of smell and taste,  but Ill ask you later a question.   Because two months already that I'm using iodine and Vicks and put it in my nose before I wear my mask as added protection when I go outside.  And take note. I used two mask also.    And if I'm in my room, I used a diffuser machine .  in the machine, I added an iodine and essential oil, so that I can make my room smell nice and also disinfects by the iodine.    So my question, is over using use of iodine and Vicks, both putting directly my nose and by breathing it might cause an infection to my nose with my frequent use of this two things?

<COMMENT 4> I know two persons who recovered. They lost a great part of their lung capacity as if they had been smoking for years. Oximeter also indicates lower level of oxygen. I believe this could affect other organs in the long run leading to various diseases. I use a peak flow meter to monitor my lung function. It can be purchased from Walgreen or Amazon for $20+ dollars. Google provides a chart of normal lung peak expiratory flow as a function of sex, age and height. </COMMENT 4>

<COMMENT 12> The virus Germany figured out is way over blown? That virus?

Germany’s interior ministry:

Some of the report key passages are:

- The dangerousness of Covid-19 was overestimated: probably at no point did the danger posed by the new virus go beyond the normal level.

- The people who die from Corona are essentially those who would statistically die this year, because they have reached the end of their lives and their weakened bodies can no longer cope with any random everyday stress (including the approximately 150 viruses currently in circulation).

- Worldwide, within a quarter of a year, there has been no more than 250,000 deaths from Covid-19, compared to 1.5 million deaths [25,100 in Germany] during the influenza wave 2017/18.

- The danger is obviously no greater than that of many other viruses. There is no evidence that this was more than a false alarm.

- During the Corona crisis the State has proved itself as one of the biggest producers of Fake News.

The report focuses on the “manifold and heavy consequences of the Corona measures” and warns that these are “grave”.

More people are dying because of state-imposed Corona-measures than they are being killed by the virus.

<COMMENT 1> These  vaccine makers does not have any idea about covid -19 viruses' structural changes while replicating..First answer such silly questions and then make vaccine if they want to succeed in their hard works. </COMMENT 1>

<COMMENT 3> These pieces of garbage better not take away my way to work by forcing me to get this the keys hopefully Canada does with the states did bring this country to the fucking ground if there's no more freedom then why have a country </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Vaccines....Will everybody be forced to get mandatory, forced vaccines?...Don’t be me. I am an M.D. but let me tell you what you do not know about vaccines and what I didn’t know and what 90% of all M.D.'s do not know and what No politician knows... I did not know that Vaccines had not been tested against any placebo (ever). I did not know that animal testing would be skipped for the future COVID vaccines..I did not know the 30+ ingredients used in vaccines. I did not know that there are neurotoxic aluminum and mercury molecules in vaccines. I did not know enough to research vaccines before vaccinating my own children. 
I did not know that my own precocious, active, talking son would be vaccine-injured. I did not know that my own baby brother (also an M.D.) would become paralyzed (Guillain-Barre) and then die after his swine flu vaccine in the same hospital (Shands) where he had received his medical training. I did not know that my mother(an R.N.) would get 8 vaccines in 1 day to "catch-up" with newly added CDC vaccines to keep her job as Head Nurse in the Largest Hospital in the county and then get such severe, aggressive, progressive brain fog in days and become unable to dial a phone or push an elevator button or remember any of her  5 children in a few weeks and then have this "dementia" progress and then die in diapers


I did not know that vaccines were given a blanket indemnity from liability in 1986 and now total immunity for all COVID vaccines for the future. I did not know that we gave more vaccines than any other country starting on day #1...I did not know that we have the highest rate of SIDS of the top 35 industrialized countries... I did not know that we had more autism than any other country... I did not know that Vaccines could injure an infant's brain. 


I did not know that vaccines can result in autoimmunity and neurological damage. I did not know that herd immunity does not apply to vaccines and is a myth created by the CDC. I did not know that Vaccines have almost no effect after about four years. 


I did not know how emotional the topic would be and how angry people would be at me for just asking questions about Vaccine Safety. I did not know that pediatricians were paid to give vaccines. I did not know that the CDC owned the Patents on so many vaccines. 
I did not know that the NIH stands to make Billions of dollars on a COVID vaccine. 


I did not know how angry at myself I would be for not knowing. I did not know that the CDC committed fraud and destroyed their evidence in their vaccine safety studies when it showed vaccines can cause autistic neurological changes..I did not know that a whistleblower came forward with all the evidence but he was silenced. I did not know that Merck committed fraud in their vaccine research repeatedly. I did not know that aluminum molecules in the vaccine ingredients is connected to brain inflammation and brain inflammation has been proven to be connected to autism. 
I did not know that vaccines contained human cells from aborted fetuses..


I did not know how much mainstream media would censor the independent research that showed these facts...I did not know that 90% of all vaccine research that the CDC and FDA use to "approve" vaccines are done by the scientists hired by vaccine makers..I did not know if we were alone... I did not know how many other millions of parents and families in the world have been affected by vaccine reactions..I did not know how many would find, join, and share the Facebook help group= Vaccine Support Group on Facebook..I did not know that FB would delete the scientific medical research that had been suppressed, deleted, or censored until it happened to us...  Dr.MAS.. </COMMENT 4>

<COMMENT 9> Hey guys its vikstar123 here </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> To: The Prime Minister, Boris Johnson 

We are concerned by your announcement to ease the lockdown, risking a second peak of COVID-19 cases that threatens to overwhelm the NHS.

As UK healthcare workers on the frontline throughout the first wave of this crisis (and their supporters) we are writing to express grave concerns about the ability of the NHS to cope with the inevitable second wave which we predict will happen in 3-4 weeks’ time.

As of 13th May, according to the government’s own statistics, 33,186 UK citizens have lost their lives to coronavirus. [1] This is the highest death toll in Europe and the second highest in the world. [2]

The only way to ease lockdown restrictions safely, to return people to work and school and to get the economy moving again, is with a “ready to go” trace, test and isolate capability.

The UK has not had such a capability at any stage throughout this crisis and does not have it now. Campaigning organisation EveryDoctor recognises that the economy is of vital importance. As professionals who spend their working days caring for the health of the people of this nation, we are in a unique position to offer our thoughts. This country will only get going again when the virus is properly eliminated. We cannot rush this process.

The trace, test and isolate strategy has been deployed by countries such as South Korea, Taiwan, New Zealand and Germany. Some of these countries have much higher populations than the UK (Germany has 83 million people and 7,755 deaths) and significantly lower death tolls (New Zealand has 4.9 million people and 21 (yes, 21) deaths).

They all locked down sooner than the UK, procured tests, essential supplies and established testing teams to guide their management and have been able to ease restrictions in a controlled, scientific manner guided by data. None of their respective economies have taken the battering that the UK economy has.

Without this testing capability, the reproduction (“R”) number will rapidly increase and will exceed 1, which means that every infected person will infect more than one other person. We may not know the scale of this, because a persistent lack of adequate testing means we lack adequate evidence.

However, quietly and stealthily, coronavirus will take hold again. This is how pandemics behave. Infection rates will rise again, exponentially, as we saw in the UK from the end of March: there will be a second wave. New Zealand has eradicated the disease but Germany, South Korea and China, despite their responsibly guided approach to easing restrictions, have each seen a rebound increase in cases of coronavirus in the last 7-10 days and are having to reintroduce restrictions.[3]

For many doctors and nurses, one of the most difficult and stressful aspects of the experience has been the inability to deliver the excellent standard of care that we strive for daily, to our patients.

In many healthcare facilities, we have not had enough doctors, nurses, ventilators, drug infusion pumps, oxygen supplies or pipeline infrastructure, drugs to keep ventilated patients comfortable and asleep or, terrifyingly, personal protective equipment (PPE) for ourselves.

All of these have been depleted in the last two months, there are global shortages of many vital supplies and no prospect of being able to replenish them any time soon. This is not the time to be risking an increase in infections.

We are writing to you Prime Minister, to express that the NHS cannot cope with any more. We urge you, in the strongest possible terms and for the safety of the people of this country, to reconsider your decision and reimpose the lockdown restrictions until a test, trace and isolate capability is established and running fully.

Yours sincerely, 
The undersigned

<COMMENT 1> Alguien que lo resuma en español? 😔 </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> It’s rather amazing how every answer is predicated on erroneous assumptions which lead to not answering the question at all. You almost never get the right answer from incorrect premises. What has happened to the standards of scholarship in the UK? </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Calum Williams is so cute </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> So many different options with no real guidance </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Bet there will be better pandemic prep </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> The end of Hog Factory farming and needless animal suffering is something I desperately hope to see in my life time. The only reason they are being bred in this way is because they are the most profitable meat industry in the world. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> So you guys are economists but you need to think like a normal business man, after this for a long time, a lot of people will not wanna do business with China. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Unbelievable - this is probably the worst economic overview/forecast assessment  I have seen in a long time - reminds me of a high school presentation.  Pretty sick to consider this is coming from The Economist. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> I’m sorry but I just find this way too odd, the Wuhan market was a lie. The people working at the lab who worried about the pandemic breaking from their Wuhan lab were shut up by their government and the only countries that are looking into the origins are Australia who was threatened by China and the UK who has proposed to sue the country. This is clearly a silent war made by China and I just can’t believe otherwise and neither can the mentioned countries.. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> What a numpty. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Another video claiming that China will overtake the US.... not going to happen.
China gave loans to underdeveloped countries in Africa and around the World for hundreds of billions of dollars and all of those countries will default on those loans, many have already gave notice that they won’t be able to pay, that will hit China’s economy very hard.
Also, China’s image around the World took a huge hit, then add their latest policies in Hong Kong and their hostile approach to Taiwan, all of that equals to being the most hated country in the World right now.
I can see USA and other countries imposing penalties on China for the foreseeable future and companies transferring their manufacturing either back to their home country or to another country in Asia like Indonesia for example.
China knows this whole virus thing was a slap on the face to their image, there is a reason their propaganda machine is working 24/7 now to save face.
You claim on this video that their economy is back to 90% of their normalcy, that is completely inaccurate, you can turn on the factories and the machines but if there is no demand for their product then guess what, it doesn’t work. Everyone is saving whatever little money they have to ride this out, countries like the US will recover much faster than China. 
And if worst come to worst we always have the greatest military power this World has ever seen, no way for China to match our force. The US will keep being at the top of the food chain for many more years to come, deal with it. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Lots of stuttering and they seemed to be winging it. No depth in their comments. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Can we called it the ultimate disruptor?  I think so. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Will movie theaters have anyone in them </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> We will always prevail over pandemics. Nothing can stop the human becoming superior over pandemicd. In fact, human can always improve faster with great acceleration when besets by natural catastrophe. Human invent, create, and find ways to develop advance technology. The human mind is limitless with ideas to create. The human mind can create out of nothing to something that can continuously provide him the ability to create more something that the he needs ease his existence free from difficulties. And it will continue, and contiinue to galactic enter planetary existence. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Political virus that kills USA not the Virus. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> There will be no "New Normal".  Give it up.  Not going to happen.  
A year from now you will realize how silly people sounded even thinking the world would make permanent changes for a temporary problem. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> For us we believe in awareness! Thanks for sharing awareness! Also Looking into other concepts to be aware of after this time! </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> The big pandemic is 5G </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Now that the unnecessaries are back in circulation, my guess is 200-250k dead by July 4th. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 10> JUSTIN!!! I AM GOING! </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Trudeau is a globalist and supported the TPP, until Trump stopped it.   JT does not care for Canadians and the rule of law.   End this state of emergency now.  Open parliament now. </COMMENT 11>

<COMMENT 19> Trudeau looking more like a puppet lol </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> The CDC is now confirming pretty much everything we tinfoil hatters have been saying since this insanity started:

- COVID-19 tests may be wrong half the time.

- If you don't live in a nursing home, your chances of dying of this flu strain are practically NIL. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 1> I think World must come out new method to clean our hand nomore with chemical nor alcohol sterra but with pure nature sea salt water see how the c19 reacted...... </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> I think we singapore must change our daily prepair eating pattern no more cold food and beverages but hot soap and gravy food like hot pourage ........ </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> The clips Are edited and do not show the movements in total of the first person " Infected". Results are made to mislead and frighten. In my opinion FAKE </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Propaganda. If your under 80 you have little risk. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> The who head also a big time CHUMP. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Fake news and lies </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Interesting video, What we needed was a part 2 to this video, We needed another set where his hands were washed of as much or all of the paint he had placed on his body then conduct the same study to see if anything shows up then we can see how well using safe practices work. i believe the  first set was to instill fear. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> And this video shows why masks are particularly dangerous to wear. Not only are they harmful to your lungs if worn long periods of time, especially if you have asthma, you can breathe in the virus, which is 120 nm in size THROUGH the holes of an n95 mask, which are 300 nm in size... And you can also breath it OFF the mask that over time gets stained with the virus as you touch it with your hands and you walk through aerosol clouds. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Should be thanking all frontliners and medical health workers for their service. They play a big role to combat this pandemic. Mass testing should really be done as soon as possible.
Does anyone know where can I buy Covid-19 Antibody testing kit? </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Attention Everyone. Whats with the lady from Adelaide who contracted COVID-19 on the Ruby Princess with her husband. He died and she recovered and was given the all clear. Well she has it again and our State Gov is not counting it as a new infection and treating it as an old infection. She apparently has been out and about. This proves it can re-erupt in a recovered person to full blown COVID-19 </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> BS information for dumb people. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> While this a great illustration of how easily fluorescent paint can spread, it leaves out the fact there needs to be enough of the viral particles actually in ones system. If there are not enough of the viral particles, then one won't get the virus. No idea how many viral particles are needed for the flu, the common cold, or for Covid-19. The video is over simplified. And another person pointed out there was more to the study as to if employees served the food, there was little spread. Watching this just underscores to me the importance of frequent hand washing. And probably continuing to go to restaurants that are not self serve. I've never been a big buffet person regardless of germ spreading or not spreading. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Bombshell Study Shows COVID-19 Infection Rates Declining In States That Lifted Lockdowns </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> VICKS KILLS CORONAVIRUS in the air and through inhalation!
Mankind made the same mistake a century ago, trying to eradicate an airborne virus with disinfectants & detergents instead of with eucalyptus oil. Only when they started using Vicks & similar remedies, the  Spanish Flu was finally contained. Simply blow Vicks around from fans & air-conditioners. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Can you guys please repeat the same film over and over again? I didn't see it enough the first 3 times </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Fack coronavirus fack </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> The theory is sound, but the draw back is it is assuming the virus multiplies fast enough they there is enough virus itself to spread that far, wide and heavily. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Sperm everywhere </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> All this useful information from the TV show that did a test segment shooting a cannon in the direction of a housing tract in Danville, CA.

They would all be in jail for manslaughter if person who’s bedroom was ventilated was in their bedroom sleeping.

Keep up the FINE investigative reporting Einstein’s....... </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> So, the lesson here is to NOT squirt a handful of Covid-19 virus into your hands, rub them together thoroughly, don’t wash your hands and then go to an All-You-Can-Eat buffet and stick your hands in all the trays......
...if you can help it.

And stop talking about SCAMDEMIC </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Next speaker please! </COMMENT 3>

<COMMENT 5> Biggest fraud talking </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> DemocRATS governor Cuomo and DemocRATS mayor Bill de Blasio are welcoming Wuhan virus to kill Americans.
DemocRATS governor Cuomo and DemocRATS mayor Bill de Blasio are supporting protesters thugs to rob and to burn all the business facilities. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> ther talk in cnn like its their show </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Resign already. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> every politician jumping on the band wagon </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> New York is burning shame </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Psalm 1:1 Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.
When a man has once given place to evil counsel, or to his own sin nature, he begins to forget himself in his sin, and so falls into contempt of God, which is called the seat of the scorners. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Governor Andrew Cuomo a man with a brain that doing outstanding job in New York. The constitution must be apply according to the situation view political economic. Very important to follow estanlished law. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> I just want those protesters won't create more corona pandemic, I saw so many people didn't wear masks. Please if you want to protest, wear mask. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Mr Cuomo , are born stupid or you went to school fot that? :)))))) </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> How many people got infected yesterday? </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Thousands and thousands of protesters crammed together with no masks on...if there is no one single outbreak in 2 weeks, it was all a lie </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Fake actor </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> its dangerous to loot... the cops dont like competition </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> hey look children... its duhduh the clown      preaching peace but follow my command or the stormtroopers will visit </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> What I don't get is all these politicians sit there saying I agree with the protestors and what happen was wrong and should not have happened and we need to fix our system. But here the thing, what have they done to fix the problem. If Cuomo wanted to stick it to Trump he could have said something like "What was done was wrong and I want to fix this problem so we never have this problem in New York State, I'm today going to sit down with our legislators and see if we can draft laws to address police brutality and how some are being targeted by police action. While Trump may just want to talk about how sad and disturbing I at least want to make sure this doesn't happen and fixes the problems in our State and if Trump wants to do something then I invite him to work with our federal legislators to fix the problem at a federal level". Something to show action, but instead he just wants to say there no problem in there state, Trump is wrong and we don't need the national guard. But sorry Cuomo you're asleep at the wheel and instead of stomping on the fire and putting it out, you're just let it smolder so people and property are still hurt. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 2> A study involving Covid19 patients with Von Willebrand Disease might support that hypothesis.
Great video! Thanks. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> I have read studies on the affect of N-acetyl cysteine in relationship to pulmonary hypertension. The studies have contradicted themselves, with some showing (in rats) that it increases PH, while in others it is suggested that NAC may be a treatment for PH.

I am currently supplementing with NAC and have hypertension. I started on this supplementation after viewing your videos on COVID 19. 

Could you please clarify this NAC PH connection? Perhaps you can address this in one of your videos. 

Thank you very much. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Yes yes, 8 people on ventilators. It's 11-13 patients like these here in my ICU. Getting a bit "sick" from all this pandemic. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Shots for the sheeple </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> ...so... heparin drip or enoxaparin 40mg qd it is then? </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> You're being a little loosey goosey by stating that your hypothesis is validated by these results. Please keep in mind that your mostly layman followers are looking to you for information. There is even a little hero worship evident in some their posts. This behooves you the be stringent in your use of terminology. Otherwise, I enjoy your offerings. You offer another valuable information stream about this important subject. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> I love these videos.  Thank you.  In one of your other videos, mention was made regarding oxygen being a key factor in assisting recovery from Covid.  In this video mention was made of not using ventilation until patients have difficulty breathing it on their own.  Why not put the Covid patients on ventilation treatments immediately to evaluate whether patients have quicker recovery time?  This would ensure they are getting precise oxygen amounts as soon as Covid-19 is detected. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> The notion that exposure to the 'other four' human coronaviruses which cause colds can cross-protect against SARS-Cov2 might explain the paradox of smokers having better COVID-19 survival: Since its well-documented that smokers experience more episodes of  bronchitis and pneumonia than non-smokers, it would follow that they have more exposure to common viruses including coronaviruses, and hence, harbor more antibodies that are cross-protective. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> in fact, the flu in 1969 has caused the same type of blood clots - https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/s-0028-1108874
...and thrombosis in covid-19 is already known for months... Journalists should do some more serious research rather than spreading panic and fear. In 1969 blood thinner could dramatically reduce mortality of infected persons </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> This video was disapproved by 83 people who were hoping to see Bevis and Butthead talking. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> This likely means a covid vaccine would provide protection against some of the common cold coronaviruses....the problem is big pharma would not like that.... </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Wow,  so they finally acknowledge people may have some partial immunity from being infected by one of the 4 common cold coronavirus....
Doesn't take a einstein to figure that out....now they need to see if they people who had activated t-cells have kids under 12 who constantly get sick with virus after virus and bring them home.  I cant count the times I got sick from my kids bringing something home from school or day care. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Quercetin and alkaline water?????????
Doc. I urge you to please take a look into this, in regards to supplemental research. Please make a short video on this topic if it's of any importance. Thanks
-future doctor Brudnicki-Tennessee </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Great research which doesn't appear in mainstream media in my country. I don't know if i understood it right but probably covid 19 gives a long lasting immunity. And some  people not infected with covid 19 have T-Cells recognizing Sars-Cov2 cause some of it proteins are similar to other coronaviruses. If that's the fact does it mean that we need a lower percentage of people infected with Sars-Cov2 for the pandemic to burn itself out casue some people will never become because of the proteins triggered by other cov infections. My conclusion (may be wrong) is that pandemic is gonna end sooner until the vaccine is ready and we will not need the vaccine already. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Is that mean if we infect people with other coronavirus which is not lethal or consequences are common cold might help to educate T cell which helps our immune system to fight back Sars-Cov-2 in more profound way? </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> To take the time to break down a complicated subject and make it understandable to the layman like me is a tribute to a great educator, amazing patience, a great doctor. Thank you doc, youre an amazing credit to your proffesion . </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Getting any preliminary data on how the virus attacks the cardiovascular system?   https://youtu.be/mzluiL-_eeM </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Could a breathalyzer test for von Willebrand factor be created to test for COVID? Does VWF appear in our breath? I am imagining a rapid presumptive test. </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 5> When people are having symptons so bad , (this might sound cold,) but, they need to consider signing DNR papers. If they're on ventilators, they aren't breathing on their own. Why prolong things.  Its sad but obvious. The way it is, no one wants to enter hospitals , clinics, nursing homes etc.   These places are filled with diseases, and germs. Now a family member cant even be with a loved one. Or a father witnessing the birth of his children. Our loved ones dont get any moral support. They should be able to suit up like doctors and nurses fron head to toe, so please let at least one family member can sit with their family. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Hey, Christy!
Today I visited a medical doctor about my swollen knee.
Incidentally, I asked him about the purpose of wearing facial masks against the virus.
The Covid-19 virus is 125nm, the smallest pore in a N95 mask: 330nm.
How is the mask ( a filter ) going to prevent the virus, which is 2.6 times smaller, from traveling into your lungs?
The poor doctor babbled about :"... when someone sneezes... etc.".
Bs!
Why? Because even when the mask stops the minute aerosol droplets on the outside they - because of their minuscule size - in room temperature will change immediately into water vapor.
The virus will travel unimpeded thru your goofy surgical mask into your lungs with no problems ( remember: the holes in the mask that is supposed to prevent the virus from entering your body are 2.6 times bigger than the virus itself ).
"Well, at least the mask offers some sort of protection..." the poor doctor babbled.
"I just fucking told you the holes in the mask are way bigger than the virus and simply cannot stop it!"
I did not say the last sentence but...wtf is with this "mask nonsense"?
Am I wrong somewhere about the nonsense of wearing masks?
Anyone wanna explain here why to use the filter that doesn't filter what it is supposed to filter out should be used?
Correct me where I am wrong. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> I also once held a medical degree, the doctor came in the office and told me to put it back on the wall. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Correction : it is yet to be proven with a degree of scientific certainty that the virus jumped from human to animal in a food market.

At the moment, it is thought, it is possible, it could be.

If the first sentence this doctor utters, with such self-assurance, is actually inaccurate (because it has not yet been proven) it makes it very difficult to trust and believe anything she says afterwards.

I cannot therefore take her seriously and stopped watching the video.

I like to be open minded to theories, but believes cannot be spoken about as facts, this is how things go wrong.  And she is a medical doctor, she should know better.

I certainly would not trust her to examine me. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> First of all lady masks are all over the internet and saying people who don't have covid19 that shouldn't wear a mask is simply idiotic cause people can not have symtoms and still have it, thus your saying they shouldn't wear one cause they think they are not infected. Think before you talk </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> 7:04   This video was posted 2 months ago and it is now recommended that everyone wear a (non n95) mask when in public places such as a store or crowded area. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Man is THIS outdated and frankly wrong information.. SHE should have taken this down OR corrected it by now.. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Me just breathing is what lam feeling even that is corona </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> What do you mean don't wear a mask?? Only if you cough...disagree!! </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Let us properly address the so-called "studies" designed to discredit hydroxychloroquine used in conjunction with Covid-19 cases and deaths. The main stream media is only zeroing in on negative studies and omitting positive studies. A proper study should emphasize the use by  a knowledgeable physician of hydroxychloroquine as an INTEGRAL part of a cocktail of Hydroxychloroquine + Zinc + ZPak. Where is the study that provides this cocktail at the first sign of medically observed symptoms as an early-stage protocol. The so-called negative studies IGNORE (1) the COCKTAIL requirement; and they ignore the date on the time-line that treatment was first administered. Always. In other words - they are designed to fail in terms of demonstrating the efficacy of the cocktail treatment, given as an early-stage protocol. Bogus studies. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Thanks for your advice regarding Covid 19. I like to draw few points to fight against Covid 19. Kindly take Homeopathy Medicine to prevent corona virus. Start it just now. Take  Camphora 1M (1000 CH) - 2 drops in 1 tsp water at morning and afternoon 2 times for 2 days in empty stomach and repeat after 1 month for prevent Covid 19. Avoid any food 20 min before and after taking that homeopathy medicine. Take Vegetable Diet with Vitamin C fruits and need little Sunlight and Brave Heart. Take more water and exercise regularly with proper sleep. May God bless you. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Thank you for letting know when I know have coronavirus! </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> when info starts out stating that viral jump from wet market. you can bet its bs! </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Dr christy does patients with heart disease need to be tested? Or do they have the option not to be tested? </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> The next extinction event will be caused by stupidity,not a natural disaster, not to say that stupidity is Not a natural disaster. I wear a kiosk respirator in public to protect me and my elderly parent from all the geniuses who refuse to wear masks to prevent them from spreading it. Asymptomatic idiots who obviously just don't care or are just plain stupid. Typhoid Mary had an excuse,she did'nt know she was spreading that, these people today don't have that luxury. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> COVID 19 started at a lab. 80% of infected are asymptomatic. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 10> To: The Prime Minister, Boris Johnson 

We are concerned by your announcement to ease the lockdown, risking a second peak of COVID-19 cases that threatens to overwhelm the NHS.

As UK healthcare workers on the frontline throughout the first wave of this crisis (and their supporters) we are writing to express grave concerns about the ability of the NHS to cope with the inevitable second wave which we predict will happen in 3-4 weeks’ time.

As of 13th May, according to the government’s own statistics, 33,186 UK citizens have lost their lives to coronavirus. [1] This is the highest death toll in Europe and the second highest in the world. [2]

The only way to ease lockdown restrictions safely, to return people to work and school and to get the economy moving again, is with a “ready to go” trace, test and isolate capability.

The UK has not had such a capability at any stage throughout this crisis and does not have it now. Campaigning organisation EveryDoctor recognises that the economy is of vital importance. As professionals who spend their working days caring for the health of the people of this nation, we are in a unique position to offer our thoughts. This country will only get going again when the virus is properly eliminated. We cannot rush this process.

The trace, test and isolate strategy has been deployed by countries such as South Korea, Taiwan, New Zealand and Germany. Some of these countries have much higher populations than the UK (Germany has 83 million people and 7,755 deaths) and significantly lower death tolls (New Zealand has 4.9 million people and 21 (yes, 21) deaths).

They all locked down sooner than the UK, procured tests, essential supplies and established testing teams to guide their management and have been able to ease restrictions in a controlled, scientific manner guided by data. None of their respective economies have taken the battering that the UK economy has.

Without this testing capability, the reproduction (“R”) number will rapidly increase and will exceed 1, which means that every infected person will infect more than one other person. We may not know the scale of this, because a persistent lack of adequate testing means we lack adequate evidence.

However, quietly and stealthily, coronavirus will take hold again. This is how pandemics behave. Infection rates will rise again, exponentially, as we saw in the UK from the end of March: there will be a second wave. New Zealand has eradicated the disease but Germany, South Korea and China, despite their responsibly guided approach to easing restrictions, have each seen a rebound increase in cases of coronavirus in the last 7-10 days and are having to reintroduce restrictions.[3]

For many doctors and nurses, one of the most difficult and stressful aspects of the experience has been the inability to deliver the excellent standard of care that we strive for daily, to our patients.

In many healthcare facilities, we have not had enough doctors, nurses, ventilators, drug infusion pumps, oxygen supplies or pipeline infrastructure, drugs to keep ventilated patients comfortable and asleep or, terrifyingly, personal protective equipment (PPE) for ourselves.

All of these have been depleted in the last two months, there are global shortages of many vital supplies and no prospect of being able to replenish them any time soon. This is not the time to be risking an increase in infections.

We are writing to you Prime Minister, to express that the NHS cannot cope with any more. We urge you, in the strongest possible terms and for the safety of the people of this country, to reconsider your decision and reimpose the lockdown restrictions until a test, trace and isolate capability is established and running fully.

Yours sincerely, 
The undersigned

<COMMENT 2> A study involving Covid19 patients with Von Willebrand Disease might support that hypothesis.
Great video! Thanks. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> I have read studies on the affect of N-acetyl cysteine in relationship to pulmonary hypertension. The studies have contradicted themselves, with some showing (in rats) that it increases PH, while in others it is suggested that NAC may be a treatment for PH.

I am currently supplementing with NAC and have hypertension. I started on this supplementation after viewing your videos on COVID 19. 

Could you please clarify this NAC PH connection? Perhaps you can address this in one of your videos. 

Thank you very much. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Yes yes, 8 people on ventilators. It's 11-13 patients like these here in my ICU. Getting a bit "sick" from all this pandemic. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Shots for the sheeple </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> ...so... heparin drip or enoxaparin 40mg qd it is then? </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> You're being a little loosey goosey by stating that your hypothesis is validated by these results. Please keep in mind that your mostly layman followers are looking to you for information. There is even a little hero worship evident in some their posts. This behooves you the be stringent in your use of terminology. Otherwise, I enjoy your offerings. You offer another valuable information stream about this important subject. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> I love these videos.  Thank you.  In one of your other videos, mention was made regarding oxygen being a key factor in assisting recovery from Covid.  In this video mention was made of not using ventilation until patients have difficulty breathing it on their own.  Why not put the Covid patients on ventilation treatments immediately to evaluate whether patients have quicker recovery time?  This would ensure they are getting precise oxygen amounts as soon as Covid-19 is detected. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> The notion that exposure to the 'other four' human coronaviruses which cause colds can cross-protect against SARS-Cov2 might explain the paradox of smokers having better COVID-19 survival: Since its well-documented that smokers experience more episodes of  bronchitis and pneumonia than non-smokers, it would follow that they have more exposure to common viruses including coronaviruses, and hence, harbor more antibodies that are cross-protective. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> in fact, the flu in 1969 has caused the same type of blood clots - https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/s-0028-1108874
...and thrombosis in covid-19 is already known for months... Journalists should do some more serious research rather than spreading panic and fear. In 1969 blood thinner could dramatically reduce mortality of infected persons </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> This video was disapproved by 83 people who were hoping to see Bevis and Butthead talking. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> This likely means a covid vaccine would provide protection against some of the common cold coronaviruses....the problem is big pharma would not like that.... </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Wow,  so they finally acknowledge people may have some partial immunity from being infected by one of the 4 common cold coronavirus....
Doesn't take a einstein to figure that out....now they need to see if they people who had activated t-cells have kids under 12 who constantly get sick with virus after virus and bring them home.  I cant count the times I got sick from my kids bringing something home from school or day care. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Quercetin and alkaline water?????????
Doc. I urge you to please take a look into this, in regards to supplemental research. Please make a short video on this topic if it's of any importance. Thanks
-future doctor Brudnicki-Tennessee </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Great research which doesn't appear in mainstream media in my country. I don't know if i understood it right but probably covid 19 gives a long lasting immunity. And some  people not infected with covid 19 have T-Cells recognizing Sars-Cov2 cause some of it proteins are similar to other coronaviruses. If that's the fact does it mean that we need a lower percentage of people infected with Sars-Cov2 for the pandemic to burn itself out casue some people will never become because of the proteins triggered by other cov infections. My conclusion (may be wrong) is that pandemic is gonna end sooner until the vaccine is ready and we will not need the vaccine already. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Is that mean if we infect people with other coronavirus which is not lethal or consequences are common cold might help to educate T cell which helps our immune system to fight back Sars-Cov-2 in more profound way? </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> To take the time to break down a complicated subject and make it understandable to the layman like me is a tribute to a great educator, amazing patience, a great doctor. Thank you doc, youre an amazing credit to your proffesion . </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Getting any preliminary data on how the virus attacks the cardiovascular system?   https://youtu.be/mzluiL-_eeM </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Could a breathalyzer test for von Willebrand factor be created to test for COVID? Does VWF appear in our breath? I am imagining a rapid presumptive test. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Maybe venulator use too much will harm the lungs somehow </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 12> The PM clown and the slow clown government have cost so many British people their lifes but there is even no minute to mourn and to pay tribute to the 35000 dead British people and their families, parents, and children. Heart of darkness! Yes - Cumming has broken the rules and so the government and PM too.  Tell this the 35000 dead British people! But the British people have to pay the price - and to obey - they are slaves of their government that they have voted for. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Can’t we just have his script, it would be so much faster to get the knowledge </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Johnson put Cummings ahead of the population. If Cummings isn't sacked, he should resign. </COMMENT 14>

<COMMENT 1> Studies revealed people who watch Fox News are less informed than people who watch no news at all.
Its literally the world's dumbest news channel by far! </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> All medical professionals who participated in the 2020 coronavirus hoax should be stripped of their licenses and barred from practicing medicine. It is part of a deliberate plot to institute a global police state worthy of the pages of science fiction. Western medicine and psychiatry are apparatuses of tyranny. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Fake News like fox and Trump. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Fox News on Ebola: says that Obama is incompetent, that he is not handling it seriously, yet it never even got to the United States. 

Fox News on Coronavirus: says it’s an attempt to impeach the President, undermines it,  yet it f*cks up our whole economy and results in hundreds of thousands of deaths around the world. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Liar liar pants on fire! </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> MEANWHILE... 100K + DEATHS LATER AND CLIMBING!! </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> I DONT SEE HOW PEOPLE CAN CONTINUE TO WATCH CABLE NEWS FAITHFULLY ... THEY MUST BE PUTTING SUBLIMINAL MESSAGES IN THEIR NEWS .. ESPECIALLY  FOX.. BRAIN WASHED </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> All Fox News reporter’s need only death. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Yes, rebublicans Are delusional narcissistic idiots,  he rapes woman, mocks people who have altzimers , and  much more, 40% of the stuff he says is a lie, or can not be backed up. It’s sad how desperate people are for the economy. If he did what a regular person would do he would have saved 100,000 of people by containing them in quarantine. (Like every regular leader in other countries) I think it’s pretty simple that he is actually a little mentally ill (Hydroxychloroquine). Yes he does to need to  be put away or dead. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> They lie about lieing </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Oh i l knew  my Republican buddies are full of  "It" , funny  thing  ,  because  some of them  would  also  say "No no, oh i wouldn't  never  said  that,  or do "that ", who me?
Oh kkkay🤨 sure, and whenever I  catch their lies,  it's  like  listening  to a crack addicted,  lie  after  lie

<COMMENT 2> You mean "Unit Psychosis"?

On the average it's approximately 0.5%-1.5% of patients that get confused in the ICU etc. That is if they aren't Obtunded.

ARDS is my Job. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Stories like these make me so fortunate to have my mother (age 96) pass from covid 19 with none of the toxic psychosis that manifests as a drug induced ICU delirium coma. She was not in the ICU, just an isolated room in a care unit, and was allowed to die a natural death. I am comforted that she went very peacefully. She would claim to "see" her brother Bob who had been dead for 18 years. I interpret this as stepping into the afterlife, and then stepping back. Eventually, she spent more and more time in the afterlife, until it was final. RIP mom, I wish you didn't have to go, but am grateful you didn't suffer. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Wonder if the mind altering unhappy state is because this might be a manufactured virus.
Were these people religious? Reason I ask such a strange question is because of a recent video I saw where someone suggested they had isolated a specific gene related to religiosity!!! And a virus could me made to alter that!!! religion" gene??? Scary stuff...
https://youtu.be/oWkyRMT9qqQ
Am not a conspiracy theorist...just trying to fit all the pieces of the puzzle together to find the truth.
Hope more people start reporting details instead of the same old stuff.
This is the first ever sensible and and informative piece of news I have seen of COVID-19.  Thank you. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Torturous procedures, and you call it health care. An avalanche of ineptitude called modern medicine. All the well paid professional toadies 'just following orders' in a place where cruelty & ignorance have joined forces against better judgement & compassion or anything close to a talent for healing. No responsibility at all for the evil being performed mindlessly in exchange for a paycheck. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Is there any other way without sedated someone to survive? This is crazy af </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> My ex-husband had an episode of ICU delirium after a motorcycle accident. Hospital staff told me what it was, but offered little other information or support. I went home thinking he could stay in this state indefinitely. People are right: there needs to be psychological support for both patients and those close to them. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> The induced comas sent them to places similar to hell. Things depicted in the book of Dante's. Not trying to make this religious but do you think there were msgs from their dives to the otherside? </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> my aunt and her family got infected but for some reason it got her the harderst despite her being in her early 30s and had no prior illness. she described how the pain was so bad and was suffocating from inflamed lungs that she was really saying goodbye to my uncle and cousin and wanted to die. luckily she recovered after weeks in the ER. the virus is no joke. i don’t really know how people get infected or how often it really happens but it’s crazy for people are going out unprotected like if it doesn’t exist anymore. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Oh my goodness. These people are going to need a lot of emotional support and mental health care now. Please keep talking about it. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Talking about it isn't enough, we need action!  This is really scary!  I've been worried about the COVID-19 survivors because no one is talking about this! </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> So these people may survive the viruis but may end up not living ir even killing themselves? 

I think in a few years we as a society are going to be asking some very tough questions . </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> When I was 7 I experienced a body temp of 106, I had a repeating nightmare almost every night for ~10 years. This is worrisome as my experiences were similar to this. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Propaganda </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> This is a lot worse than any flu I've seen. I've worked in Critical care for 20 years and in that time leading up to the beginning of the pandemic, I'd only ever seen 4 patients proned; that means we nurse the patient in a face down front crawl swimming position. In my first shift during the pandemic I saw three proned in one day. This went on to happen to nearly every patient admitted and ventilated in our ICU, and it rarely worked. I've also witnessed a high ratio of patients having multiple pulmonary emboli (blood clots to the lung ), deep vein thrombosis, kidney failure, stroke and heart attacks. The fall out from this is going to be very difficult to deal with. Patients who survive will almost definitely develop severe PTSD. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> I've been under multiple chemically induced Comas , one time for more than a month.  They woke me periodically to make sure my brain was functioning properly and i never experienced this whatsoever. sSo I think they're just trying to cover up for when the truth comes out from some of these patients that they are having a false memory and that they didn't do these horrendous acts to these people while under an induced coma </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Im not an expert on this issue but this seems less related to covid and more about what sedation can do and the mental stress it can result in. I'm not sure where this is, but in my area there definitely is mental health support- this is a worry. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> If this ever happens to me God forbid it, I would probably have to keep telling myself none of this is really happening and to relax. I pray for all those Covid-19 patients this sounds really horrible ❤️❤️❤️ </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> u </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 2> one doesnt need to have corona....blood clumps...heart problems  lund problems and so much more caused by all the poison and artificial biology falling from the sky.,chemtrails.....all the nanodust particles free delivered for everybody on the planet causing suffering beyond words...of course,,,despite the fact,,,its oficialy anounced by nasa...and others with more sofisticated ames like ,,,solarmanagement.weathermodification and so on,,,, ,mayority of population has no clue that this is happening every single day.....its consequences are totaly ignored by medicine...as this is not convinient for the powers behind the wheel of destruction...some people commit suicide...because they dont find help,caused by those nanoparticles,which in some parts of population cause not only all in the video named simptoms...but much more pain and suffering.,morgellions,ignored by medicine.....independent doctors would be surprised what they would find in all population,,if they would make independent studys ,,looking for nanoparticles...and all those other toxins..falling from the sky,infesting  the waters,,the earth..all lifeforms aluminium strontium barrium causing.the decline of health all over the planet.... the slow death of all lifeforms....here on my end...in a specific area...we cant breathe...not because of covoid,,,but the non stop poisening from above plus radiation,crime on humanity in every aspect of life, </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Can microwave length radiation case the same symptoms? </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Human race has NOT found a cure for the FLU or the common cold or AIDS, What makes people think we can find a cure for Covid 19. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Thank u sir u HV been very honest ,I'm sure it a bactiral infection and the things u say do happen,Italy has the same findings as urself and I think has sent the findings to American Reaserch institute,I hvnt heard how they responded to that ,am so glad u are now finding s way to treat people </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Question- for how long can an assimptomatic person be contagious? </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Corona virus has no science explanation until now .I think it could be from the pollution or maybe it slipped from an experimental lab , it also could be if we look at it  carefully , A punishment from God for all the evilness that happens in this World . Nothing will cure it , it will come back if a vaccine is not out soon. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> R seniors more prone to coronavirus deaths because they also represent the biggest candidates for previously taking flu shot¿¿ let me know what you think😔 </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> "these are what you will loathe among the flying creatures. They should not be eaten. They are a loathsome thing: .. the bat". Leviticus chapter 11. The Bible was right 4000 years ago, because its wisdom came from Jehovah the creator. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Does this inflammation cause “brain fog” (that is what I call it)?  I also call my state “half-unconscious”.  I heard some people have confusion and poor memory. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Anyone who believes the Virus has not been built into the killer it's meant to be need's a quick reality check for a long time as this thing (the Virus)unfolds before us, revealing it's one true purpose.. Can anyone guess who is sitting on top of this most unFortune(ate) Kookie ??
PS. What's the idea behind them (?) putting the metal "Lead" into everything that is imported?  Everything from our children's toys to ...Well..pretty much everything!! 
I say let's bring back all the jobs, all the industries to Everything, ..All back to the USA. And bite the bullet and the chips fall where they may.
This is the greatest Country of the world and if we don't take a stand now, we may never get a chance of being the greatest Free nation we all know and Love ! 
They aren't called Red Commies for nothing. They will take over everything from the World as soon as they can  once they know they have everything wrapped up and maybe a whole lot sooner if we as a nation do not have a Strong Leader who has the level of strategic control of what makes this United States of America 
(Sorry, this is all I can do for now, my back is killing me from an accident that I was hit by a car traveling 40 mph.) Sorry! </COMMENT 11>

Now that the veil has been lifted on how broken America is, it's pretty obvious there's no way 14,000,000 Americans have been tested.

<COMMENT 8> I'll depend on my own body to defend itself without injecting foreign things directly into my bloodstream... bypassing all of the body's natural defences. I've managed to stay alive and healthy for almost 70 years with this philosophy. I'd rather be infected with the virus than get vaccinated. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Is intubation the same as incubation ? </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Excellent video as always.  I am an RN and I work in a hospital in the south.  We are just beginning to see covid 19 patients.  We are tracking and managing our ppe very carefully.  But we had staff do a hand hygiene tracker.  They found our hand washing rate to be around 30% which is appalling.  Everyone is just relying on the hand sanitizer outside every room.  Its better than nothing,  but if you are taking off a pair of gloves,  you should be washing your hands.  I think the virus is going to cause us all to be more serious about hand washing. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Thank you doctor mike for the info Godbless Stay safe ❤️ </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Here’s a question: do basic medical masks (like the one in my profile photo) work? A cashier at the gas station went on a tirade about how they are entirely useless and only air sealed N95 masks work. Is this true? (I am a healthcare worker, btw. I just want to know if what I’m using is enough, since it’s all we have..) </COMMENT 12>

<COMMENT 6> Everyone must wear ppe to be 100% safe from covid and must be lock up in a jail.. every life is important.. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Action speaks louder than words. If there is an excuse not to wear mask on public speaking/announcement, why other average person can not have other excuse not to wear mask at all time. Lead by example, show how it is done for everyone without excuse by acting it out from a behavior level. Senior officials should wear masks on high profile public announcement/speaking to give impression to the public to follow the same rule and sense of urgency. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Wearing masks has NEVER been established to prevent disease.

When you’re wearing a mask, you’re inducing an hypoxic injury, Pseudo hypoxia.
When you wear a mask you are restricting airflow
You’re also breathing in more Carbon dioxide
Now you’re creating a pseudo hypoxic state, on top of that you’re creating stress because you’re body is now having to suck oxygen through something that’s obstructing the airway

We BREATHE oxygen
We need oxygen
We breathe out carbon dioxide
How long would an animal or human last by just breathing carbon dioxide?
Not very long, they need oxygen within a minute and half. Things start to shut off.
In medicine and trauma they’re taught 3 things
“When in doubt go back to your ABCs”
Airway
Breathing
Circulation

When you’re wearing a mask you’re reducing your ability to oxygenate.
Now that you’ve thrown your body into chronic stress, you’re increasing your cortisol levels.
Which is your stress hormone. Cortisol going up suppresses your immune system
You get into something called “Sympathetic mimetic drive”
This is like having a car in park, and stepping on the accelerator

ASK THE QUESTION! Why?
To make us more susceptible?! </COMMENT 8>

<COMMENT 1> Even cov 19 it self got bored hearing and waitting for this alleged vaccine news . </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Theres no need for vaccines. Better do Ozone Therapy as prevention and do not beliefe the lies spread by wiki or so, cause they are all puppets of big pharma.

Take a look at RobertRowenMD, watch ALL Videos there, and You will know the TRUTH </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> hablas español? </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Monkey experiments are of essential importance. Because you can't use virus to challenge the vaccinated people, it's better to do it on monkeys first. Now none of the vaccine candidates shows promising results on this aspect. 
Antibodies in your system help you to response to virus quicker. No result shows that if you are infected once, you are immune to COVID19 </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Keep up your working, we are so proud of your all people science. The world hope for all science to save the world and with jesus christ the son of God. Amen </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> There has never been a successful vaccine for a coronavirus, what makes you all think it will be different this time lol </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Make the world hot </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> The comments on here make it sound like the vaccine is being developed by angels. They're in a race to develop a vaccine to make money €£€£€£€£€£€£€£€£. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Good deed to help will never be unnoticed,,, God Bless you all </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> We CAN’T CURE AIDS, or even the common cold (another Coronavirus), and yet, we’re all eagerly waiting for a CCP VIRUS vaccine that may never come. My money is on ANTIBODY treatments, especially since sick patients may not have the time to benefit from a vaccine stimulating an immune response before the patient dies. Antibody injection SKIPS the “immune response” latency period.
Oh, and I have ZERO CONFIDENCE in the WHO, also known as CHINA’S LAPDOG, to be looking out for the “best interests of the world” at this point. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> I heard that "Haste makes Waste." So rushing to create a vaccine to a virus that isn't even naturally viral to humans is retarded and a waste of our current finances. </COMMENT 11>

<COMMENT 1> And again the MSM including CNBComedy, The Lancent (leftist pseudo research), Harvard, WHO, Universities and so called 'Researchers' lying about Hydroxychloroquin and Trump is correct, IT WORKS ! : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llZ1uurWLmA </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> then why didn't this old fart speak up and speak out when the president kept confusing the public, minimizing the continued threat to the public posed by Covid19, and not using the production act to vastly and rapidly scale up the tens of thousands of testing need DAILY to allow people to get back to their lives? All that's done is that there are insufficient testing, poor examples set by Trump and the government, and everyone is just out there protesting, at the beach, and starting sports again.  With humans, expect a deadly 2nd wave for them to learn the lesson. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> lies </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> All the blame on Donald Trump </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> All vaccine launch timers are at CovidTimer.com. We need no other info now. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> COVID-19 simply sees fresh hosts... </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> CDC diector, you have  very unclear records, and pronostics does not mean facts !!
So , Give proof of what you say, show the names of the people who have died of cov 19 !! </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Trump 2020 </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> As far as my concern, this virus will continue until we don't have special vaccine and this will take longer base in our History. We should always be careful and always wear mask ,wash your hands and try to be polite as much as we can because this is not just a flu or fever but also this is very depressing. God Heal our Land. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> What is he talking about? I see people wearing masks everywhere in Washington DC even when they don’t need to (like walking and biking alone) and the infection rate is dropping in DC but not in Maryland. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> A week ago we had tyrannical mayors & governors threatening to arrest people for gathering at birthday parties, weddings, and at churches. This week those same tyrants are fine with protestors traveling across state lines & gathering in large crowds.
The fact they’re ok with that should tell you one of two things are true. Either they don’t care if protestors get sick & die. Or they know the pandemic isn’t as bad as they’ve made it out to be. Which is it? </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Tell the mayors and governors to stop the protests, where there is NO social distancing. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Is CDC still waiting on the spring breakers and the beach goers to drop dead? </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> So for what logical reason do people think Covid is a hoax and how would whomever benefit from it? To me it seems it would be more beneficial for the people they complain about if everyone did get sick, all those medical bills and vaccine sales due to it being wide spread and not to mention big business gets to continue making money while not having to pay workers for sick leave and stay safely at their vacation homes. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Stfu if the virus is that bad than just keep quiet and let it do its job. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> They big mad nobody wants to hear their bull isht anymore </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Long as trump and his supporters keep running their mouths people will continue to die ! </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Liars </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> If American don't die from the coronavkrus they're going to die from the blue virus </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Hey, listen here CDC director, the democrats are done with this virus. They've declared it to be over. It's now about riots and looters... Oops, I meant "protestors". </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 1> 27:03 "this is part of the cost of globalization" truest words ever spoke. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Peter Covid19 is real but very far from being a pandemic. Check the death Data. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> I thank you for asking the hard questions. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Good to hear two sensible, knowledeable people discussing this. Thank you. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Swedish scientist has said the same. 50 to 60 percent of US population will get it. Lots of had already. And haven't known it. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> No hype, no proclamations, no hyperbole, no agenda. Wonderful video, thanks. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> This is comparing apple to oranges. Nobody has done statistical analysis of the seasonal flu anti-body. The symptoms of COVID19 are much worst than the flu. What can be measure is number of people who must be hospitalized and, out of those, how many die. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> So we have an illness that, even the gentlemen here agree, we have no idea how lethal it is. Rather than take precautionary measures - what the governments have been doing worldwide - they go about questioning it and the impact on economy! Yes economies have suffered, yes people have lost their jobs, but in the absence of lockdowns these could be far worse. Rather have my life than the economy booming and me resting under 6 feet of dirt! </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Thank you for being scientifically honest and not ideologically driven mixed in with fear. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Spot on. Dr Jay certainly hits the mark of what most intelligent people are thinking. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Thank you for honest, intelligent insights/perspectives. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Very interesting discussion. Thank you. But I don't think I'd like to be in the US right now at all. I live in Switzerland and am grateful every day for being here, where the health care is excellent, the laws are functional but not draconian and the whole issue has never become some political controversy polarising the entire nation. It's been dealt with practically and in a manner that the vast majority of the country supports. It's called living in a democracy, and that has not been significantly undermined in this entire process. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Please do some research on Dr Fauchi.  He's on the side of Bill Gates.  He predicted this pandemic a few years ago.  I believe President Trump knows already. And, check out Dr. Raschid Buttar on YouTube. He knows all about covid-19. They are lying a out the figures.
I also heard that if you were vaccinated with the flu shot, n tested for covid, you will test positive.
I hope this helps yall. Thanks for the info. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> The truth is here for everyone to see now. Dr Rashed A Batter has been exposing the lies to covid 19 a must see on the truth. Thank you for this video, you to have questions like us, appreciate that you guys are honest.✋ </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> This video is the most informative piece I have seen - thank you so much for showing this = to both of you...
ALL should watch the follow up Video as well..
I am pretty certain I had COVID in December and did not get tested at that time.  I was buying items from China DIRECT = person to person with a 9 day transit time.  I do believe I had it...  yes, I do... 

I would be more than willing to give plasma to someone that is sick.. however, it seems like a person that "think" they may have had it needs to have proof-positive before they can get considered to donate.. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> thanks for a good  info </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> thanks for this. I also collected all the evidence that they're lying to us about Coronavirus: @ </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> This is one of the best discussion that I have heard.  Thank you.  I have a scientific training and am shocked at how little the intelligentsia know about science in the 21st century.  We need a better basic science education </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> 27:41 Yes, you were reading our minds! Uh... no thanks! </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> This is a conversation ignorant of risk theory. They are both speaking within their fields, but are unable to see outside of them.

Trump: "........China's beating us"

Oh yeah? Don't worry you WILL BEAT them SOON! AS THE COUNTRY THAT HAS MOST DEATHS OF COVID19 IN THE WORLD that is. </COMMENT 8>

If you protect such a man , with whatever reasoning, you might pay for his sins, too, on the day of judgement. I, personally, will stand witness against him.
Do not kid yourselves, Ford and Tory will protect him because he is well-connected. </COMMENT 2>

Stop corruption and the problem gets fixed with more money in the pot serving where it’s intended to go </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Fox News anchors all over this video,  judging by the comments. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> I came back here because this was the last CBC video with the comments turned on. Every one posted since has the comments turned off. You are supposed to be the national broadcaster, CBC. What is the problem with allowing active discourse on your posted videos? This is the last CBC video that I will watch. Considering the level of journalistic integrity in evidence on your news broadcasts over the last decade or so, I don’t think I’m likely to miss much. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> This is all a sham at this point. turdeau is killing the country's economy, millions of job lost, suicides, depression, businesses that will never come back etc... all of that for a virus equivalent to a bad case of seasonal flu. Numbers around the world confirm this. the WHO just confirmed that it's 10x less contagious than their prediction. (wrong since the beginning) and confirmed that a second wave is non existent. Wake up people, this was a false alarm and they knew for a while now. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> The CBC lying for their liberal masters. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> As a health care worker with reduced hours...promises of topping up our pay has still not come to pass.... entering week 12 of severe pay loss while others getting full CERB... ridiculous... </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Its the human way </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> What about cerb for Canadians aftet june.
Is there is any finencal support for Canadian after June 6 2020? </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> This is perfect. I stopped counting at 70. 70 in a row negative comments about our weasel leader and CBC.....so good to see people catching on to these leftist scammers </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> When will the CBC start asking real questions and holding this federal government accountable for all of this massive spending? Where will the money come from? How large is the current deficit with all this covid spending? How much will taxes increase? When will the frderal government stop funding the media and the CBC? </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> The elderly need companionship love from their families more than anything that is their medecine. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> I’M NOT HOMOSEXUAL But Mashallah our PM is a good looking man. I’m not a feminist either but this is where us men need to learn from women. Like bruh.... your tie is more to the right. We men simply don’t pay attention to detail. I just happened to be among those who do but yo ....seriously, I think we should start </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Sounds like instead of puppy mills we have senior mills and I am so glad that they are being addressed and cleaned up </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> PM with good heart </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> What about extra money for the disabled?  It was mentioned briefly then no mention of it since. I live on a pension far lower than any others.  Please update </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 1> This video is super weak. Did you start mailing it in after the 3 millionth subscriber, or the 4 millionth? </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> How about making a minute of the earth on lucid dreams?  I think it will be very cool the subject is interesting </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Thanks! This was super informational </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Presuming you are getting accurate data from other countries. I expect the number of cases in China is at least one magnitude higher. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> @minutephysics, I'm afraid you have a SERIOUS error here. What you are plotting is log(dy/dt) vs. log(y), so a straight line means log(dy/dt) = k*log(y), or dy/dt = y^k. 
Thus, y = exp(integral of y^(k-1)*t). Since k < 1, this is an exponential only in form because as y grows the y^(k-1) term shrinks. If k = 0.5, then by the time there are a million cases, that term is 10^-5 of the value it started out with, assuming that k stayed constant. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> America doesn't seem at all interested in containing this epidemic, especially now with the riots happening. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Let’s go ahead and take Chinese numbers with a whole salt mine full of salt. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Nice 
#ashoksaini </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Make a video answering this question:
Is AI smarter than us? </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> The Philippines is handling this horribly. We don't even know how our curve looks because the government won't conduct mass testing as adequate levels. And we're relaxing quarantine measures (after THREE MONTHS) before we've even seen any evidence that the curve is flattening. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Roses are red violets are blue why does the Karen think covid-19 is just the ordinary flu </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Can you revisit with current data and talk about why so many countries demonstrate exponential decay, but not USA?  I also tried looking at new cases as ppm and displayed not as absolute numbers but rate of change. There appears to be a period "bump" approximately every 7 days.  Is this real or a result of how data is collected? </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> How's india doing ?Plz reply </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Lately, Republicans have been using the Total Cases statistic to argue that blue states have a worse response to this pandemic than red states.
This video beautifully explains why changes in New Cases is the most relevant statistic if we want to talk about a given government's response to this pandemic. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Two months later, and I'm still checking this graph on a daily basis. I've noticed that rather than a flat or smooth curve, my state's version of "leveling out" is a series of dips where the weekly infection rate is between 500 to 600 new cases, and peaks where it's in the upper 700's. That made me wonder: since going out to restock my fridge / pantry is unavoidable, is it safer to go out during a dip or a peak? Are there any epidemiologists who've worked this out with previous infectious diseases? </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Pennsylvania department of health has adopted this graphic animation! </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> And another Indian! </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> The graph (and video) should be modified by doing a log plot of new reported deaths per million versus a log plot of total reported deaths per million.  In the absence of that it is quite misleading and is virtually certain to lead to widespread misunderstanding. </COMMENT 18>

<COMMENT 1> "We live in a country that predominantly values power, dominance and aggression over care, empathy and collaboration and it's not working for us anymore"  That is so true. Wish you were our President, Gavin. As one once said "when you elect a clown, expect a circus"  We cannot survive 4 more years of a clown in the White House. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> How is the investigation going for those Americans who were murdered in those nursing homes in Newsom the clown ???? Suddenly,  I don't hear anything anymore, AND I didn't see ONE protestor about those murders.  🤔🤔🤔  Newsom/ Garsitti the clowns and the cronies who work for these two Fredo's  were quick to condemn and label the protesters at capitol buildings that destroyed NOTHING and just wanted to go back to work. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Hi I have great content on coronavirus go to my channel. Thanks in advanced </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> He says a whole lot of nothing! I bet he practices this garbage in the mirror! GET TO THE POINT OPEN UP OUR ECONOMY AND STAY THE HELL OUT OF IT, AND STOP WITH YOUR TIPPY TOEING UP AND DOWN WITH THIS SNAIL LIKE METHOD OF MADNESS! JUST WAIT TILL THE VOTERS SHOW YOU HOW PATHETIC YOU ARE!!!!!!!! </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Ummmm...maybe you forgot.  It turned out that the virus wasn't like we thought it might be. It's sort of like a nasty flu. It just gets lots of attention because they realized that they can use it to control people. THAT'S the important thing. You know...squash freedom and destroy America. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Cases increasing in California https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mMh_xoNMvI </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Thank you Governor Newsom. Thank you for being 1,000 times smarter and kinder than the President of the United States. I am sorry for being a pain in the lower part when you were you were the Mayor. I will keep supporting you even if you run for President in the next four years. You can call me any time at: 415-503-1432. I will do whatever you ask me to.do. This 69  year old man wishes you good luck. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Good stuff governor Newsome ! Your doing an awesome job ,! Thanks for your hard work ! </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> This will bring more deaths. undoubtedly. You cannot open one part and then have another closed. This virus is like gravity. It will find a way to infect others who are vulnerable and will NOT stop until we get a vaccine. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Since you protesters are out there. Can you guys gather signatures for a recall petition </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Newsom is pretentious tyrant.   He needs to be imprisoned for his nonsense and lies </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> California needs a lockdown </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Dude ...you so inept as a leader....its mind blowing. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Every time I look at a California Governor, I see either a Fruit or a Nut...excluding Reagan! </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Newsome’s way of getting rid of the Homeless!   And the Stench! </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Every time the news covers a state re-opening, the news network attacks it immediately with doom-and-gloom about rising virus cases.  Look for it.  Expect it.  Happens every time.  Disregard it.  We cannot and will not wait for the virus to disappear completely.  Wear a mask, social-distance, and get back to your regular lives. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> You want slavery.....💯.. Do everybody in California a great service and resign You want dependence on the system.. To fuel your pocket and the people that you work for... </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> You suck Gavin....you lie </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> People are protesting.....California needs  Intervention from gavin Newsom ......people are suffering...he's the problem... And all we hear are excuses.. Because his  political ties to certain parties???? If you listen to the question he does not answer about protesting about George Lloyd... </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> You are à horrible governer and I can't wait until your out of office. California will be a better place!! </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 2> There's no second wave over exagerrated cover up </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Watch Peak Prosperity. The Lancet article on hydroxycloraquine was a scam. </COMMENT 3>

<COMMENT 5> IT will look as BAD as the CONTROLLED news MEDIA wants IT to look! </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> It will be worst  and they are protesting in a pandemic </COMMENT 6>

<COMMENT 10> selfish people always Me,Me, Me,Me,Me,Me. Some universities and Small Colleges are eager for money and will open in The fall their campuses under false statements like " we are a small college,we have everything under control " hypocrites you just care about money not the welfare of your faculty and staff. Students goes to college with very poor hygiene habits and don't respect social distance , the students may not get sick but with they lack of strict measurements of keep themselves clean it will repeat. 
US citizens does not believe in COVID-19 neither in a second wave.
They feel untouchable and like nothing will hit them. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> A vaccine , this is my opinion. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> There will be no second wave. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Eating factory farmed animals substantially increases the risk of pandemics. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, “3 out of every 4 new or emerging infectious diseases in people come from animals.” . SARS, a 2003 pandemic that infected people in two dozen countries and killed 774, reportedly originated from a wild animal at a live market in China as well. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> To reduce the risk of pandemics, we must ban factory arms now. Regulating the factory farming industry is not enough to minimize its risks. A total ban is necessary because it expresses that factory farming is deeply harmful to humans, animals, and the environment. </COMMENT 14>

<COMMENT 1> This video is super weak. Did you start mailing it in after the 3 millionth subscriber, or the 4 millionth? </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> How about making a minute of the earth on lucid dreams?  I think it will be very cool the subject is interesting </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Thanks! This was super informational </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Presuming you are getting accurate data from other countries. I expect the number of cases in China is at least one magnitude higher. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> @minutephysics, I'm afraid you have a SERIOUS error here. What you are plotting is log(dy/dt) vs. log(y), so a straight line means log(dy/dt) = k*log(y), or dy/dt = y^k. 
Thus, y = exp(integral of y^(k-1)*t). Since k < 1, this is an exponential only in form because as y grows the y^(k-1) term shrinks. If k = 0.5, then by the time there are a million cases, that term is 10^-5 of the value it started out with, assuming that k stayed constant. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> America doesn't seem at all interested in containing this epidemic, especially now with the riots happening. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Let’s go ahead and take Chinese numbers with a whole salt mine full of salt. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Nice 
#ashoksaini </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Make a video answering this question:
Is AI smarter than us? </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> The Philippines is handling this horribly. We don't even know how our curve looks because the government won't conduct mass testing as adequate levels. And we're relaxing quarantine measures (after THREE MONTHS) before we've even seen any evidence that the curve is flattening. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Roses are red violets are blue why does the Karen think covid-19 is just the ordinary flu </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Can you revisit with current data and talk about why so many countries demonstrate exponential decay, but not USA?  I also tried looking at new cases as ppm and displayed not as absolute numbers but rate of change. There appears to be a period "bump" approximately every 7 days.  Is this real or a result of how data is collected? </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> How's india doing ?Plz reply </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Lately, Republicans have been using the Total Cases statistic to argue that blue states have a worse response to this pandemic than red states.
This video beautifully explains why changes in New Cases is the most relevant statistic if we want to talk about a given government's response to this pandemic. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Two months later, and I'm still checking this graph on a daily basis. I've noticed that rather than a flat or smooth curve, my state's version of "leveling out" is a series of dips where the weekly infection rate is between 500 to 600 new cases, and peaks where it's in the upper 700's. That made me wonder: since going out to restock my fridge / pantry is unavoidable, is it safer to go out during a dip or a peak? Are there any epidemiologists who've worked this out with previous infectious diseases? </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Pennsylvania department of health has adopted this graphic animation! </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> And another Indian! </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> The graph (and video) should be modified by doing a log plot of new reported deaths per million versus a log plot of total reported deaths per million.  In the absence of that it is quite misleading and is virtually certain to lead to widespread misunderstanding. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> I like this a lot.  It seems like a good idea.

But where the heck is the follow-up?

<COMMENT 1> Cbc has the comments on......does not feel right to me, there usually disabled with a ton of down votes. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Looks like Mike Harris did it again . First to the disabled whom he dehoused and stole billions from and now to the elderly. 
If you protect such a man , with whatever reasoning, you might pay for his sins, too, on the day of judgement. I, personally, will stand witness against him.
Do not kid yourselves, Ford and Tory will protect him because he is well-connected. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> WHEN YOU WORSHIP ON SUNDAY PRAY FOR ALL PEOPLE, AND AT THE SAME TIME ASK YOURSELF THIS " WHAT COLOR IS GOD" CAUSE NO ONE CAN PROVE HE ISNT BLACK. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> My hero </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> The provinces stop cutting budgets in sectors so they can funnel that extra tax payer money into construction projects that politicians and organized crime embezzle millions from
Stop corruption and the problem gets fixed with more money in the pot serving where it’s intended to go </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Fox News anchors all over this video,  judging by the comments. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> I came back here because this was the last CBC video with the comments turned on. Every one posted since has the comments turned off. You are supposed to be the national broadcaster, CBC. What is the problem with allowing active discourse on your posted videos? This is the last CBC video that I will watch. Considering the level of journalistic integrity in evidence on your news broadcasts over the last decade or so, I don’t think I’m likely to miss much. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> This is all a sham at this point. turdeau is killing the country's economy, millions of job lost, suicides, depression, businesses that will never come back etc... all of that for a virus equivalent to a bad case of seasonal flu. Numbers around the world confirm this. the WHO just confirmed that it's 10x less contagious than their prediction. (wrong since the beginning) and confirmed that a second wave is non existent. Wake up people, this was a false alarm and they knew for a while now. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> The CBC lying for their liberal masters. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> As a health care worker with reduced hours...promises of topping up our pay has still not come to pass.... entering week 12 of severe pay loss while others getting full CERB... ridiculous... </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Its the human way </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> What about cerb for Canadians aftet june.
Is there is any finencal support for Canadian after June 6 2020? </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> This is perfect. I stopped counting at 70. 70 in a row negative comments about our weasel leader and CBC.....so good to see people catching on to these leftist scammers </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> When will the CBC start asking real questions and holding this federal government accountable for all of this massive spending? Where will the money come from?

<COMMENT 1> "We live in a country that predominantly values power, dominance and aggression over care, empathy and collaboration and it's not working for us anymore"  That is so true. Wish you were our President, Gavin. As one once said "when you elect a clown, expect a circus"  We cannot survive 4 more years of a clown in the White House. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> How is the investigation going for those Americans who were murdered in those nursing homes in Newsom the clown ???? Suddenly,  I don't hear anything anymore, AND I didn't see ONE protestor about those murders.  🤔🤔🤔  Newsom/ Garsitti the clowns and the cronies who work for these two Fredo's  were quick to condemn and label the protesters at capitol buildings that destroyed NOTHING and just wanted to go back to work. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Hi I have great content on coronavirus go to my channel. Thanks in advanced </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> He says a whole lot of nothing! I bet he practices this garbage in the mirror! GET TO THE POINT OPEN UP OUR ECONOMY AND STAY THE HELL OUT OF IT, AND STOP WITH YOUR TIPPY TOEING UP AND DOWN WITH THIS SNAIL LIKE METHOD OF MADNESS! JUST WAIT TILL THE VOTERS SHOW YOU HOW PATHETIC YOU ARE!!!!!!!! </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Ummmm...maybe you forgot.  It turned out that the virus wasn't like we thought it might be. It's sort of like a nasty flu. It just gets lots of attention because they realized that they can use it to control people. THAT'S the important thing. You know...squash freedom and destroy America. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Cases increasing in California https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mMh_xoNMvI </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Thank you Governor Newsom. Thank you for being 1,000 times smarter and kinder than the President of the United States. I am sorry for being a pain in the lower part when you were you were the Mayor. I will keep supporting you even if you run for President in the next four years. You can call me any time at: 415-503-1432. I will do whatever you ask me to.do. This 69  year old man wishes you good luck. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Good stuff governor Newsome ! Your doing an awesome job ,! Thanks for your hard work ! </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> This will bring more deaths. undoubtedly. You cannot open one part and then have another closed. This virus is like gravity. It will find a way to infect others who are vulnerable and will NOT stop until we get a vaccine. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Since you protesters are out there. Can you guys gather signatures for a recall petition </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Newsom is pretentious tyrant.   He needs to be imprisoned for his nonsense and lies </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> California needs a lockdown </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Dude ...you so inept as a leader....its mind blowing. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Every time I look at a California Governor, I see either a Fruit or a Nut...excluding Reagan! </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Newsome’s way of getting rid of the Homeless!   And the Stench! </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Every time the news covers a state re-opening, the news network attacks it immediately with doom-and-gloom about rising virus cases.  Look for it.  Expect it.  Happens every time.  Disregard it.  We cannot and will not wait for the virus to disappear completely.  Wear a mask, social-distance, and get back to your regular lives. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> You want slavery.....💯.. Do everybody in California a great service and resign You want dependence on the system.. To fuel your pocket and the people that you work for... </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> You suck Gavin....you lie </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> People are protesting.....California needs  Intervention from gavin Newsom ......people are suffering...he's the problem... And all we hear are excuses.. Because his  political ties to certain parties???? If you listen to the question he does not answer about protesting about George Lloyd... </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> You are à horrible governer and I can't wait until your out of office. California will be a better place!! </COMMENT 20>

<TIMESTAMP> 2020-05-26T15:34:46Z </TIMESTAMP>
<DESCRIPTION> Sweden is among the countries that have opted against a lockdown and instead gone for voluntariness when it comes to measures against spreading covid-19. </DESCRIPTION>
<TAGS> ['immunity', 'anitbodies', 'coronavirus immunity', 'coronavirus', 'corona sweden', 'coronavirus sweden', 'coronavirus antibodies', 'corona vaccine', 'herd immunity', 'coronavirus vaccine', 'coronavirus therapy', 'coronavirus treatment coronavirus', 'corona virus', 'virus outbreak', 'corona', 'coronavirus outbreak', 'virus', 'corona virus vaccine', 'coronavirus quarantine', 'coronavirus explain', 'coronavirus explained', 'coronavirus explainer'] </TAGS>
<COMMENT 1> As always, we'd love to include your questions in our upcoming shows! What would you like to know about the coronavirus pandemic? #askDerrick </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> The people who love to tout "herd immunity" most likely have no idea how it actually works, and are very unlikely to bother learning how it works. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Is the corona going to peter out like sars 1 and mers ? </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Swedish model failed. Period. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> we can not call doing nothing  as a  "model" tho AXD </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> DE News seems to criticise every country in the world bar Germany. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> So if having covid 19 doesn't furnish immunity how could a vaccine? This video has a major flaw. This antibody theory with testing w respect to covid must also be flawed as well. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> No more information on the number of "active cases" and "total recovered" in Worldmeter website.  So Sweden joins UK and Netherlands.  This may be the sign of thing out of control and don't want to report. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> We are learning more about this virus everyday but for those who trying to downplay the seriousness of this disease I think they are being foolish. We will never really the real death toll because most countries were not prepared for this. By 5he time that we have this virus virus figured out we will have another virus to worry about </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Is it anybody responsible for the death of so many people in the last few weeks? Or is not such a thing as responsability.... only power to decide over other people's lives or death? </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> That's the question. 2200 new confirmed cases today. Looks like their turn is near. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> LET US START FROM  THIS QUESTION >>>>WHY DID NATIONAL INSTITUTE  OF HEALTH  (NIH)  IN THE UNITED STATES FUND  THE EXPERIMENT  THAT CREATED SARS COV 2 (COVID 12)  AT  THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA IN 2015.. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> yes big time fail. sweden=idiots </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> THE VACCINES  AND DIGITAL ID AGENDA IS THE REASON  WE HAVE THIS CORONA VIRUS MADNESS AS  CREATED BY  THE MEDIA </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> DW  IS  DOING THE BIDDING OF BILL GATES....DW IS BEHIND  THE  AGENDA  OF KLAUS SHWAUB AND BILL GATES </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> What about when we creat covid 20 </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> The problem with numbers  are what numbers are we talking about.  Sweden had a issue with care homes and the poor to my knowledge. So to get a handle on their approach is to see how did it work with the general public.
Another thing never really talked about is, What is the cost of the lockdown?  The lockdown wasn't to save lives only, but to stop the hospitals from being overwhelmed.  By doing that we can save more people, face it people are going to die. The weak and the old are going to die,  believe me I think that sucks, since I am 65. Viruses get people sick, deadly viruses kill. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Vi är så jävla efterblivna... </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> As long as the COVID-19 death toll in Sweden is less than that of the United States it should be fine. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Does anyone here have any idea if it was only Pres. Trump that said Chloroquine will help against Covid-19 virus or is there a scientific basis on this? </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 1> I love how she says we don’t have the technology to microchip people xD </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> I have heard from a few sources that the US Army believes they will have some type of vaccine by the end of 2020.    Anyone else have any information on that?   I’m from a military family  but none of us are Doctors or researchers.  My son is active duty with 2 deployments and now  JAG attorney.    No experts on this in my family. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Wow.  A channel with a smart and educated audience.  Aka not too many red state Fox fed trump,twats </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Excellent content. I’ve been researching this virus and I’m really looking forward to results of the many rct’s. To me, Tocilizumab and Convalescent Plasma Transfusion seem like the more effective treatments out there, but I have only recently realized the extent of endothelial involvement </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57CSfTR34d0 </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> I have a question.  Why can't you just test say people entering the country instead of quarantine them.  So if they don't test positive then let them go? </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Dr Seheult, you are also our hero. Thank you for educating us (healthcare).. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Marvelous. I will be listening again. It was very comprehensive. So much good information to help me to help myself. I had a lot of blood vessel damage during  brain surgery, twice
Just glad that you Explained how that works thank you. I'd like to know how it affects someone whose eyes are weak do to a brain tumor. And how the virus affects the brain.
Thank you so much for your presentation it's exactly what I was looking for. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> There's a lot of big words that someone who doesn't know all the words could miss chunks of meaning from this video... Thrombosis is the thing I am most unsure about, I do know of deep vein thrombosis so assumed that section of the video was saying a lot of people with covid19 will have plaque forming inside their veins because that's what happens with deep vein thrombosis.

The picture with the fat man and the skinny man was very easy to understand but It does make it look worse for fat people than in reality. If skinny people still get struck down by covid19 then as a fat person I sure feel like I don't need to panic and start running down the hallway and spam into the wall...

I like that you guys know what minor tweaks could be done to improve a person's chances like which vitamins they should be having and hot cold treatment however can a patient be sure that no matter which medical hospital they go to in the world that those doctors will also care and know this? Also how many saunas are in hospitals to be able to try hot cold? Should everyone be trying hot cold for the common cold or flu? Seems to me like hot cold seems to be a general treatment that's good like how it's good for a person to be face down to improve their breathing when there's phlegm. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> One question 
As far as I understand nobody have isolated Covid19 Virus. 
Is the Good Dr talking about Covid in general ? </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Lose weight. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Great initiative by MedCram team👌 </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> See why we should END WAGE SLAVERY? See now? It’s insane because no one can work for 2-4-24 months or TEN YEARS ++? See? </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> As someone that knows Nothing about Molecular Biology or Medicine, and being frustrated by the widespread superficiality of media presentations and details I was very intrigued and interested to hear you speak on the virus, and the medicinal practices and details associated with it. I feel I have a greatly improved framework to understand what is going on around me that has caused the globe to come to a violent halt. I appreciate your time and look forward to more of your videos, thanks for your expertise and introducing me to a new world of ideas, terms and in-depth perspective. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> *STUPID QUESTION: DO ANTIHISTAMINES SUPPRESS INNATE IMMUNITY?*
It's spring and I cannot function without antihistamines.  This year, Diphenhydramine, is my preferred solution because the once a day pills don't carry me beyond 5 hours.  
I only need these from Feb through July. Am I (male 53 with no other comorbidity) at a potentially increased risk? </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> https://www.deccanherald.com/science-and-environment/zinc-hydroxychloroquine-found-effective-in-some-covid-19-patients-study-836561.html spread the word trump might be right! </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> The PROBLEM with the VA study: The one's who got the drug were further along on the virus than the one's who didn't. In other words they were much sicker. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> @MedCram, why were several of your COVID lessons removed?  You provide great, objective information. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Great hosting lol from Ireland </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 1> Chris Como you're a pussy </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> the stats are abundantly clear : if you are not 70 or greater in a nursing home or hospice  with dementia , heart and kidney failure or  end stage cancer you have little to fear except fear itself. Despite the media hysterics and very misleading misrepresentations for the vast majority its no bigger threat than the seasonal flu. All this lockdown BS is completely unverified pulled out the ass BS to appease the ignorant and cowardly . </COMMENT 2>

Don't get me wrong, I'm glad they don't-- they would experience massive backlash ala STREISAND EFFECT if they tried. But it seems like a bitch move they would attempt, lol.

<COMMENT 1> I don’t want it on my bday, it is what it is !! It’s not our fault! It will just be sad if it’s not over in the summer </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Did this used to be crash course? </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> I found out how to get rid of Sars... Just get the bolsheviks! </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Outside temp: 108
Daily cases in my state: 1,100+ surpassing even New York
That would be a big fat *NO* </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Its not going away for 5 plus years. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> What </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> So you think your mask matters. MOSQUITO. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Trump this it will. Magically.  The only question is...........will Trump go away in this summer? </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Singapore say no. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> no. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> I’m in Miami. And Miami has the most cases by A LOT in the whole Florida and it’s always humid down here </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> India it is  increasing though is summer </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> I Hope To Stay Healthy Until COVID-19 Go Away This Summer! </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> I really want covid19 to end and this year is ruining my life and it’s so ridiculous that I have been quarantined for months and now it needs to end and otherwise doing online school again next year and it’s ok maybe 2021 will be better and shouldn’t lie to trumps ideas </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> I feel like it would be the same as February </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Pollution is the problem, Wuhan, Milan, New York now Rio and the worst hit the poorer areas. Smokers also have a bigger problem people's respiratory systems are already compromised with pollution. The possible cause that children are far less affected and the more affluent people like Prince Charles survive it. Early intervention, proper diet and good vitamin levels in the body will beat the virus. The rural areas of the USA are also doing fine, the same where I live in Australia. Another case in point after the lock down in various places infections quickly subsided result of cleaner air meant less transmissions. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Idk where anyone else is, but Summer's here where I'm at already, and I have Covid19 </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> The globalist movement brought us the Covid hysteria and will also decide when it goes away. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Covid 19 won't go away but might die down just a tiny bit </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 1> I love how she says we don’t have the technology to microchip people xD </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> I have heard from a few sources that the US Army believes they will have some type of vaccine by the end of 2020.    Anyone else have any information on that?   I’m from a military family  but none of us are Doctors or researchers.  My son is active duty with 2 deployments and now  JAG attorney.    No experts on this in my family. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Wow.  A channel with a smart and educated audience.  Aka not too many red state Fox fed trump,twats </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Excellent content. I’ve been researching this virus and I’m really looking forward to results of the many rct’s. To me, Tocilizumab and Convalescent Plasma Transfusion seem like the more effective treatments out there, but I have only recently realized the extent of endothelial involvement </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57CSfTR34d0 </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> I have a question.  Why can't you just test say people entering the country instead of quarantine them.  So if they don't test positive then let them go? </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Dr Seheult, you are also our hero. Thank you for educating us (healthcare).. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Marvelous. I will be listening again. It was very comprehensive. So much good information to help me to help myself. I had a lot of blood vessel damage during  brain surgery, twice
Just glad that you Explained how that works thank you. I'd like to know how it affects someone whose eyes are weak do to a brain tumor. And how the virus affects the brain.
Thank you so much for your presentation it's exactly what I was looking for. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> There's a lot of big words that someone who doesn't know all the words could miss chunks of meaning from this video... Thrombosis is the thing I am most unsure about, I do know of deep vein thrombosis so assumed that section of the video was saying a lot of people with covid19 will have plaque forming inside their veins because that's what happens with deep vein thrombosis.

The picture with the fat man and the skinny man was very easy to understand but It does make it look worse for fat people than in reality. If skinny people still get struck down by covid19 then as a fat person I sure feel like I don't need to panic and start running down the hallway and spam into the wall...

I like that you guys know what minor tweaks could be done to improve a person's chances like which vitamins they should be having and hot cold treatment however can a patient be sure that no matter which medical hospital they go to in the world that those doctors will also care and know this? Also how many saunas are in hospitals to be able to try hot cold? Should everyone be trying hot cold for the common cold or flu? Seems to me like hot cold seems to be a general treatment that's good like how it's good for a person to be face down to improve their breathing when there's phlegm. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> One question 
As far as I understand nobody have isolated Covid19 Virus. 
Is the Good Dr talking about Covid in general ? </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Lose weight. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Great initiative by MedCram team👌 </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> See why we should END WAGE SLAVERY? See now? It’s insane because no one can work for 2-4-24 months or TEN YEARS ++? See? </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> As someone that knows Nothing about Molecular Biology or Medicine, and being frustrated by the widespread superficiality of media presentations and details I was very intrigued and interested to hear you speak on the virus, and the medicinal practices and details associated with it. I feel I have a greatly improved framework to understand what is going on around me that has caused the globe to come to a violent halt. I appreciate your time and look forward to more of your videos, thanks for your expertise and introducing me to a new world of ideas, terms and in-depth perspective. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> *STUPID QUESTION: DO ANTIHISTAMINES SUPPRESS INNATE IMMUNITY?*
It's spring and I cannot function without antihistamines.  This year, Diphenhydramine, is my preferred solution because the once a day pills don't carry me beyond 5 hours.  
I only need these from Feb through July. Am I (male 53 with no other comorbidity) at a potentially increased risk? </COMMENT 15>

<COMMENT 17> The PROBLEM with the VA study: The one's who got the drug were further along on the virus than the one's who didn't. In other words they were much sicker. </COMMENT 17>

<COMMENT 8> Il faut bien savoir que ce bouffon vous donne des chiffres complètement faux. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Le confinement a du sens à la seule et unique condition que pendant cette période, l’état augmente considérablement les capacités des hôpitaux quitte à créer des hôpitaux de campagne par régions. Le déconfinement pourra alors être fait au niveau national pour que les gens s’auto -immunisent et ceux qui ne réussiront pas à s’auto-immuniser, les hôpitaux seront alors structurés et prêts à les recevoir en nombre.
Si les moyens des hôpitaux ne sont pas augmentés, les contagions reprendront de plus belle car il n’y a aucune raison que le virus s’arrête par enchantement.
Mettons-nous au travail pour construire ces hôpitaux de campagne. Les citoyens seront volontaires pour apporter leur aides. </COMMENT 9>

<COMMENT 15> *les questions sont filtrées et validées en amont... Du coup rien sur la chloroquine et aucune critique sur la présentation : cacher que la France est devenue le 3eme pays au monde avec le plus de morts, en ne comptabilisant pas les 884 morts des EHPAD.*

*Très malhonnête, pourtant il suffit de faire la somme des chiffres présentés ici même pour voir que la France a plus de morts qu'aux États-Unis, soit disant "pays le plus touché au monde"...*

*Facile de se croire moins touché, il suffit de moins tester ! Voilà pourquoi les seules comparaisons sérieuses doivent porter sur les morts, plus durs à cacher, quoique la France se débrouille pas mal avec les morts des EHPAD  sous le tapis...* </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> *4 503 décès à l'hôpital + 884 en EHPAD ça fait 5 387 morts en France, plus que les  5148 décès aux États-Unis ! POURQUOI MENT IL ? LA FRANCE EST NUMÉRO 3 MONDIAL EN TERME DE DÉCÈS AU COVID 19 !* </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> 😙 juste  1   QUESTION?     et on   fait comment? Pour tuer le  virus .     ?????       Confinement  ou non . Le virus , lui,il circule . </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> 😙  C' est les dossiers de l' écran.  Et les chiffres et les lettres. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Pour nous les tiermondistes ça se comprend , vous les développés c est une honte. 
Vous êtes forts uniquement contre les faibles. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> C'est sûr, la communication est longue et laborieuse, mais comment en faire l'économie ? Quand je vois les commentaires, je suis désespérée...Vous préféreriez une communication à la Trump ?? Ah, oui, on rigolerait plus !!!
Nos dirigeants politiques sont aussi sur le pont, nous donnent des informations très complètes et de manière empathique...La critique est facile sur son canapé et devant les écrans... </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 1> Is it ok to take Acetylcysteine Effervescent tabs everyday? And It's hard to find vitamin D here in my country for affordable price, so does  getting sunlight in the morning at my terrace will do the same thing as taking vitamin d supp?

I have Covid-19 with mild symptoms. And at home quarantine. 

Thanks for the answers and concerns. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> DrSehault, Where do you have time to update....while you are so busy? </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Interviewer is superb...to the point </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> God bless DrSehault 😊 </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Amazing....during this crisis people focusing on research also...God bless the researchers 🙏 </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Very useful and informative 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> As Dr. Seheult talks about having his Vitamin D level checked - please make sure to STOP taking Vitamin D supplements AT LEAST 3 DAYS before having a blood sample taken. Otherwise the determined values are not realistic (actual values can be much lower). </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> We sweap it under the rag same as HIV. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Would you care to share your thoughts on what I believe to be the Solution to COVID-19 --here's the link to my video: https://youtu.be/WSBVpGjyP8k </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Thank you. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Dr Seheult should know that instead of swallowing vitamin D pills it's best to get vitamin D from foods like cod liver, sardines, salmon, herrings, and  butter made from the milk of grass-fed cows.  And sunshine of course. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> I don't understand how someone can 'test positive' for a test that is triggered by any corona virus exposure, for example, your last flu shot, OK, so that means you have or HAVE HAD a corona virus, what does that have to do with CoVid? Then now you test 'negative', which means you don't have and have never had a corona virus. 
Or have they upgraded the virus test to specifically ACE-2 receptor and how do you then test for 'immunity'? I think the medical industry is slinging a lot of hash here. There doesn't seem to be any double-blind testing of these tests on confirmed by bio-assay CoVid victims. For example, test dying CoVid patients on ventilators and determine the margin of error for HAVING the disease, but how does that translate to this imaginary 'immunity' thing. 
The only test I know of is 'you have been exposed to' test, not an immunity test, other than TB tine test, which tests if you are actively fighting TB infection. Have not seen ANY discussion ANYWHERE about the veracity of these tests. Also 'herd immunity' has always been 92% to 95% immune, now suddenly they're slinging the '80% is herd immunity' hash, which would mean for USA  3,000,000 dead (at 1%) plus 4,000,000 dead _just among Seniors!_ (at 10%) 7,000,000 dead? That's insane. What Einstein suggested 'herd immunity'? </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> I hope you will do an update on the results of the U of Minnesota Hydroxycloroquine study.    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32492293/?from_term=boulware+d&from_sort=date&from_pos=1   I was disappointed that it didn't prove effective. I know from your earlier videos, that it requires zinc ions to stop the replication of the virus' RNA. So my question is, why didn't they require the use of zinc as part of the study? I also wonder why they didn't study the severity of virus effects in the two control groups? Even if similar percentages ended up infected, if the one group fared much better, that would be important to know.  Can you please do an update and comment on those two questions? </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Fascinating, thanks! </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Looks like HCQ is back on after the integrity of the data is called into question. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> would a patient with von Willebrands disease avoid NAC? </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> two hospital protocols that include early and constant anticoagulation (and some of the stuff we talk about here):

im trying to figure out a way to organize the pantheon of paper links in some evolving postable linkable way.... </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> I have read studies on the affect of N-acetyl cysteine in relationship to pulmonary hypertension. The studies have contradicted themselves, with some showing (in rats) that it increases PH, while in others it is suggested that NAC may be a treatment for PH.

I am currently supplementing with NAC and have hypertension. I started on this supplementation after viewing your videos on COVID 19. 

Could you please clarify this NAC PH connection? Perhaps you can address this in one of your videos. 

Thank you very much. </COMMENT 18>

<COMMENT 7> All I can think of is let the dead take care of the Dead. 
     I guess it's nice to remember them and honor them but everyone is going to die including you you who are reading this. Get used to it. 
   To get maudlin about it and dwell on it is interfering with the dead. Let them move on to the afterlife without calling them back with sorrowful memories, regret, fear,  loathing and whatever else. Let the dead take care of the dead.
      Life is for the living. We need to move forward. We cannot kill ourselves in the process of fearing death. 

    We don't all drive 5 miles an hour because sometimes there's a car accident. 

    We don't lock down the world because there's Coronavirus with a little over a 2% mortality rate if you're under 65 and over 12% mortality rate if you're over 65. 
     I am not going to vote to destroy an economy so somebody can live another 2 to 5 years on average.     Everyone dies eventually and that's reality.  Not trying to be mean or cruel, just get real about it. 
      Don't guilt the dying for dying. It's normal, natural, healthy process of life. Yes I said it healthy. What's not healthy is stringing somebody out with all kinds of treatments so they can live another 6 months in a horrible condition when they should have died months ago.  
      We should celebrate a life not be maudlin about it. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> People still thinking covid-19 is fake. I hope they'll finally know soon when the death toll will reach 1m. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Thank fuck I live in Australia </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> R.I.P. who those lost their lives from covid-19. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> I'm reaching out to people in my community who might be having a difficult time coping with the current health pandemic. As one of Jehovah's witnesses I try to do some volunteer work each week for my neighbours. This week I thought I might share some good news from the Bible that fits the situation. We can always use some good news can't we?  

Did you know the Bible promises a time when we won't have to fear sickness?

(Read) (Revelation 21:4, 5) 4 And he (God) will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore. The former things have passed away.” 5 And the One seated on the throne said: “Look! I am making all things new.” Also he says: “Write, for these words are faithful and true.”

It's nice to know we have a hope for the future. But how do we cope with the problem right now? I've found an excellent article on a website that helps us to protect ourselves from disease.  

(Download the on line article  “Protect Yourself From Disease” that is currently featured on jw.org.)

<COMMENT 17> Armageddon is here and I feel fine. It's the end of the fucken world. But I'll say this much if I was God or whatever the fuck is out there with the higher power I'd snap my fingers and make the entire planet explode. You all are worthless trash </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Those precious lives. I read one gentleman said never underestimate this different virus before his death. The death is the first thing we have to stop.
To do that we need Avigan. To high risk people within 3 days and to normal people within 6 days on clear symptoms. For your quick info, please check: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJ9GP3TWMqc&t=1s </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> "new normal" is a term in Indonesia set by the government, so we should keep maintaining health protocols by keeping a distance, wearing masks, and always washing hands, hopefully it can be useful and ready to coexist with Covid-19, hopefully this outbreak will soon pass and vaccine quickly found, amen </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 11> you don't get coronavirus if you don't get tested. Tests are faulty, ANYONE who dies be it cancer or heart disease they put covid-19. People are dying because they don't get the necessary treatments as they only accept "covid-19" patients. Tracing is ridiculous! suppose you're told to self isolate for 14 days, then you come out healthy get in close proximity with someone with "covid-19" again then you self isolate again...? this is absurd, and who is gonna pay the salary. Wake up people </COMMENT 11>

<DESCRIPTION> America has the highest number of #COVID19 infections and deaths in the world. Why was its response to the global pandemic too late and too little? </DESCRIPTION>
<TAGS> ['CNA Insider', 'Channel NewsAsia', 'People stories', 'Asian perspectives'] </TAGS>
<COMMENT 1> Who is suffering the worst----the politicians---the establishment---the poor----the rich!? Just asking! </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> It hit you before you knew it was </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> He blames every one, to deflect from his 12 yr.old mind </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> mask need </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Why singaporean news channel covering the failing of US president? Why don't u look at your own government first? Oh wait, u're too afraid to criticize Singapore government! hahaha... </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> American leaders is at fault but they put the blame to WHO and China! They acted to too late. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Spoiled Brat it is, . . . Too much liberty realy kills, . . . We have a saying, that all that is prohibited is addictive😂😂😂😂 " liberty" </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> New York Times are FAKE NEWS. They didn't report President Trump want to stop people coming in to USA but the Democrats ignored it. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> In Taiwan, the first case was detected early and President Tsai Ing-wen immediately consulted her team of top infectious disease experts and together, using what they learned from the SARS epidemic, they initiated a sophisticated program of banning flights from Wuhan, testing, tracking, tracing and isolation and, with the cooperation of the Taiwanese people, the dragon was slain!
     And what did Trump do with his OWN team of experts? 
     He disbanded them.
     Why?
     Because they'd been assembled by Barack Obama and he didn't like that. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Don't worry America. Malaysia will keep selling you medical gloves. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Like anything else from China be it trade , "war" or whatever.... trump think it's a walk in the park .....he is half right, but the park is where they're burying the dead (american) from covid-19, they now have to find places to bury black African American inflicted by the white supremacist police ! Pse don't give any advice on how Hong Kong should be rule ! </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> 😞😞😞 We have been following this pandemic since December, when the pandemic was still in China before it broke out into Europe. By which time the government and the people here, who has families in both Europe and China, started to get worried and probably (hopefully) started discussions and pre actions in order to try and get ahead of this before it could break out here. And since this pandemic started spreading over the Christmas, New Year and Chinese New Year period, where we witness the most heaviest travel period in the world, of course it is going to break out. If Trump’s acted sooner with The Playbook and had not cut funding for Infectious Diseases Control in Asia and had he not pulled out of the Paris Accords, which by the way including medicines and equipment buying and selling, And not taken down Obamacare, which might alleviate their constituents from paying too much  on hospital and doctors bills, I very highly doubt that you would have suffered such high casualties than you already have. Look at our country Australia and look at our casualty rates. Stark contrast to yours. Mr Trump I applaud you 👏👏 very well done sir 👍 Well done. This is your legacy. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> US values politics more than lives. So it's obvious its government urge people to die to save the workable. </COMMENT 13>

Karma. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Correct! Presidential incompetence! Trump​ bungled​ response​ to​ Covid19.​ Now​ he​ is​ blaming every​one​ but​ himself! </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> America idiot </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> as what I've observed, the more tests the country has done... the more cases they have. Same as India who raised their testing capacity now having high number of cases. That's just how it works knowing that US has the highest num. of tests in the world with over 17M tests already </COMMENT 17>

<COMMENT 5> I don't think these guys could talk if you tied there hands behind there back </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Great presentation. One last aspect, caveat. Llama protein is ‘foreign’ to our immune system and could therefore lead to an immune response against it, similar to a human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) immune response. Could that be a HAMA - Llama? I feel I now need to add, ding dong, to the end of that! </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> ¡¡¡CUIDADO LLAMAS!!! </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Brilliant. </COMMENT 8>

<COMMENT 15> Yay, Winter!! </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Biotech blows my mind. How did researchers know they could use bacteria to produce long chain proteins? It’s fascinating. Wished sometimes I choose a career path in the medical research field. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> people actually believe llamas can help them ? 😂 </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Seems cool but impractical.  We already know how to make vaccines.  Because SARS-COV-2 doesn't kill everyone it infects, the human immune system seems adequate at dealing with it. The llama antibody treatment probably won't be ready before the ones in development are ready. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Lamas with antibodies is better than a madman with a Twitter account! TRUMP LIED, PEOPLE DIED!! </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 12> man these hicks sure aren't as slick as them city fellers. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Those flimsy mask don't help at all. Yeah right, a mask can help us.  Better quality masks and all-health professionals still get COVID19. Question everything, why aren't they pushing for hand washing instead of mask wearing.  Think of the symbolism of a covered mouth. We all come with an expiration date and there is nothing we can do about it.  I stand behind the people of this state. They are far from stupid. </COMMENT 13>

<COMMENT 1> Fiona Barnett in Australia is one of many many who came out with her book 4 years ago about her abuse since childhood by these pedophiles triangle. She was raped by Nixon and saw horrible things, how babies were eaten and they drank the blood. Children were burned in big ovens alive.  Fiona thought she would be next, but they didn't take her, only let her watch it. It made her really frighten and more compliant, scared for her life. She has spoken to Police and reported them all, but still not sure anything really been done about it. This is how powerful they are.  God Save Us All. 💙🙏 </COMMENT 1>

<COMMENT 6> I think it is a virus created or modified by China along Russia and maybe North Korea with the intention of weakening the US and Nato members economy, population and moral (notice there being more number of deaths and infected in the US alone then in China which holds about 1/5 of the world population 🤔)  and when the timing is best  there will soon  be an attack on US and Nato members in which the world has never seen, this will be the beginning of WW3 a fast war  but with the worst damage and most numbers of deaths the world will change and it will be a defining moment in world history. </COMMENT 6>

<COMMENT 4> I don’t know about the corona virus but your breathing tech has helped me in many other ways, so thank you </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Thank you Mr. Hof your method has helped me with my pollen/humidity allergies. My nostrils have gotten rid of congestion little by little and I am now able to breathe and feel much better 🙇‍♀️ </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> So why not make your course affordable to everyone? Even at 50% off it's $140. By now it must have paid for itself and then some. This is the only contradiction i see, but it's a big one. We need you, Wim. Be Love </COMMENT 6>

<COMMENT 2> Take care of our seniors and let the rest of us work. I'm so tired of hearing what you've done in the past OMG can you not see what is happening to our country. Trudeau has shut down parliament to avoid accountability and you Doug Ford repeat same old same old continually, tell us something we don't know. Trudeau and his gang of goons think protests  are just fine in fact they allow these paid activists to riot and loot, we have not been different in Canada look at the blockades and what happened in Vancouver and what is happening in Montreal right now, get with it Doug it's happening, </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Resign Ford. You have no idea what you and you're team are doing! - Grossly incompetent </COMMENT 3>

<COMMENT 5> I learned Canada is such a weak country that can’t deal with the virus. The only solution they have is to shut down the small businesses when other stupid people are having their picnic outside like there is no virus. It seems like you guys don’t give a damn or understand the people who can’t work right now. Just look at the country that successfully contained a virus without even a lockdown and follow them since you guys can’t do shit by yourselves. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> You’re standing behind us but our businesses are closing. Botox is cosmetic and that’s allowed before hair salons?!?!  There is going to be a second wave anyway. Are we going to stand up and fight or stay hiding?!?!🤬. Open us uppppp now Ford!!!! </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> I am truly amazed by his leadership during this crisis!!! I am extremely to the left of center. However, I will vote for Ford for PM in a heart beat! </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> I agree with you, all our merchandise should be MADE in CANADA! </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Doug, you are either an ignorant IDIOT or you are CORRUPT, end of! </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Doug, you are a complete FRAUD, In my opinion! </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> “There are three types of lies -- lies, damn lies, and statistics.” </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> For the average person, wearing a mask and using other PPE is by far the most effective way. How to test your mask at home？ https://youtu.be/_BBQRlY-lhE </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> stop saying the future is uncertain and do something about it and let us out you idiots </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Yes, we must unite.not like USA something  may bad happen. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Blah blah blah blah.
I can't with this anymore. Such bullshit. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Doug Ford, you are ignoring all the scientific information confirming the lockdown needs to end now! </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Mr Ford bless your heart for really thinking and believing that there isn’t a severe level of racism in this country....you represent the majority of Canadians who think this way while many minorities suffer. Please speak to your black community before being so proud of your province or even your country. </COMMENT 17>

<COMMENT 1> Put your stethescope away, you melon!!  High infection rates means  swathes of health workers can be kept in quaruntine at home,  This serves 2 purposes,  1) Quarantined staff don't get to see how quiet it is in the hospitals and clinics,  2)  the workers left on duty get a disproportionate sense of chaos and being 'busy',  in the few units actually taking on patients,   Most health care workers now enjoy a media induced public glorification into celebraty status,   They've been elevated from lowly health workers to heroic front line martyrs,  Therefore they simply do not want to see the scam playing out right infront of their noses, which is easily identified by the application of simple scientific process and common sense,  and actually add their own personal style of melodramatics to the process instead of carrying out proper medical and scientific research into virology, epidemeology, and immunology, </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Stupidity 😱😱😱😱😡💉💉💉😬🤭 </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Wow. Or he is mostly wrong.  It is the PPE combined with physical mental and emotional exhaustion from 12+ hour shifts surrounded by an incredible amount of electromagnetic radiation without access to fresh air and sunlight in an atmosphere of complete and total fear, along with a poor diet that is causing the high rate of sickness in healthcare workers. At one point General Practitioners in the US had an average life expectancy of 58 years when for the general population it was around 70 years.  Modern medicine is just that modern ie. inexperienced and unproven.  You would never seek out a healthcare provider who was fresh out of school or residency.   Instead a reasonable person would seek out someone who had 10, 15, or even 20 years of experience.  We have been brainwashed into thinking modern medicine that is only a couple hundred years old has all the answers when traditional medicines with thousands of years of proven success are being marginalized as complimentary.  Don't forget how many things modern medicine has gotten wrong.  Smoking, cholesterol along with all the withdrawn drugs and vaccines that have killed so many people needlessly because pharmaceutical corporations hospitals and doctors just wanted to make a profit.  Research Claude Bernard and Antoine Bechamp and terrain theory.  Even Louis Pasteur admitted that his germ theory was incorrect.  If you are healthy take off your mask, get exposed so that you develop natural immunity and we will all eventually benefit from herd immunity.  Wake up! Rise up! </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> She, " wishes everyone could go to University".   Darlin,  they didn't  cover FAKE  PANDEMICS,  and  they didn't cover "Panic Demics,  like this  one  the  Main Stream media is trying to sell".  Also  the masks you are panicking people about actually concentrate the virus for those heath care workers.     Ex;  Patient coughs,  Virus enters Nurses airway via  air flow around the mask.  The next time the nurse exhales ( about 14 to 16 times per minute average),  She retains some of the virus in the mask.  The mask to some degree is  a REBREATHER  MASK.  There are videos out there that you can watch,  or in the case of "Masks and the Rebreather effect",  they did cover that at my university. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> They never were able to take a picture of a real or living virus, because it's to small. However anyone could see the holes in a face mask with a microscope.
The particles shown as the virus are in fact inclusions in a cell that will fight the virus. There was no difference to see between inside and outside particles with electron microscope.
No mask will give you 100% protection against a virus. Besides, it never fits properly and that's another reason it won't be sufficient.
Damp masks collect all kinds of viruses and bacteria, fungi etc.and are therefore very unhealthy. In fact, it increases the danger of infection. They are breeding facilities of microorganisms.
Your breath contains about 99% humidity saturated air. Do you think that a mask would stop that? Take a cold winter and people with shawls. Their breath becomes visible over more than 2 meters. That is because of condensation of the watery particles in your breath. Sneezing will spread these particles over 5 to 10 meters (even 50). Sneezing through a mask blows the mask off. At least enough to spread the particles. There is no way a mask could prevent you or others. Wearing a mask for several minutes will result in a damp mask with zero effect to reducing viruses.
Sneezing will disperse the collected viruses on the mask in the air. I think it's more a placebo effect. Belongs to the scare porn mass psychology of Covid doomsday.
There is a video showing laserbeams and particles in the air by sneezing. However these viruses can't be shown. The particles which fly far are very small. to small to be visualised.
That's why it's fake to show sneezing trough a mask because it will only disperse the smaller ones into invisible particles. The smaller the holes in a mask the more dispersion.
The most silly approach to sickness is to stay home. Open air and sunlight was always the best way to get healthy. Lockdown is a kind of middle age or Victorian nonsense with curtains closed to keep the evil away. Imagen your locked up with Covid infected people. That's probably why they isolated the elderly to get rid of them.  In Belgium 80 elderly started a lawsuit to the state of deliberately killing the elderly by Opiates and dehydration. </COMMENT 5>

<COMMENT 10> Virus PLandemic or Epidemic in history.  Kids are getting sick now because of wearing masks and elderly why most deaths in nursing homes.

The 2nd wave co2 rebreathing

So okay, there's no proof that it works, but it can't hurt, right? WRONG.

Now that we have established that there is no scientific evidence necessitating the wearing of a face mask for prevention, are there dangers to wearing a face mask, especially for long periods? Several studies have indeed found significant problems with wearing such a mask. This can vary from headaches, to increased airway resistance, carbon dioxide accumulation, to hypoxia, all the way to serious life-threatening complications....While most agree that the N95 mask can cause significant hypoxia and hypercapnia, another study of surgical masks found significant reductions in blood oxygen as well....The importance of these findings is that a drop in oxygen levels (hypoxia) is associated with an impairment in immunity. Studies have shown that hypoxia can inhibit the type of main immune cells used to fight viral infections... This sets the stage for contracting any infection, including COVID-19 and making the consequences of that infection much graver. In essence, your mask may very well put you at an increased risk of infections and if so, having a much worse outcome.

Read that carefully. No known scientific evidence that face masks will prevent transmission... but there is scientific evidence that wearing masks can cause harm. The dangers of carbon dioxide poisoning was discussed in the Dr. Judy Mikovits thread (here). He also confirms what I have been told about someone who is sick will re-inhale their own expelled virus cells, constantly re-infecting themselves, which increases their viral load and increases the risk of serious complications.

There is another danger to wearing these masks on a daily basis, especially if worn for several hours. When a person is infected with a respiratory virus, they will expel some of the virus with each breath. If they are wearing a mask, especially an N95 mask or other tightly fitting mask, they will be constantly rebreathing the viruses, raising the concentration of the virus in the lungs and the nasal passages. We know that people who have the worst reactions to the coronavirus have the highest concentrations of the virus early on. And this leads to the deadly cytokine storm in a selected number.

It gets even more frightening. Newer evidence suggests that in some cases the virus can enter the brain. In most instances it enters the brain by way of the olfactory nerves (smell nerves), which connect directly with the area of the brain dealing with recent memory and memory consolidation. By wearing a mask, the exhaled viruses will not be able to escape and will concentrate in the nasal passages, enter the olfactory nerves and travel into the brain.

Sounds like a recipe for disaster and exactly the opposite of what we should be doing. And who will be hurt most again?

Unfortunately, no one is telling the frail elderly and those with lung diseases, such as COPD, emphysema or pulmonary fibrosis, of these dangers when wearing a facial mask of any kind—which can cause a severe worsening of lung function. This also includes lung cancer patients and people having had lung surgery, especially with partial resection or even the removal of a whole lung.

One could be forgiven for thinking this is a better plan for culling the herd than for herd immunity. Hmmmmm.....

Knowledge is power. Please think carefully about how and when to wear a mask, and especially for how long. Face masks pose risks for everyone wearing them -- the healthy and the sick -- and provide little if any protection for anyone. </COMMENT 10>

<COMMENT 13> I work in a prison as a mid-level provider. Because of limited resources, I wear a homemade mask just around the facility. But when I see patients (which are not too many at the present, thank goodness!) I put on an N95 mask. I have had to stretch out my use of them for a few days, but I try to make sure I have a good seal but also try to maintain some physical distancing, make exams as quick as possible, as well as have a my windows open (which is not much) just to get good airflow.  I treat every inmate I see like a covid patient, because quite a few are completely asymptomatic.  The surprising thing, is that we have over 900 inmates. It is now Jun 3rd. Maybe 20 had any symptoms whatsoever, mostly mild, and a handful went to the hospital, and one man died who had worsening COPD, and other issues.  The hospitals here started patients on Hydroxychloroquine regimen pretty much immediately, with zinc, vit C, and Azithromycin (or substitute). I just saw one of the guys I sent out who recovered - about to turn 80! w/ many health issues, still having dyspnea on exertion but improving daily.  you can't tell me that this therapeutic regimen does not work, IF given EARLY enough.  I believe that political leaders who forbid the use of this medication regimen should be accountable for any deaths that possibly could have been avoided... but thats my opinion. If I am sick with some virus we don't have much knowledge about, I want you to give my everything you can!  
FWI, for those who probably do not know this,  HCQ was used in treating the FIRST Coronavirus outbreak 17 yrs ago and it was effective. 
Stay healthy, stay safe, use personal distancing when possible & masks when not possible. Use masks at stores, etc, if any risks of being in close contact with others for more long periods of time, and you should be ok. But don't wear a mask when going for a walk outside when the closest person is 2 blocks away, or while driving your car for pete's sake!  Get some FRESH AIR and go outside & enjoy some sunshine on your face. :) </COMMENT 13>

<COMMENT 16> This video came up in my feed and I decided to give it a shot. I was waiting for something brilliant. I'm disappointed. N95 masks should NOT be worn at all times even in hospital settings. The rationale is that one is constantly being exposed to virus particles in the air. Ok, then wear the N95 when you enter the room then take it off.  Healthcare providers who are required to wear them at all times suffer from hypoxia, causing lightheadedness and headaches. They are horribly uncomfortable and after rebreathing their own CO2 and it feels like you can't breathe. We cannot make the cure worse than the disease.  Older people, especially those with lung disease should NOT wear an N95 mask, especially when doing an activity that requires greater oxygen consumption and high concentration like driving. People with HTN have been known to worsen their condition wearing even surgical masks. There's more to this than you are presenting. Keep researching all sides of things. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> I like your dimples . They are tonics for mood. Please wear n95 masks. 😍😊😘 </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> What a bunch of BS, on the one hand they claim that COVID19 spreads in the air all day long from a person who has it, so their body produces the virus indefinitely, and then they say they still don't know much about it, so which is it????? </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Ja...its all about keeping your immune system charged..in addition to what you said re distancing and ppe...the MOST important thing is to take your vit C D E and Zinc Magnesium and a strong multivitamins every morning </COMMENT 19>

Covid19 actually started at the Military World Game in Wuhan in October 2019 brought by the American Contingent.

what were you doing in the streets again?!
Just nonsense upon nonsense.
Total nonsense. </COMMENT 4>

<COMMENT 6> The problem is that this is med tech. There are regulations here for a reason. 
The "vacuum cleaner mask" thing is dangerous because there are studies showing users are exposed to the inhalation of glass like fragments that can go on to cause lung cancer in the long run. Hundreds of thousands of people have probably gone on to do this after it went viral. We won't even know for a decade or two. 

A lot of these things can't hurt. But it's very important to test these things
I'm a founder of a med tech company - caroundyou.com - and though i agree that a lot of these things are arbitrary, it's better we get this right than not in cases where there's potential for harm at the very least. </COMMENT 6>

<COMMENT 1> Old news, stop dramatising the matter of  late responses and work together to find a vaccine for it. Western media stop the hypocrisy. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> delayed for few days... LOL even weeks earlier wouldn't have helped, with the western government attitudes towards the virus that we have seen so far... </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> For such a big country, it takes time to work out the virus. I think that is quite fair. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> What China told WHO and what WHO repeated was that OUTSIDE OF TRANSMISSION BY FAMILY MEMBERS TO EACH OTHER, there was no evidence of wider transmission. That was what was verifiable at the time. When wider human to human transmission was verified, China told WHO and WHO declared a pandemic. When China dealt with the virus, it was new and yet it is being criticised for being cautious.  When the virus reached the US, Trump was only interested in playing it down but you don't describe that as a cover-up. Typical double standards. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Lol, it was so evident from the start that china was Not telling the Truth. China has never been transparent in many instances. 
It will be interesting to see what China's closest allies would say now that the facts are coming out.  
To divert internal and external attention from China's failure (probably intentional) in managing (hiding facts) the Covid19 virus, China is showing aggressive behaviour in south china sea, in Hong Kong, on Taiwan, in the borders of India, against Australia. </COMMENT 5>

<COMMENT 7> 共匪 </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> let science make that decision. governments has to filter a virus out of thousands of possibilities. only supercomputers with power multiple times of  AWS/Azure can process these genome sequencing jobs. error margin is also high. it's not a laptop job. 2003 SARS genome sequencing took 18 months. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> China & Iran first affected. Why? Who is their enemy? </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> AP is a mouth piece of US. Haven’t unable to pin China down of withholding info earlier, they are now focusing on the date genome sequence was published. Facts are: Dec 30 China realised only then there was an unknown virus. All lab reports were just diagnose of virus type, no genome info. Best evidence was the social media messages n attached lab report by Dr. Li Wenliang, the western label “whistle blower”.  China then sent multiple samples out on Dec30/31 to multiple labs around China.  China published the results on Jan 10. 
So AP is bashing China that 10 days was not fast enough.  Don’t they think publish a genome sequence need confirmation from multiple sources, verification and caution? Testing kits, tracing and others activities will follow?  They say China should be 5-9 days faster. They said their have documents, but no details and sources  provided for verification as usual. 
Can they provide a comparison on how soon other new virus genome sequence have been published from 1st known? US only produced its test kit March 2, 50+ days after genome sequence all known and 45 days behind Germany. What makes US think other was not doing a reasonable job? </COMMENT 10>

<COMMENT 16> WHO is lying trying to save it's money for first class tickets, five star presidential suite and limousines. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Withheld or not, the infotmation wasnt responsible for the poor response of the US. WHO confirmed H2H transmission on Jan 21. The border shut down didnt happen the same day or the next or a week after. The fact is that nobody took the Virus serious, not even China. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> I want to marry Katrina Yu 😍😍😍 </COMMENT 18>

<COMMENT 1> What are your questions regarding the coronavirus pandemic? #askDerrick </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Recommend a mask manufacturer, price: 0.14 USD / PCS, and only 7 USD for 50 PCS!! FDA test passed, which registration serial number is 10062936. You could check it on the FDA website, it’s OK for medical or surgical usage. Contact email: stephenyaftersale@foxmail.com or website: www.superyouke.com.

I did some deep investigation and all the information from this supplier was in line with my requirements. This is the first face mask manufacturer that has truly passed all tests and is willing to provide the original certificates since I have bought so many masks from different sellers on Amazon, who were either too expensive or too bad quality.

I ordered 50,000pcs and contacted the local UPS for delivery. It only took a week to my place at STOCKTON, CA and my tracking number is 1Z5586Y20466890012.

The reason I ordered this big amount of face masks is that we do have urgent need for this. I have raised its price a little and made a little money for my spent time and energy. Hope this information can help out. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> So the goverment is ok to hand out furloughs all over the place but dont have enough money to give a face mask and gloves to every man woman and child on the planet.  They seem to know where we all live why not pop a reusable mask and gloves in a jiffy bag and pop it in the post. Wat does it cost   prolly less than the billions that's already went out the door </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> How the heck are we going to get sick ie develop immunity if were trying to avoid etting sick in the first place?? And wh y are we refering to getting the flu as a security threat?????

This might help explain why younger people are less affected, as they are always on their cellphones.....? </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Does somebody know if there are masks that can be reused, and how? I can't afford to buy too many masks, and I still have to go to work.. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Masks are trash. Annoying as heck to wear it for all day. People.who say masks are awesome dont even wear them 6 hours a day. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> These so called experts from W.H.O. and C.D.C.(USA)should be executed !  I lost my mom because of their idiotic advice that all you got to do is wash your hands real good. This is not something new. All these so called experts should know about Bird flu and SARS. How did the Asian countries fight those contagions back then and now Covid-19. PUT YOUR FACE MASKS ON AND WASH YOUR HANDS !  I live in New York City. Over 20,000 dead and counting and they are still debating if wearing face masks helps. I want the names of these experts. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Wearing a mask for a long time..you rebreathe your own air.. and co2. It can make yr levels of co2  go up and you can  become hypoxic..a lack of oxygen. The effects are dizziness, shortness of breath, light headedness, anxiety and stress due to over compensating to breathe, which in turn lowers your immunity.
Building up your natural immunity, through good nutrition, vitamins, exercise, has proved to be useful and effective </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> If you wear a mask in Chicago will that protect you from getting shot and killed? </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Professor with all do respect I disagree. Pore size of the fabric mask can be expressed by Poisseuilee’s law.  Everage is :118-1111 micron. The coronavirus average diameter is 0.125 micron.  Do the math. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> The only things people in countries where mass deaths occur do “actively” is question, argue, discuss, analyze and debate just like this video. Unbelievable. That is how they let their people die. Talk, talk, talk, and not do things obviously needed while thousands of their fellow citizens die. 
Why don’t you just wear masks as doctors do when they treat patients with infectious diseases, as firefighters wear fire-resistant clothing when they enter forest fires, and as you use umbrellas in the rain to keep you dry, without asking? You know without having to argue, analyze and discuss that such acts will give you significant protection if not 100% protection. Save your lives for god’s sake! Your fellow people are dying while you talk nonsense.
If you have the virus, would you infect numerous persons through chain effects, or if you haven't, would you risk contracting the virus from those who have by refusing to wear a mask? Or would you reduce such risks to 6% by wearing it? Would you rather run to amrkets and hoard useless toilet papar without questioning but need questioning, duscussions, debates, arguments and analyses to make an obvious 2-year-old-level choice? Really??????? </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Replacing the fresh oxygen your brain needs with rebreathed carbon dioxide is most beneficial.  Let's make it mandatory!  

Whoever wants to wear a mask is free to do so - but then I shouldn't have to wear one, right?  If I don't have a mask, what are you worried about?  Don't you trust yours?  Supposedly I can't get a germ from you, nor you from me, right?  Same with a vaccine.  If I haven't taken Bill Gates' population-control vaccine, what are you worried about?  Doesn't your shot protect you from me, and me from you?  If I am still fined, or otherwise forced, to wear a mask or get a vaccine, when everyone else has a mask or been vaccinated, then we will know for sure that this is not about covid at all, but control and compliance.  

Masks also hamper and discourage interpersonal communication, and erase individuality.  Having everybody look the same is a hallmark of totalitarian societies.  And if you call the covid hotline on me for not social distancing, you will accept totalitarianism hook, line, and sinker; hope you enjoy the permanent lockdown and empty store shelves. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 5> Roughly translated - we know transport will be packed soon wear a mask so it looks like we are at least doing something. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Why is it beneficial, useful or lawful to demand the use of face masks on public transport?

When the transmission period of airborne infectious diseases "ENDED" in May?

This makes no sense and is just propaganda aimed at control and not the reduction in spread of an airborne infectious disease! </COMMENT 6>

<COMMENT 14> Electric vehicles are not green </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> How about justifying your position before forcing us to relinquish our rights. So far we see less than 10% of overall deaths are covid this year. Total bull shit. When those rioting Americans all drop dead I will believe that this was all benign. </COMMENT 15>

Its time people stood up and realised the tyranny of governemts and the global one world government agenda! ALL COUNTRIES ARE PRACTICALLY DOING THE SAME THING!! That should tell you there is an one world government calling the shots! Mandated vaccines NO! Mandated masks NO! Mandated track and tracing NO! People need to wake up to the global agenda! This is going to get far worse! The elites all must be sat laughing at us sheeple for following ORDERS! Governments are advisors to the people, we are meant to be a democary! They should never force anything onto the people who VOTE them in! I pay my taxes to this apauling government and I shoudl be allowed to do freely what I wish as long as I do no harm to others! If i chose not to vaccinate, thats my choice! If i choose not to wear a mask, thats my choice! I want my F'ing taxes back if im unable to use them!!! Absolute FRAUD! </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 2> Ich hab Husten und Schnupfen und eine volle nase aber das ist wegen Pollenallergie 😡 </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Wenn mal für eine Zeit Wasser am Herz hatte, aber jetzt alles wieder okay ist, gehört man dann trotzdem noch zu den Risikogruppen oder nicht? Oder gilt das nur für frühere Lungenerkrankungen? </COMMENT 3>

Ich bin 13 und habe Asthma, aber noch nicht so das man irgendetwas merkt und in einem sehr frühen Stadium. Könnte ich gefährdet sein? </COMMENT 11>

<COMMENT 1> Old news, stop dramatising the matter of  late responses and work together to find a vaccine for it. Western media stop the hypocrisy. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> delayed for few days... LOL even weeks earlier wouldn't have helped, with the western government attitudes towards the virus that we have seen so far... </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> For such a big country, it takes time to work out the virus. I think that is quite fair. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> What China told WHO and what WHO repeated was that OUTSIDE OF TRANSMISSION BY FAMILY MEMBERS TO EACH OTHER, there was no evidence of wider transmission. That was what was verifiable at the time. When wider human to human transmission was verified, China told WHO and WHO declared a pandemic. When China dealt with the virus, it was new and yet it is being criticised for being cautious.  When the virus reached the US, Trump was only interested in playing it down but you don't describe that as a cover-up. Typical double standards. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Lol, it was so evident from the start that china was Not telling the Truth. China has never been transparent in many instances. 
It will be interesting to see what China's closest allies would say now that the facts are coming out.  
To divert internal and external attention from China's failure (probably intentional) in managing (hiding facts) the Covid19 virus, China is showing aggressive behaviour in south china sea, in Hong Kong, on Taiwan, in the borders of India, against Australia. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> 共匪 </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> 共匪 </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> let science make that decision. governments has to filter a virus out of thousands of possibilities. only supercomputers with power multiple times of  AWS/Azure can process these genome sequencing jobs. error margin is also high. it's not a laptop job. 2003 SARS genome sequencing took 18 months. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> China & Iran first affected. Why? Who is their enemy? </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> AP is a mouth piece of US. Haven’t unable to pin China down of withholding info earlier, they are now focusing on the date genome sequence was published. Facts are: Dec 30 China realised only then there was an unknown virus. All lab reports were just diagnose of virus type, no genome info. Best evidence was the social media messages n attached lab report by Dr. Li Wenliang, the western label “whistle blower”.  China then sent multiple samples out on Dec30/31 to multiple labs around China.  China published the results on Jan 10. 
So AP is bashing China that 10 days was not fast enough.  Don’t they think publish a genome sequence need confirmation from multiple sources, verification and caution? Testing kits, tracing and others activities will follow?  They say China should be 5-9 days faster. They said their have documents, but no details and sources  provided for verification as usual. 
Can they provide a comparison on how soon other new virus genome sequence have been published from 1st known? US only produced its test kit March 2, 50+ days after genome sequence all known and 45 days behind Germany. What makes US think other was not doing a reasonable job? </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> World needs to isolate itself from china </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Kill CCP thugs and hang Tedros </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Why China denies every thing ? Whats wrong with them </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> China is just..... </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> China lied, people died </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> WHO is lying trying to save it's money for first class tickets, five star presidential suite and limousines. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Withheld or not, the infotmation wasnt responsible for the poor response of the US. WHO confirmed H2H transmission on Jan 21. The border shut down didnt happen the same day or the next or a week after. The fact is that nobody took the Virus serious, not even China. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> I want to marry Katrina Yu 😍😍😍 </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> 😂 every single piece of news of that the CCP doesn’t like, or that makes China lose face, they then simply say “that news is incorrect.” Just shocking behavior for a global leader like China. </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 1> well I have said this for the past 5 years about how useless our medical system is right across Canada. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> this is all such BS ! </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> You said it, Canada is a backwards country. The worst part is we have a delusional population that thinks otherwise. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> What happened at 4:20? </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Pharma mafia has complete control </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Trudeau said 8.8 billions dept to china. When state is said instead province. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> He said it right. The health departments were completely incompetent starting at the top at Limb. With the costs paid for healthcare the benefits returned are meager. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Well, it’s not all bad news. Mr Trudeau and has done a bang up job criminalizing law abiding gun owners while doing as close to nothing as possible in dealing with gang violence, opioid overdose deaths and missing First Nation women but you can’t find fault with their genius in solving problems that don’t exist. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Trudeau is obviously dyslexic and his burps and hick ups and audio glitches definitely inserted to cover up his learning challenge. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> WHERE IS JA RULE AT A TIME LIKE THIS </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Hmmm fax as long as people's health info stays private </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> give me a break, this disease kills .2% of infected </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> 30 BILLION deficit run by Trudeau EACH YEAR, working on "infrastructure", and we're still using FAX machines to communicate Federal medical data. Thanks Liberal voters! </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> I been public health nurse for years.
PH and population is not funded the way acute is  funded 
We have outbreaks of syphilis all over the country 

This is a failing empire </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Total  BS ! </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> The CDC is now confirming pretty much everything we tinfoil hatters have been saying since this insanity started:

- COVID-19 tests may be wrong half the time.

- If you don't live in a nursing home, your chances of dying of this flu strain are practically NIL. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> I'm not surprised </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Professor guy looks like DR. STRANGELOVE.  SERIOUSLY. HAHA.  "Yes mr. President...we will need more HOZERZ....FOR BREEEEEEEEDING, for fax purposes.....unfortunately. " </COMMENT 18>

<COMMENT 1> Hi, Mr Ford I need a full time job. Are you hiring.???? </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Take care of our seniors and let the rest of us work. I'm so tired of hearing what you've done in the past OMG can you not see what is happening to our country. Trudeau has shut down parliament to avoid accountability and you Doug Ford repeat same old same old continually, tell us something we don't know. Trudeau and his gang of goons think protests  are just fine in fact they allow these paid activists to riot and loot, we have not been different in Canada look at the blockades and what happened in Vancouver and what is happening in Montreal right now, get with it Doug it's happening, </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Resign Ford. You have no idea what you and you're team are doing! - Grossly incompetent </COMMENT 3>

<COMMENT 5> I learned Canada is such a weak country that can’t deal with the virus. The only solution they have is to shut down the small businesses when other stupid people are having their picnic outside like there is no virus. It seems like you guys don’t give a damn or understand the people who can’t work right now. Just look at the country that successfully contained a virus without even a lockdown and follow them since you guys can’t do shit by yourselves. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> You’re standing behind us but our businesses are closing. Botox is cosmetic and that’s allowed before hair salons?!?!  There is going to be a second wave anyway. Are we going to stand up and fight or stay hiding?!?!🤬. Open us uppppp now Ford!!!! </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> I am truly amazed by his leadership during this crisis!!! I am extremely to the left of center. However, I will vote for Ford for PM in a heart beat! </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> I agree with you, all our merchandise should be MADE in CANADA! </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Doug, you are either an ignorant IDIOT or you are CORRUPT, end of! </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Doug, you are a complete FRAUD, In my opinion! </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> “There are three types of lies -- lies, damn lies, and statistics.” </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> For the average person, wearing a mask and using other PPE is by far the most effective way. How to test your mask at home？ https://youtu.be/_BBQRlY-lhE </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> stop saying the future is uncertain and do something about it and let us out you idiots </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Yes, we must unite.not like USA something  may bad happen. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Blah blah blah blah.
I can't with this anymore. Such bullshit. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Doug Ford, you are ignoring all the scientific information confirming the lockdown needs to end now! </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Mr Ford bless your heart for really thinking and believing that there isn’t a severe level of racism in this country....you represent the majority of Canadians who think this way while many minorities suffer. Please speak to your black community before being so proud of your province or even your country. </COMMENT 17>

<COMMENT 19> When are you going to stop this covid-19 stuff I think you are just full of it just opened things up like normally just making people scared that's not going to help you or anybody </COMMENT 19>

<DESCRIPTION> Water is life. But there's evidence coronavirus could survive in it for days. What role does water play in the fight against the pandemic? It's not just drinking water ... </DESCRIPTION>
<TAGS> ['waste water tracing', 'waste water', 'sewage water', 'corona water', 'coronavirus water', 'coronavirus sewage', 'waste water tracking', 'coronavirus', 'covid19', 'covid 19', 'coronavirus test', 'corona test', 'coronavirus testing', 'covid 19 test', 'wastewater', 'covid 19 news'] </TAGS>
<COMMENT 1> If you have a question about the coronavirus crisis or COVID-19, ask our science correspondent Derrick Williams here! #askDerrick </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Are we going to create a chorine  resistant virus that's transmitted in our drinking water because we have half of our people not caring about the virus </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> 7:25 Of course you won't find COVID-19 in water, it is a disease caused by the virus SARS-Cov-2... it can only happen inside people and in their respiratory tracts at that... why are they even checking for COVID-19 it's the virus we we need to check for not the disease! </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Please acknowledge the importance of looking behind the curtain of our food system. Do you know where your Pork comes from? 95% of the world’s leading Pork meat industries use a method of production called Factory Farming. These major industries demand for more meat and more profit has led to significant abuse of the environment, animals, and in the end, our bodies. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> The sewage plant is a long way from the toilet bowl,  why would you even think there would be live viral particles at that distance, who's thinking. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> RB Leipzig </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Horrible reporting she continued to ask same questions </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> why is Africa always poor despite billions of donations by other countries in the world? </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Weird... Viruses are not form of life, so they can't be live or dead, rather they can be there or not... </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Sea water is more safe than the swimming pool. Because of the salt and because the sea water constantly cleaning up it shores. Hahahaha </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Dam those bat need to maintain social distancing. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> What justifies a virus? Is it dead or alive? If the virus is whole and dead, yet is found in treatment water at a waste facility, then why is it no more transmissible than a "live" virus?

Heres my opinion:
    These days will be remembered as the easy days...year 1 of the virus. I think things globally will get worse everywhere. We are living out the times of sorrows. We are living out the bible. Only people ignorant of it, or too blinded by worldly and materialistic desires are dumb to the prophetic meaning of it all. Like god said, the meek shall inherit the earth, and those who think they are intelligent will be made to look like fools. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Her neck is so long </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Thankyou for sharing this video. It is most enlightening. Cheers from Michael. Australia. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Too much common sense and respectful informed reporting and questioning here. I'm off back to the BBC News to feed my fear panic and neurosis </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Bottom line it's crystal clear, it's all about global depopulation. But not last total global population control with RFID chip. Now there is tons of evidence that do not lines up to any of this video or videos like this. Many scientists, doctors PhD, MB etc. come up and says different than W. H. O. Conspiracy and facts should always work together. History has shown that is always lies, cover up, interests, power, influence, dark plans, when big subjects are number one. Even in war times, where people should be together. Above everything else is faith in God, this is the source where evil is fighting. The more you believe in God, Bible, the better you are protected. Let's say a continent truly do God's work, than you should see a big difference in good. And all humans being bless. Right now the path is destructions in time. That's way  it's down to individual to at least save yourself from evil doing. This is it. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Amazing WD news I wish should have found this sooner. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> This supposed virus was downgraded to Flu level on March19th 2020 on the UK governments website...why?, and why the fear mongering since then? This is political will bringing in the "new normal", not the "virus" Please wake up because we are in the beginnings of total social change...by design and it does not include personal freedoms. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> if you like book recommendations, fivebooks.com does amazing weekly book recommendations, virtually nobody's heard of them and they have several on epidemics (the website has the archive interviews with specialists on the topic). Lithub daily is good too, better than the weekly. Bookriot is a bit YA, and bookbub is just bargains </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 1> If bank is willing to take a loss, more than half of the jobs will not be lost. 
Change my mind </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> All the resources we had 3 months ago are still here. The workers are here. The consumers are here. All the needs we had remain. Why can't the economy restart ?  Economy is a b.s. made up thing. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Please don't show the image of Hong Kong when talk about China. It's different. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Ah, the Guessperts at it again. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> I'm still not taking a sketchy vaccine, no matter what you and Bill Gates say 😤 </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Little by little that mad max dystopia of the future is being created. They think it's all a movie. Humans mean nothing. Collectively we're larger and can stop this from happening. This is the time to unite. Dont buy into their narrative and dont allow these masters dictate how we live. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> I don't know but I feel the numbers are going crazy in Arizona..... Currently 22,753 cases but deaths are going really up .... 996 deaths but what concerns me is we have over 146 nursing homes in Phoenix and Scottsdale. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> The only way to get rid of debt quickly is to print money. Just like in the 1930s, it's plausible that central banks will be deleveraging through too risky quantitative easing. Devaluates debt, but also causes massive inflation. Scary times, not just from a health perspective, but both socially and economically as well. This video didn't really help me find solace either. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Do you have Bitcoins and you want to multiply your BTC through Bitcoin Mining without sending your coins to anyone? Are you ready for self-custody of your investment funds? Do you like the sound of regular, consistent results and profitable performance? Tired of Forex and Crypto failures STOP everything!!! Our Mining Service is for you, with us, you can can earn daily BTC profits credited directly to your Bitcoin wallet by just connecting your wallet to our Mining Pool. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Getting rid of small business makes way for big business monopolies </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Its the media thats shaping the economy. Mass panic produced by countless times repeated immages. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Why is nobody seriously talking about legally stopping or delaying the rights of rentists or speculators in general to charge what they own as a most probable solution both in the short and long terms?!? In other words, why is the pressure not being put on top of the pyramid? </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Lies! China is going through another wave of covid-19 in other areas.

Of course China is operating at near 90 percent its communist tactics. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Is it fair to say that the 90% economy represents a near-term 'best case scenario'? I mean, doesn't China's 90% economy example that other countries might hope to duplicate hinge upon that country's ability to manage the spread of disease effectively? I think the US, UK, and several other countries (Russia, Brazil, etc.) might not have much of a chance of achieving a 90% level given how poorly we have managed the outbreak thus far. The possibility of multiple lockdown cycles in response to regional or local outbreaks only seems likely to slow economic recovery.

If ever there were a time for unifying leadership, following the advice of experts, and kindness to those in need, it is now. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Well unfortunately, dying from infectious disease (eventually) IS the actual normal, we just had an anomaly lasting about 100 years where it was not. This is the OLD NORMAL, or just the normal for about half the world. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Not for the dino zoo accordingto the economist </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> China doesn't have the debt the rest of the world does </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> The Economist was once one of the most respected journals on the planet.  Now it's dominated by globalists who present biased viewpoints.  One must question the legitimacy of all articles. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> What is not being considered is the effects of the rioting, looting, closing or shutting of many stores and business in the wake of the George Floyd killing. In Minneapolis/Saint Paul, something close to 90% of all retail business have been closed and boarded up. Businesses already in trouble from the pandemic, will go under following the riots, even if not not even looted. </COMMENT 19>

<DESCRIPTION> Introducing the “Facts From the Frontlines” episode of #TheTonyRobbinsPodcast – where Tony uncovers the truth about coronavirus with a 7-person panel of ... </DESCRIPTION>
<TAGS> ['tony robbins', 'motivation', 'inspiration'] </TAGS>
<COMMENT 1> The all time the fear and anger were triggers to something big coming....vax....you mustbsee past the covid19, riots, and soon second wave of fakedemic, famine (food shortage is coming) etc  to what they are pushing for. NWO. Brace for your rights totally gone, controlled imposed on you and way of life disrupted. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> How do you stop an election you know you have no chance of winning? </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> At this point it’s advisable to ignore the stories coming out of The UN that have been pumped into the mainstream news that politicians are using to misinform the citizenry.  

It’s now four months later and the public is still ignorant because they are listening to daily numbers of infections and deaths opposed to shutting down the social media and doing your own research and using your own common sense.  

The masks??? They are so below standard that people have developed a false sense of security.  Hand all over them unwashed.  Persecuting others that don’t wear them because in Canada there are still no masks.  There is a rage coming from these frightened people.  It’s surprising that these people have no common sense and are listening to people who don’t have a clue in reality.

I have been listening to these doctors that spoke here from the start.  Thank God for them and all the front line workers.  It breaks my heart that many citizens don’t appreciate their sacrifice.  
We love your heart ❤️ Tony.  People should limit their social media during this Covid19.  Stop panicking and be kind to each other.  I continue to create, enjoy my life and stay safe.  I’m so blessed that I knew Hulda Clark an amazing biologist whose books I studied years ago. She was a brilliant biologist specializing in parasitology, virology and what causes disease.  She created a meter that kills viruses and parasites and infections with electronic frequencies.  Very effective.  I had incurable bowel and digestive diseases and used her devise combined with herbs and have not been to a doctor since.  I stopped the use of 5000 mg of anti-inflammatory harmful prescriptions against doctors advise and recovered.

If I get a flu or cold I use the meters frequencies to kill the virus or infection in max two days. Complete recovery, therefore I don’t fear this.  Parasites, the only place that the meter can not destroy parasites is in the bowel but there are herbs combined with the frequencies destroy them. Zapped.  I built the meter 20 years ago based on the directions in Hulda’s two books. The information is in her book is brilliant.  

While she lived Many in the medical world rejected Hulda Clark and it’s unfortunate for all of us.  She was an amazing scientist.  We don’t have cures today because of closed mindsets past and present.  People are constantly listening to the wrong people.

Citizens worldwide Seek God, Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit because they are all knowing.  They saved my life and gave me wisdom during my medical and life’s trials.  Jesus is where our hope lies. John 3:16 ❤️ 💕 </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> One thing your not hearing....the CDC has revised the death rate for covid19 to between 0.2 and 0.3 percent....a far cry from the 3.5 percent death rate used to scare governments into lockdown.... </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Everything you have ever been told... Learned in school.. University.. College.. Programmed by your media... Film..Religion.... Your government.... Its all a LIE!!! Humanity is waking up.. Some quickly... Some slowly... And very soon those instigating the lies will pay the price... Have faith in humanity and yourselves. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Another reason to get off this ship of Fools! It's a smokescreen....Get off the ship of fools! ie. the Maritime Laws...we are the people of the land via constitution 1900 stop being slaves its unlawful! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHh0V7UjVXI </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Get the economy going, don't wear a mask, obey your corporate masters, be good sheeple. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> So let's get this straight: Tony et al are advocating eugenics, euthanasia and gerontocide. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Makes sense great talk.... not 200000 years though </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Thank you. Finally we could hear  other opinions. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Since when have we quarantine the healthy? </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> I fear with the Democrats have planned next. They tried to blow up a nuclear facility and that was caught by the Trump Administration. Wonder what else they've caught. But if you think the Democrats done you're wrong. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> The BBC will keep its charter to keep its licence fee because it has done such a good job of raking up the fear  ,and lets see if the newspaper editors get knighthoods because they have done the same ,people should be getting angry about all of this , l heard and l do not know if it is true but the IMF and the world bank bribed countries to play ball and create a crisis over a virus that does not exist ,DR MI Adil a doctor in the UK and he has now  lost his job for a opinion. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> I am not highly educated. But I never believed in Plandemic from the beginning. Thanks to Plandemic I went deep down into research about Big Pharmas, Clintons and Obamas, Fauci, WHO and many other related topics. I managed learn a lot from my research. I am not surprised but it is sad that to see all these educated fools deceived by Mainstream Media. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> poor generation of kids now we have to put so much fear in to them, what a world we live in? It is hard enough to say NO all the time,what will they inherit? Overwhelming despair and contempt anger and rage,loneliness,confusion, where tgey live their lives on the internet </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> What confuses me is and I am completely with the thinking this is a scam , is how did 90% of all governments world wide take the same action.  
The WHO are only advisory. Surely not all governments are blind or that gullible. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Deaths around the same as a flu season - yes, a flu season WITHOUT lockdown and social distancing. We see the same number of deaths from covid as a flu season despite all of the lockdown and social distancing - they would have been significantly higher, astronomically even, if as these fools keep suggesting we didn’t bother with any of that. They can’t be that smart if they are missing that painfully obvious fact - either that or they have an agenda 🤔 they go on about incidence death rate then skew the numbers - true incidence death rate is way higher than they try to say here. 1 in 1000 is 0.1% (taken from the flu season) and assumes everybody was infected with the same number of deaths we currently have, but you cannot do that as not everybody has been infected thanks to lockdown and social distancing. You take the number of competed cases and number of deaths and from there you get 11%. Even conservative figures give 3-4%. Wake up people, following these videos like sheep without thinking for yourselves is JUST AS BAD as following government advice without thinking for yourselves.

The whole second section is irrelevant because excess deaths are excess deaths. Attribution of the cause of death doesn’t matter as that will be statistically insignificant compared to excess deaths from covid, unless someone can explain why else there would be such a hugely significant uptick in excess deaths.

Opening up the economy - this doctor doesn’t seem to understand the concept that a virus spreads. Yes, younger people are (often) at less risk themselves, but if everything was fully open the virus would inevitably spread to older and more vulnerable people. That, to me, is the very definition of increased risk. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Rise up </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Look I know what people will say that I am through my searching for the truth their is a Dr who is widely known for his honestly and his level in the medical field and med community he has showen with proof that the four proteins that make up vivid the only four proteins of this vicious are hiv proteins that have been humanly modified to go from h I v to aids in a short time that is why they can't get a grip on it that is why young people are not effected to the level that older people are most older people have a weak immune says compared too the young most older people fight things like medication immunize system from being on meds and other common health related issues that come with age that most young don't have to deal with now but the young of today will find as they fight to have lockdown lifted and call it economic depression are gonna find out in the next few years that they have h I v and it will turn into aids in a short time and our children and young people of our tommrow  will be in trouble and it will be too late for them to be saved killing millions the Dr name is reside butter his videos are being deleted by Google and u tube and face book as fast as they are being put up their is another Dr that deals only with viruses that only deal with proteins from h I v and aids and he blown away by his findings his name is Galit  Alter </COMMENT 19>

<DESCRIPTION> Water is life. But there's evidence coronavirus could survive in it for days. What role does water play in the fight against the pandemic? It's not just drinking water ... </DESCRIPTION>
<TAGS> ['waste water tracing', 'waste water', 'sewage water', 'corona water', 'coronavirus water', 'coronavirus sewage', 'waste water tracking', 'coronavirus', 'covid19', 'covid 19', 'coronavirus test', 'corona test', 'coronavirus testing', 'covid 19 test', 'wastewater', 'covid 19 news'] </TAGS>
<COMMENT 1> If you have a question about the coronavirus crisis or COVID-19, ask our science correspondent Derrick Williams here! #askDerrick </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Are we going to create a chorine  resistant virus that's transmitted in our drinking water because we have half of our people not caring about the virus </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> 7:25 Of course you won't find COVID-19 in water, it is a disease caused by the virus SARS-Cov-2... it can only happen inside people and in their respiratory tracts at that... why are they even checking for COVID-19 it's the virus we we need to check for not the disease! </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Please acknowledge the importance of looking behind the curtain of our food system. Do you know where your Pork comes from? 95% of the world’s leading Pork meat industries use a method of production called Factory Farming. These major industries demand for more meat and more profit has led to significant abuse of the environment, animals, and in the end, our bodies. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> The sewage plant is a long way from the toilet bowl,  why would you even think there would be live viral particles at that distance, who's thinking. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> RB Leipzig </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Horrible reporting she continued to ask same questions </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> why is Africa always poor despite billions of donations by other countries in the world? </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Weird... Viruses are not form of life, so they can't be live or dead, rather they can be there or not... </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Sea water is more safe than the swimming pool. Because of the salt and because the sea water constantly cleaning up it shores. Hahahaha </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Dam those bat need to maintain social distancing. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> What justifies a virus? Is it dead or alive? If the virus is whole and dead, yet is found in treatment water at a waste facility, then why is it no more transmissible than a "live" virus?

Heres my opinion:
    These days will be remembered as the easy days...year 1 of the virus. I think things globally will get worse everywhere. We are living out the times of sorrows. We are living out the bible. Only people ignorant of it, or too blinded by worldly and materialistic desires are dumb to the prophetic meaning of it all. Like god said, the meek shall inherit the earth, and those who think they are intelligent will be made to look like fools. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Her neck is so long </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Thankyou for sharing this video. It is most enlightening. Cheers from Michael. Australia. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Too much common sense and respectful informed reporting and questioning here. I'm off back to the BBC News to feed my fear panic and neurosis </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Bottom line it's crystal clear, it's all about global depopulation. But not last total global population control with RFID chip. Now there is tons of evidence that do not lines up to any of this video or videos like this. Many scientists, doctors PhD, MB etc. come up and says different than W. H. O. Conspiracy and facts should always work together. History has shown that is always lies, cover up, interests, power, influence, dark plans, when big subjects are number one. Even in war times, where people should be together. Above everything else is faith in God, this is the source where evil is fighting. The more you believe in God, Bible, the better you are protected. Let's say a continent truly do God's work, than you should see a big difference in good. And all humans being bless. Right now the path is destructions in time. That's way  it's down to individual to at least save yourself from evil doing. This is it. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Amazing WD news I wish should have found this sooner. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> This supposed virus was downgraded to Flu level on March19th 2020 on the UK governments website...why?, and why the fear mongering since then? This is political will bringing in the "new normal", not the "virus" Please wake up because we are in the beginnings of total social change...by design and it does not include personal freedoms. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> if you like book recommendations, fivebooks.com does amazing weekly book recommendations, virtually nobody's heard of them and they have several on epidemics (the website has the archive interviews with specialists on the topic). Lithub daily is good too, better than the weekly. Bookriot is a bit YA, and bookbub is just bargains </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 11> Películas con temas similares se han hecho realidad hoy en día y encima estaban ya avisados. Precisamente porque muchos políticos no han reaccionado a tiempo y correctamente, son responsables y deben ser castigados. Que descansen en paz y todas las victimas. 😰😰😰😰😰 </COMMENT 11>

<COMMENT 15> Qué miedo nos metieron al principio con estos vídeos alarmistas de InterNOM.

Pero que nadie crea ingenuamente que InteNOM y los demás medios llamados de comunicaNOM han parado de aterrorizar y que nos van a dejar descansar por un tiempo; además de este tema, que va a seguir dando muchas horas y semanas "inforNOMativas", ya se buscarán otros temas para mantenernos confundidos, entretenidos y atemorizados. Ya se ve claramente que están volviendo a los temas clásicos, con fuerzas renovadas y con nuevas "campañas" globales.

Y al final, el "chip" salvador o su equivalente. El único misterio que queda es...¿por dónde nos lo pensarán meter? Yo ya me hago una idea. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Quizás "el virus" lo cambie todo...porque esté en la agenda. Pero eso de que "arrasó con todo"...¿de dónde se sacan eso?

Ya está pasando la ráfaga y la alarma o ya casi se ha pasado en la práctica, y para gran tristeza general del resto del mundo, EUROPA ha resistido, y muy bien; y para particular escarnio, rabia y desaliento de toda Hispanoamérica, que ya celebraban pública y masivamente la aniquilación y final de todos los españoles, ESPAÑA, otra vez, sale del hoyo donde la metían, enterraban y daban por muerta. No ha sido el fin, y España sale viva y hasta con nota. En fin, unos quisieran proponer, pero Dios dispone. El mundo es así.

Como muestra de normalización, ya están de nuevo retomandose en los medios las noticias-propaganda que se quedaron en un paréntesis. Ya están aquí de nuevo los de siempre, con lo de siempre. Pero, en fin, no todo iba a ser bueno... </COMMENT 16>

<COMMENT 1> Phew. That might have been the fastest we ever made a video. Literally working day and night. A huge challenge in talking about Corona was that the science is ongoing. So we put in extra special care to have good sources for this video and will update them in the coming weeks and months. Check them out here: https://sites.google.com/view/sourcescorona 


We could not have made this video without experts who took time in one of the busiest periods of their own careers. A huge thanks especially to Dr James Gurney and Dr Max Roser of Our World in Data for helping us make sure the video was as accurate as it could be in a situation that is changing daily.


Also a big shoutout to https://ourworldindata.org/ – the online publication for research and data on the world’s largest problems – and how to make progress solving them. Check out their site. It also includes a constantly updated page on the Corona Pandemic. Working together with them over the years has been a delight.

<COMMENT 1> Je viens d'apprendre, depuis mars 2011 en Syrie, on s'approche doucement des 400.000 morts mais pas du Covid19. Qu'est-ce qui a été prévu pour tester et traiter la population syrienne ou la population des pays en guerre ? Jusqu'ici les gens sont testés puis traités  à la kalachnikov,  je trouve le procédé  un peu excessif. </COMMENT 1>

<DESCRIPTION> On today's episode of Global National, new evidence suggests France's first COVID-19 case was earlier than previously though. Redmond Shannon explains ... </DESCRIPTION>

<COMMENT 1> Well, as compared to "injecting clorax into human body" as indoctrinated to Trump-arded Americans, "bleaching hands with clorax" on the part of Canadians is not nearly as pathetic. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Such an awesome video! </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> saw a lot of Americans leaving comments in Quora about what happened to them in last October to December. Probably a lot of Covid-19 patients in USA were diagnosed as flu last year. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> it means China was able to pick up suspicious diseases in their territory, but France is unable to do so. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Well of course it spread sooner. That was the plan. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Circulating long enough to kill a bunch of people before we even knew what was coming </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Covid 19 evolved around copper smelters in Hubei. It is a disease of copper deficiency first transfecting humans from copper contaminated bats who prefer copper diseased insects as they are easier prey with the bacteria Leptospira. This bacteria occurs in 50% of bats in Hubei and causes a disease not dissimilar to Covid.  Paradoxically copper toxicity in humans displays as a copper deficiency due to the different way copper is bound in the body. Copper supply macrophages which kill pneumonia bacteria and if there is a shortage of copper the signal to less specific parts of the immune system initiating a 'cytokein storm' as those other elements are not effective at killing those particular bacteria. Added to this SOD an anti-inflammatory copper enzyme is also denuded so can't stop the cycle of inflammation caused by the storm. BAM DEAD - copper deficient people increases with age BMI sex men have less copper blood serum. BAME lower vit D lower copper uptake. QED. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Best way to lower the coved-19 number is not to test like BC does, the number will not go up if you don’t test them! </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Considering the low death toll numbers in China's neighbouring countries and the huge death toll in Europe, one has to wonder if Covid-19 really did originate in China. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> the moral of story immigration, tourism and our travaler who decide to keep flying around increase the number we have now!
quite normal NB there is such a low case no big air travel not as much immigration or traveler, lower population! no crossbording with new york and ontario,  chinese ppl when back home from china in that festive time! bcuz chinese new eve. the only ppl to blame is our government for the time they take actions and the CCP that warn these traveler before puting them in quarantine,
not the chinese ppl is to blame just make sure you know the difference, did they voluntary and involuntary bring this back here maybe but its still CPP who keep them in FEAR
I warn ppl about this since 26 of december. this is far from being over... everyone need to wear mask in public all the time for some good time. that actually what i would do to put all the chance on our side to defeat this pandemic. even a slight .% is better than nothing and wash youre hands stay safe.... </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Planed demic. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Yes are groceries more expensive?? </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> There are medical personnel reporting that COVID19 was genetically engineered in America. The reports state that a corona flu virus was spliced with particles of DNA from ebola, HIV and SARS strain. The American government ordered the project shutdown because it was too dangerous. Instead the head doctor moved the project to a biolaboratory in Wuhan, China where things got out of hand.  Then medical and security personnel from China reported that some government people wanted the virus manufactured and put in gas to gas protestors and other dissenters to make them too sick to protest government and corporate corruption. Many citizens were protesting corporate greed and corruption, low wages and corrupt government policies that brown nose to the corrupt wealthy thieves that poison our planet and peoples. The protest are happening in Europe, Hong Kong and China every weekend for. Over a year. Please stop media blackout. Our world needs a course in kindness and fairness. So more it be.

<COMMENT 17> Russia and China LoL finessed everyone GLOBAL!!! Lol America is on its knees unbelievable! </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> China must have paid big for this cover story of their escaped pet. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> China may deserve a long awaited apology from many of you! China was the first country that tested and identified the virus but might not be where it's originated. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> China deserves an apology from USA and also from Morrison. He claimed "everyone with common sense knows it came from China".

Where is your common sense now? Are we still going to follow USA into another Iraq war?

China was the first to discover and sequence and shutdown because they have the most competent government in the world who puts its people above corporate profits.. Even now some governments have not locked down and still don't tell people to wear masks and they can't even enforce social distancing laws(if they even have them).

China's has the best approval rating in the world according to surveys from every countries own citizens reporting on their respective govs responses. Thank god this was discovered by China early and they took decisive action. If it was up to USA or the west, we'd all be in a far worse situation.. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 1> Shove the vaccine up your ****

It doesnt justify locking up 65 million people over 45,000 deaths. This bs covid19 is planned by pir government to take away human rights as they have by creating many legislations to restrict human movements. Stage 1 stage 2 stage 3 all bull ****.. wake up as we are been taken for a ride </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> my mom said vacinss bad I belive her more </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> I would say 2 years as everyone is working on it really hard </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> I wonder if some of these Doctors and other so called health professionals spouting this complete nonsense are being blackmailed. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> This woman is so beautiful. And educated!! </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> It is hard to concentrate on the video because she is so attractive & love her accent too 😍 </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> excellently explained. Still we wish it can be done by today. </COMMENT 7>

<COMMENT 11> too much botox for a doctor, is she a cosmetic surgeon ? </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> "What seems to be the problem?"

"My heart starting pounding"

"When did this start happening?"

"As soon as I saw you" </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Coronavirus here to stay. Everyone else is in denial. Unless a miracle happens. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Isn’t it going faster because they cut some of the regulations? </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Whatever one argues the harsh reality is that medication hasn't progressed like other industries. 6+ months & still nothing concrete has come out against this virus how it affects human body, efficacy of face masks, mode of transmission. Even WHO is more concerned about politics(china bias is evident). So much for scientific advancement in medicine and yet not even a therapeutic drug has come out. Even if a drug/vaccine is 50% efficient then it should be used to immunize population under 40 yrs as something is better than nothing, what more damage could it do as people as still dying w/o being diagnosed, such is the extent of this pandemic which the WHO wa hesitant to declare so for more than 4 months </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> I not sure what people in comments are thinking but mumps vaccine first became available in 1967, fol- lowed by the rubella vaccine in 1969. These three vaccines were combined in 1971 to form the measles- mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine we are now talking in 2020 we have a lot of new tecnology and upon these facts I would say we can get some amazing results by the end of 2020. Don't loss hope, take the best precations you can take; these are not normal circumstances. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> I think humans will adapt to this new virus and eventually create its own immunity </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> This is the most informative video on the Covid 19 vaccine progress, or vaccines in general. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Frankly , I hope it is any other country besides the US that develops a vaccine. I don't want to hear the expected "we are the best" gloating BS anymore especially after our disastrous response to this virus. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> I love the way she says " exploratory" ! </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 9> Demasiado rápido </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Y si se pudieran crear vacunas por medio de componentes similares a los del jabon pero que no afecten al organismo del ser humano, una idea seria encontrar los elementos necesarios (tanto quimicos como instrumentales) y replicar un "antibacterial" no perjudicial al cuerpo humano </COMMENT 10>

<COMMENT 15> En lo personal me aplicaría de cuál quier país, q' la hubieran probado en humanos, exepto la de china, con lo q' ha pasado para nada tendría confianza </COMMENT 15>

2030 Update : </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Vaccines....Mandatory, forced vaccines...Line up...Wait, Don’t be me. I am an M.D. but let me tell you what you do not know about vaccines and what I didn’t know and what 90% of all M.D.'s do not know and what No politician knows... I did not know that Vaccines had not been tested against any placebo (ever). I did not know that animal testing would be skipped for the future COVID vaccines..I did not know the 30+ ingredients used in vaccines. I did not know that there are neurotoxic aluminum and mercury molecules in vaccines. I did not know enough to research vaccines before vaccinating my own children. 
I did not know that my own precocious, active, talking son would be vaccine-injured. 
I did not know that my own baby brother (also an M.D.) would become paralyzed (Guillain-Barre) and then die after his swine flu vaccine in the same hospital (Shands) where he had received his medical training. 
I did not know that my mother(an R.N.) would get 8 vaccines in 1 day to "catch-up" with newly added CDC vaccines to keep her job as Head Nurse in the Largest Hospital in the county and then get such severe, aggressive, progressive brain fog in days and become unable to dial a phone or push an elevator button or remember any of her  5 children in a few weeks and then have this "dementia" progress and then die in diapers
I did not know that vaccines were given a blanket indemnity from liability in 1986 and now total immunity for all COVID vaccines for the future. I did not know that we gave more vaccines than any other country starting on day #1...I did not know that we have the highest rate of SIDS of the top 35 industrialized countries... I did not know that we had more autism than any other country... I did not know that Vaccines could injure an infant's brain. 
I did not know that vaccines can result in autoimmunity and neurological damage. I did not know that herd immunity does not apply to vaccines and is a myth created by the CDC. I did not know that Vaccines have almost no effect after about four years. 
I did not know how emotional the topic would be and how angry people would be at me for just asking questions about Vaccine Safety. I did not know that pediatricians were paid to give vaccines. I did not know that the CDC owned the Patents on so many vaccines. 
I did not know that the NIH stands to make Billions of dollars on a COVID vaccine. 
I did not know how angry at myself I would be for not knowing. I did not know that the CDC committed fraud and destroyed their evidence in their vaccine safety studies when it showed vaccines can cause autistic neurological changes..I did not know that a whistleblower came forward with all the evidence but he was silenced. I did not know that Merck committed fraud in their vaccine research repeatedly. I did not know that aluminum molecules in the vaccine ingredients is connected to brain inflammation and brain inflammation has been proven to be connected to autism. 
I did not know that vaccines contained human cells from aborted fetuses..
I did not know how much mainstream media would censor the independent research that showed these facts...I did not know that 90% of all vaccine research that the CDC and FDA use to "approve" vaccines are done by the scientists hired by vaccine makers..I did not know if we were alone... I did not know how many other millions of parents and families in the world have been affected by vaccine reactions..
I did not know how many would find, join, and share the Facebook help group= Vaccine Support Group on Facebook..I did not know that FB would delete the scientific medical research that had been suppressed, deleted, or censored until it happened to us...  Dr.MAS.. </COMMENT 13>

We see many false negatives (tests where no antibody is detected despite the fact we know it is there) and we also see false positives,” wrote Sir John Bell, the Regius Professor of Medicine at the University of Oxford and a government adviser on life sciences, in a university blog post.
“None of the tests we have validated would meet the criteria for a good test” described by the U.K.’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, Bell added. “This is not a good result for test suppliers or for us.”

<COMMENT 11> Faire appel à l'émotionnel plutôt qu'à la réflexion. (Stratégies de Manipulation) nos gouvernements comprennent bien cette technique.

Faire appel à l'émotionnel est une technique classique pour court-circuiter l'analyse rationnelle, et donc le sens critique des individus. De plus, l'utilisation du registre émotionnel permet d'ouvrir la porte d'accès à l'inconscient pour y implanter des idées, des désirs, des peurs, des pulsions, ou des comportements...  Tiré de l'article ''Armes silencieuse pour guerre tranquille''. N'oublier pas vos masques et de vous laver les mains.  Oui papa! :-) </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Vos petits artistes en règle avec vos directive, c’est une autre façon de donner drapé l’argent pour la propagande du virus,,,, ça serait plus profitable d’investir cette argent dans la santé , la vrai santé, pas des histoires de se mettre un masque et de se laver les mains, à ce propos Arruda coûte très cher  pour chanter au clair de la lune.... </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Arruda ferme ta gueule suppôt du globalisme , la pire chose qui puisse arriver aux québécois, c’est que tu parte pas au plus vite. Arrête de faire chier tout le monde, c’est fucking fini. Il n’y a jamais eu de pandémie...mais pas d’épidémie. Vous êtes des menteurs avec Le Bras dans le tordeur , bientôt les gens sauront, et la vous  y payerez au complet dans le tordeur, et bon débarras.

Adios sales traitres, votre état totalitaire ça achève! </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> ARRÊTER VOTRE CIRQUE , IL N’Y A PLUS  DE VIRUS, PARTOUT SUR LA PLANÈTE, IL Y EN A JUSTE À MONTRÉAL.  TOUT EST FINI ET CETTE GANG EST LA À NOUS LESSIVER LE CERVEAU AVEC DES PUBS SUR LE VIRUS ET QU’ON VA TOUT MOURIR SI ON N’ÉCOUTE PAS C’´EST PITOYABLE .
LEGAULT EST AUSSI FUCKER QUE TRUDEAU A DONNER DE L’ARGENT À DROITE ET A GAUCHE.  IL EST VITE POUR DÉPENSER  POUR LES ARTISTES ,MAIS PAS CAPABLE EN  5 mois d’organiser les chsld...   PORTE UN MASQUE POUR LE RESTANT DE TES JOURS.  
LES GENS EN ONT MARRE DE VOS MESONE ET ARNAQUE DE OMS, ALLER EN ENFER C’EST CE QUE VOU NOUS FAITES ENDURER , </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> une vrai joke </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Legault il a passé de droite au communisme assez vite alors. Arrête le lockdown, fuck les artistes, mets les casseurs en prison </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Les artistes?  Who cares.  Ouvrez les Églises à la place. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Yay un autre spectacle de clown! Du beau "circle jerking" entre les gouvernements et les médias, pendant que la population perd ses droits et ses entreprises. Beau travail les bozos! </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Porter le masque selon OMS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4olt47pr_o
Réveillez- vous! Les masques sont pour les personnes malades et pour les travailleurs de l'hôpital etc. Pourquoi on ne dit pas la vérité à la télé? Quel spectacle on regarde? Malheureusement, plusieurs personnes, grâce aux principales acteurs de politique, ont peur. Fermez la télé et vous allez trouver la logique et la vérité. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> M. Legault, pour faire honneur à vos concitoyens, il ne faut pas juste dénoncer le crime raciste qui a entraîné la mort de Georges Floyd, il faut le condamner. C'est plus audible sur le plan de la communication et plus significatif en terme d'expression politique. D'autre part, à la question du profilage racial et du manque de visibilité des autres communautés, vous avez fait le service minimum. La confirmation du constat du journaliste qui est, finalement, resté sur sa faim. Comme la plupart de ceux qui vous ont écouté. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 1> Surprisingly people couldn't see the magnitude of the FWs' problem .. more than 300,000 FWs are to be reaccomodated.
Btw all the Expo Halls have already been retrofitted n could only accommodate 8,000 FWs not even 5% of the 300,000 FWs.
It was reported 40,000 FWs have been cleared or tested. 
When then can the remaining 260,000 FWs accommodation be resolved n these workers can be tested ? 
Long way to go .. moreover most FWs are now isolated in the dormitories so where to get workers to do the works ? </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Just asking who will be our pm in Sg.. after Mr Lee? </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> One overlooked and brought the entire nation to a stand still for 2 months. Don’t want to see her... </COMMENT 3>

<COMMENT 5> Sorry...but the bullshit detector literally exploded when exposed to this video. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> From Those of LKY era to her, how far singapore have fallen! </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Bruh, they seem to be talking really proudly when they were the one that started COVID-19 outbreak in dorms because they told people not to wear mask </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> U r paid so much to be proactive, preventive and not reactive. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Pls resign </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Non </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Jesus Christ!! </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Everyday also got  few hundred cases of FW infected. How much resources and money spent. Knowing them when the time comes, they will make sure squeeze us to the very last drop to take back what has been given </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> government should all foreign living dorms and rooms ban double dorker bed . </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> GE coming. Govt got to be honest. Its still very risky to have such a large numbers of fws living even in bigger dormitories. Its their attitude that's the problem. Thousands of Kong residents are also living under tighter conditions. Why are there so little infections? </COMMENT 14>

<COMMENT 19> 40k not even halfway there. Too slow. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Objectively, she shouldn't be the only person to shoulder all the blames. She presumably took advice from the C-19 appointed Taskforce that formulates the control measures. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 1> This is the COVID-19 motivation 
https://youtu.be/9Q3fVcDmaaw </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Lord please save us </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Govenor pasta  Alfredo had a where house full of ppe but for an emergency but he never thought this was an emergency and that apologize and people took it like nothing happened </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> If manufacturing stayed in America, the US could have avoided more problems than just the shortage of PPE. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> YEAH! Change in your dream. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> We all  ( each country ) needs to be more self sufficient and re-grow our manufacturing base for essential items.  This pandemic has painfully shown that Cost is not the only price we  all pay as a society if we don’t have this strategic capacity. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Jared Kushner has stolen the National supply and sold it on the open market,  guaranteed.  He said the National supply of PPE was his (the feds) and then, in March
$68million of our PPE was sold overseas. In April trump sold $70 million of our PPE overseas, while our hospitals and medical facilities were begging for these supplies. Why did trump sell our PPE when our Nation was in desperate need? Congress needs to investigate. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Oh please, Cumno gave nursing home patients a death sentence </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Just go & test the foods you buy and pills you get from the doctors, you'll be surprised to find out where the virus is, and what they're planning to do with the human population, its better to live off grid , away from governments. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Is it just me or is this the concept of the tv show utopia.js </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> LIBERAL FAKE NEWS!! </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> The coronavirus turned all aspects of life and work, business and economics upside down.  So I wonder how well a more localized supply chain would've managed such a devastating disruption.  Companies still need to secure materials, manufacture products, and distribute them.  e.g. It took Amazon 1 - 2 months to ship simple but essential items like hand sanitizers, face masks, and alcohol swabs to customers. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> The Virus was made by ..........   Why? Experiment, population control, increase fear, madness, and hysteria, lower immune system, distraction, divide and conquer, and just for fun! We are their slaves, zombies and lab rats! Do not live in fear or let it control you, do not let the news and social media trick you or think for you! This is also a test on us sheep to see how controlled and sleep we are! Another lab made illness gifted to the masses! Keywords: Fear pumping, simulation, scare tactics, mind control, media lies, fake news, fake data, adrenochrome..... </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> I was born in monifuri  hospital in the Bronx! I was like awe my birth home! </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Another serious problem not mentioned in this video is America's almost nonexistent Merchant Marine. Over the past several decades we have become more and more and more dependent upon foreign ships to move our products. At this point there are very few ships left in our Merchant Marine fleet. As a result  of this shrinking fleet most Merchant Marine training facilities are educating most students for jobs like managing pleasure boat marinas, etc. Were we to go to war with one of the nations supplying most of our marine transport we would be in a real mess! </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> PPE stopped shipping PPE after they sent travel lots from China to US and Europe </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Its all in chi-nah!! We need to change that. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Ask your mayor. PpD is all over the world </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> On the other side,  the price for anything  about  medical will be going up soon except more government subsidy </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 11> Remedy for Coronavirus
1. In a large bowl combine
*1 head of garlic, diced, (a head of garlic contains many cloves)
*½ cup water
2. Microwave 2-3 minutes (stir at 45 seconds)
3. Eat the garlic mixture while it is warm. Eat twice a day (once in the morning/noon and once before bedtime). Consume a total of 2 heads of garlic per day.
Within 1-2 days, the symptoms will improve. At that time, you may stop or you may continue taking the garlic till the symptoms are completely gone.
Symptoms of Coronavirus include: Fever, cough, rust colored mucus, shortness of breath, body aches, and fatigue
Note: Garlic is not medicine. It is a food that increases the body’s self-healing power. It is safe to take garlic 24/7, year round. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> As far as Africa not being hit as hard as was first feared. Maybe it's got something to do with the difference in the standard of immune systems. Here in the western world we have to have everything sanitised, food, water, surfaces have to be 99.9% clear of bugs and so on. 
We constantly see appeals so a child doesn't have to drink dirty water. Their immune system is probably Olympic standard, as opposed to mine (UK) is equivalent to a school sports day.
It's had nothing to fight for decades. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> This study isn’t correct. The majority of the British is blood group O. And now look at the worlds statistics and find the UK in it. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Do you have advice for people with blood group A? </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Covid is a HOAX and now its past. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Is the person generally born with these various antigens according to her/his blood type? 

Or is this anti-blood type antigen is developed later in ones's life? </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> I survived covid b blood grp </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Since China is less than 1% NEGATIVE bloodtypes...This study refers to the positives....If the negs were affected, would have wiped out a significant amount of certain families....Did anyone hear about any mention of the Li (royalty) family affected? NO....So, as usual, I ask, "why is there no mention of the negatives vs positives"? </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Black people are dieing because this is part of their eugenics plan. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Asking about the 0 negative factor,what role does this play Sir and Thank you🙏🌻❤️ </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 1> What about the 100k people who died last year from the flu? You are being lied to and manipulated. This is a blame it on trump scheme and every governer who is shutting things down is making things worse by not letting the population immunize. Wake up america! </COMMENT 1>

Disgusting.

All you ever fawned over and cared about was the nurses. Nurses this, nurses that. It took 100,000 people dying for you to stop that. 100,000.

100,000 until you noticed the death toll.

<COMMENT 18> The people who constructed this virus got away with almost genocide. We are doing the same thing over and over with these memoriams knowing what actually happened. Are we scared? They made this shxt. The psychology of humans is easily predicted and they use it against us. Alot of us admit they are scared of the truth and just want to live a happy life and take the blue pill. Screw that. Thats what the people behind the scenes want. Wake up! People posting on social media to grieve and morn. We know what's going on! Its time now to act and revolt against this new order. </COMMENT 18>

<COMMENT 20> What nasty bastards the media is poking and dwelling on their plandemic hoax showing faces of dead who could have died anyway from Corona virus or beer. These people are not representative of the overwhelming majority of dead infected Corona dead. Over 80% were over 65 years and 95% in the elderly vulnerable bracket who were vulnerable not just to Corona but any virus any bacteria anything attacking their compromised immune system. Media has been misrepresenting this virus hoax with reporting numbers out of context to scare people </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 1> El único motivo por el que tienen tantos fallecidos es porque dicen la cifra de muertos reales, ellos cuentan todos los muertos por coronavirus porque no les preocupa lo que otros países piensen de ellos. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Los tres aeropuertos de N.Y. mueven mas personas al mes que  cualquier otro aeropuerto del mundo , segun este reporte del 2016  dice " Con un aumento del 6,3% en el movimiento de pasajeros en los primeros seis meses del año, y un promedio superior a 10 millones de usuarios por mes, los aeropuertos de la zona metropolitana de Nueva York alcanzaron un nuevo récord de 62,4 millones de personas. asi que tanta gente entrando y saliendo  es dificil de controlar . y si hay versiones de corona virus  antes de  febrero  tanto queen italia  reportaron  bronquitis y neumonias extrañas   en noviembre  2019. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Se escapara trumpetas a la maldición de un jefe indio del siglo XIX, en la qué decía " los presidente de EEUU qué sé elijan en un año que pueda ser dividido entr 20, morirán antes de terminar su mandato". </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> No se bañan todos los dias </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Ahora mas que nunca Trump 2020. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Esta mas claro!
China fue la que iso el virus para que las potencias Europeas y de Estados Unidos esten en quiebra </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> En usa a parte no dijeron la noticia de que la primera dama había estado enferma gran error para el país. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Estados unidos tiene mas casos cases murtes por ignorancia del pueblo americano y dejarle a los doctores la redponzavilidad como personas que pueden curar el ataque del virus y el virus no es el problema el virus encuentra su mefio amviente o clima y alimento para sobrevivir por lo tanto el virus no es el problema sino la mala alimentacion abace se arina refinada  carne leche
Y vebidas femasiafo asucaradas y alimentos industrialisados cosa que no se da en los animales que no tienen la tiene del humano o sea no tiene nada que ver con la ijiene sino con la alimentacion ojo, ojo el chango porta el virus pero no se desarrolla en el murcielago tampico se desarrolla porque? Porque Viven al natural al interperie el mono come carne  cruda pllantas verdes sin cosinar el problema esta en la ignorancia del hombre  que no save como alimentarce correvtamente  recomendaviones se un naturista como frijoles  cosidos abas garbanzos por cada Plato de frijol un cuanto de sebolla o 2 o 3 Ajos por alimento crudos los ajos y masticados agua fresca de limon sin asucar y santo remedio para los Corona virus eso es recomendacion del naturismo. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Porque son vergonzosamente incapaces como profesionales </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> quien invento el virus... estudio la debilidad humana.. la salud.... el aire </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> la pandemia real no llego.. esto es un simulacro a nivel mundial </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Otra pandemia más que mandó dios 😉 </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Este informe es muy tendencioso y parcial. Pone la culpa en el gobierno de EEUU, pero nada dice que Trump se basaba en los informes falsos emitidos por China y la OMS. El presidente cambió de opinión de febrero a abril, pero todos en el mundo hicimos lo mismo, y fue por culpa de las mentiras del régimen chino. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> América es un continente no una Nación. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Dejen de citar a Chárchill como si fuese el adalid de no se qué... que nadie es santo en éste mundo, pero no serlo y creerse que se es (y hacerselo creer a los demás, encima, pst); no amerita aplausos. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> La nota no hace referencia a la mala información provista por la OMS. 
EEUU tiene mas de 300 MM de habitantes... en mi país ARGENTINA la cuarentena, NO la pandemia, esta haciendo destrozos... </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Te pagó maduro o qué? </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Cuando se quieren hacer bien las cosas no falta la oposición acostumbrado a lo malo, a lo nefasto y a robarle al mundo lo que le pertenece, se hacen pasar por buenos, ven su imperio de maldad caer, los trapitos rotos se muestran y eso le duele. es como dice la palabra de Dios "El diablo solo vino a robar, matar y destruir y anda como león rugiente buscando a quien devorar". 
Busca a Dios con todo tu corazón, alábalo y el malo te dejará tranquilo. </COMMENT 18>

<COMMENT 1> triage gibt es übrigens tagtäglich in der notfallmedizin. wenn ein notarzt zu einem unfall mit mehreren schwerverletzten kommt....es heisst nur nicht so... </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> eigentlich sollte er sich schämen. aber es lebt sich wohl zu gut als pseudowissenschaftliches feigenblatt der political correctness.... </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Bergamo haben sie Infizierte zu den Alten Risikopatienten in Plegeheimen dazu quartiert haben. Herr Lesch, wenn dann richtig recherchieren. ca. 3000 Tote wurden nicht auf Covid19 getestet sondern pauschal dazu gezählt. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Hol du mal den Wagen, Harry... </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Die Krankenhäuser sind leer! Wo sind die Coronafälle denn alle? Es sterben weit mehr Menschen an Herzinfarkt, Alkohol, Rauchen, Im Straßenverkehr, Selbstmord und an Hunger!
Das war mit meiner Wertschätzung für Sie! </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Der größte Propagandapapst der öffentlich-unrechtlichen. Aber lassen wir ihn reden. WIR BEKOMMEN UNSER LAND ZURÜCK. Soviel ist sicher !!! </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Herr Lesch, kann es sein, dass Ihre Hypothese gerade an der Erfahrung gescheitert ist? Tja, das kommt davon, wenn man fachfremde Leute auf Themen loslässt, von denen sie nichts verstehen. Das ist nicht einfach nur peinlich, das ist gemeingefährlich. Suchen Sie sich einen Job, bei dem Sie keinen Schaden anrichten können, Herr Lesch! Sie sind eine Schande für die Wissenschaft! Ich schreibe das, weil ich der Meinung bin, dass man FakeNews nicht unkommentiert lassen darf! </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Dr.Wodarg hatte recht, das war eine normale Grippewelle, die Maßnahmen sind völlig überzogen, man hat Deutschland mit Anlauf vor die Wand gefahren, und die Übersterblichkeit in den südlichen Regionen und den USA kann man auch erklären, siehe letztes Interview von Dr. Wodarg, also Maßnahmen sofort beenden, bevor noch mehr Schaden angerichtet wird, und ansonsten mein Lieblingszitat von Dieter Nuhr: Wenn man keine Ahnung hat, einfach mal F h ..." </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Guten Tag Herr Lesch,
Die Hochrechnung auf 5 Prozent 
Beatmungspflichtige ist falsch.
Infizierte und an Covid 19 Erkrankte dürfen nämlich nicht gleichgesetzt werden.
Diesen Fehler hat das RKI begangen.
Aber es erkranken nur 10 Prozent der Infizierten. Also müsste die 5 Prozent durch 10 dividiert werden, was 0.5 Prozent ergibt. Und selbst diese 0.5 Prozent sind noch zu hoch, denn nicht alle Erkrankte auf Intensivstationen bekommen eine Beatmung.
Das Gesundheitssystem war somit niemals auch nur annähernd gefährdet </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Harry, Du träumst doch nicht etwa immer noch von der Mondlandung  ?!? </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Wie kann man sich für Geld so verkaufen. Der Mann ist kein Mann der Wissenschaft sonder der Indoktrinierung. Tschüss Kanal </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Au weiha, da hat sich der Herr Lesch wirklich total disqualifiziert :-( </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Wenn man nichts macht und hinterher kommt raus, man hätte was machen müssen, ist man der dumme.
Wenn man was macht und hinterher kommt raus, man hätte nichts machen müssen, ist man der dumme.
Hinterher zu sagen, es hätte anders laufen müssen, ist einfach. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Falsche Mathematik </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> er weiß ganz genau welch wissenschaftl.bullshit er da verbreitet und tut es trotzdem.....viel spaß morgens mit dem spiegelbild,muß ja unerträglich sein </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Tja Herr Lesch, wie wär´s  denn mal mit einer Richtigstellung im Nachhinein. Ihre Prognosen hatten sich schon nach einer Woche vollkommen zerlegt. Hab´s immer wieder nachgeschaut. Kann man dann mal prima im Geschichtsuntericht für das Paradebeispiel eines  ins seriöse Mäntelchen verpackte Anstpropaganda benutzen. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Das Internet vergisst nichts! Kann ein Segen oder ein Fluch sein. Kommentar um es kurz zu halten nur zu Italien, weil das zu Anfang gleich Thema war. ISS-Chef Silvio Brusaferro sagt 96% der Erkrankten, starben nicht an Corona laut Pressekonferenz vom 22.05.20 vom  Gesundheitsministerium Italiens. Ja, ich denke... Italien hätte es nicht gemerkt, dass das Virus für eine Pandemie verantwortlich ist. Ich sehe dass die "Verschwörungstheoretiker"  vom Volk vielleicht verhöhnt werden, aber immerhin haben sie mit den Zahlen recht. Und wer mag schon Besserwisser! </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Ich glaube dem Herrn Lesch kein Wort und das ganze Video ist nur dazu da sein Klickvolumen ( damit die Kasse ordentlich klingelt) zu erhöhen, wie bei vielen anderen auch. Der Inhalt wird reisserisch angekündigt, und verpackt, dann auf den Fake-Zug aufgesprungen, weil der ja (leider ) sehr viele Anhänger hat, und fertig ist der leckere sinnfreie Mix, der sowieso nicht bewiesen ist. Und Corona nur ständig statisch zu diskutieren mit Zahlen halte ich schon lange für absolut fehl am Platze. Was nutzen die ganzen Statistiken ?Die sollen nur am Ende alles so verdrehen wie es die Herren gerade brauchen und um sich selbst zu beruhigen. Fakt ist: Wer Pech hat, und einer von 0,0001 % ist, hat die Arschkarte und kann seine Tage zählen.  Wäre der Virus nur 15% letaler, würde jeder hier nur zitternd hinter seinem Ofen sitzen und nicht mehr raus gehen. Aber jetzt, wo man es (dank Italien % Co) noch einigermassen abwenden konnte, tönt jeder gross rum und verdreht die Tatsachen, und wundert sich, warum wir (noch) unterbelegte Betten haben..... Das widerum wird dann als Psuedo-Beweis genommen ,dass es "nicht Schlimm " sein kann, und heruntergespielt als wäre das alles nichts Besonderes. Ein Beweis der schneller in sich zusammen fallen kann wie ein Kartenhaus..... Zu allem Überfluss fängt der deutsche Michel an sich wegen ein paar lächerlichen Corona Regeln und Massnahmen in Demos zu organisieren, wo man gegen Beschneidung von Grundrechten meckert. GEHTS NOCH ? Alleine durch die Tatsache, dass diese Leute dorthingehen, keine Regeln einhalten oder sie ignorieren, haben sie selbst allen anderen gezeigt, dass sie nicht fähig sind alleine unter eigener Verantwortung auch für die Mitmenschen zu handeln, und somit eine solche Krise zu verstärken. Damit haben solche Leute nichts anderes verdient als bevormundet zu werden, und die Regierung hat völlig zu Recht die "Erziehung" in diesem Falle vorzugeben ! Ja, und das obwohl wir eigentlich eine Demokratie sind. Aber in extremen Ausnahmefällen sollten gewisse Dinge wie Grundrechte oder Datenschutz  (natürlich in angepasster Dosierung)   ausgehebelt werden können und müssen !! Denn leider haben wir zu viele hirnlose, die sich anmaßen das alles schon selbst zu schaffen und ihre eigenen Regeln etablieren zu wollen. Daher waren alle Massnahmen meiner Ansicht sogar noch viel zu lasch und wachsweich, genau wie unser Justizsystem.  Sarrazin hatte absolut Recht: Deutschland schafft sich in JEDER HINSICHT ab. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Genau, Sie sagen es ja ganz richtig : " Haette man das Sars - Cov nicht entdeckt, dann waere uns der Ausbruch der Pandemie gar nicht aufgefallen ". Hier haetten Sie das Video besser abbrechen sollen, denn alles Andere sind reine Verschwoerungstheorien. Naemlich die der Mainstreammedien. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> In diesem Land stinkt es Gewaltig!!!!!! </COMMENT 20>

Merci, prenez soin de vous ! :) </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Je rappelle juste que H1N1 faisait peur à l'époque tout comme le SRAS, le MERS et actuellement le COVID-19. Le problème, c'est que les trois précédents ont été géré de façon à ce qu'il n'y ait aucun confinement. Concernant le COVID-19,... C'est bien plus qu'un simple scandale d'État, c'est le Scandale du siècle.

Pour rappel, le SRAS de 2003 et le MERS de 1992 au Moyen Orient étaient aussi des coronavirus tout comme l'actuel COVID-19. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Bonjour,
Je suppose qu'on ne me lira pas, mais rien de grave, besoin d'écrire une pensée, une idée de faire.
Et si on élisait un anonyme au prochaine présidentielle qui démissionnerait dès sa prise de fonction. Puis se représenterait ensuite pour un deuxième mandat et redimensionnerait à nouveau. On présenterait toutes les 2 élections (2 mandats oblige) un nouveau candidat qui démissionnerait encore et encore jusqu'à ce que les autres décident enfin de laisser la place. Faire que le vote blanc deviennent concret.
Pendant les phases de démission, ce serait régions, départements, communes qui seraient à la barre (décentralisation forcée).
On m a souvent dit que pour changer les choses il fallait le faire de l'intérieur... pas évident, l'intérieur contamine ou désespère. Là, on leur enlèverait leur jouet jusqu'à ce qu'ils consentent à le prêter. Bloquer uniquement les joueurs du haut, laisser agir et penser ceux du bas.
Moi, je ne peux obtenir 500 signatures, pas assez connu. Mais je suis près à être cette anonyme et à ne pas parler au nom des français. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Hélas, le meilleur sujet traité depuis le début de cette période, et avec moult références! Pourquoi ne pas avoir titré simplement que le COVID 19 est une crise écologique?? C'est ce que je pense depuis le début; que ce virus soit naturel ou de synthèse, cela ne change rien à cet état de fait que presque personne n'ose souligner. Quant à mon interrogation sur ses origines, il est certain que les causes réelles seront longues à mettre en évidence... Toutefois, je pense que connaître l'information qui a fait paniquer l'ex-ministre de la santé est à rechercher en priorité (;-) </COMMENT 4>

<COMMENT 9> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPpoJGYlW54&t=336s Des animaux viennent du monde entier pour alimenter ces marchés industrialisés, de 54 ESPÈCES de bêtes sauvages. En 2004, cette industrie vaut 100 MILLIARDS de dollars. Très intéressant pour le gouvernement chinois. En 2018, cette industrie a atteinte 148 MILLIARDS de yuans. La Chine est exhortée à stopper ces marchés définitivement.
 Quatre mois après l'apparition du Covid-19 dans cette ville du centre du pays, les marchés de rue ont rouvert malgré une réputation sulfureuse qui leur vaut des appels à la fermeture depuis l'Australie ou encore les Etats-Unis. Si l'Organisation mondiale de la santé (OMS) a appelé les Etats à INTERDIRE la vente d'animaux sauvages, elle n'a pas plaidé pour la fermeture des marchés. https://information.tv5monde.com/video/coronavirus-en-chine-wuhan-rouvre-ses-marches </COMMENT 9>

<COMMENT 17> Terre fille du soleil
Boule de feu tu fu
Puis jaillit de l’espace la douche bienfaisante
La douche incessante des comètes chargées des prémices de la vie.
Du temps lourd de ces milliards d’années apparue le vivant
La mer fille de la terre fit du vivant le berceau 
De ce berceau naquit au point culminant de l’évolution : L’humanité
Puis ne cessa de croître et d’évoluer l’être humain en nombre et intelligence
Si nombreux et si peu respectueux qu’il fit dépérir le tissu vivant de la terre
Ce tissu que l’on nomme biodiversité avait été la mère nourricière de l’humanité passé
La mère terre se vengea sur ses enfants en vomissant des tempêtes, des ouragans et des virus
Fiévreuse elle pleura de la tête au pied des larmes de glaces fondantes
Sur le cimetière de l’humanité poussa alors la fleur de l’espoir 
Le signe avenir de l’harmonie naissante entre les humains ,les animaux et le monde végétal. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Que les chercheurs en biodiversité défendent leur emploi, je le comprend (même si ça ne relève pas des activités essentielles..) mais leur exploitation de l'émotion actuelle est particulièrement cynique. La peste, la variole, le choléra, la tuberculose (et j'en passe!) auprès desquelles le COVID19 est une plaisanterie, sont apparues à l'âge d'or de la biodiversité. La disparition de la peste est passée par l'éradication (partielle, hélas) des puces et poux. La leçon qu'on pourrait tirer de ce verbiage, c'est qu'avant d'aménager une zone naturelle, il faut éradiquer les espèces sauvages (notamment les chauve-souris!) qui s'y trouvent. </COMMENT 18>

<COMMENT 1> PAP have too much power within their cabinet. No accountability for their mistakes at all, they just do whatever they want and pushed for their ideas. Why are we implicated to do this just because of the sheer incompetence of the ministers? </COMMENT 1>

<COMMENT 4> Let see what will happen when restriction are to be lifted for traveler coming to Singapore . Look at the neighboring countries and western countries , cases are not slowing down. 
Definitely there will be some traveler contracted with Covid with no symptoms.Unless government lock down again.
You can trace until next years,You can implement all the rules and idea that you like ,you will still get numbers of cases everyday. 
Having precaution measures is good , beyond that is just too much of a hassle.

Il timore che il virus possa infettare di nuovo persone guarite è tra le principali preoccupazioni a livello globale. Per Jeong Eun-kyeong, direttore dei Centri per il Controllo e la Prevenzione delle Malattie, il virus potrebbe essersi "riattivato", piuttosto che avere infettato di nuovo un corpo guarito da precedente contagio. </COMMENT 17>

<COMMENT 5> Garlic won't help cure COVID but it's properties will have an effect on dealing with subsequent bacterial infections caused by it. Garlic has been demonstrated to be a powerful natural antibiotic. If Antibiotics had no effect, doctors wouldn't be using it for COVID patients. Obviously you shouldn't eat 3 pounds of the stuff in one go, but there's no harm in taking normal quantities of Garlic in addition to regular treatment. It has nothing but positive effects on the body. </COMMENT 5>

<COMMENT 10> It is so sad that people would risk their lives with stupid and potentially lethal at home “remedies’ on a disease with a relatively low mortality rate. This is what happens with media scare-mongering.😢 That being said, I am extremely grateful for this channel and these videos as I am deathly afraid of allopathic doctors  and would rather risk my life riding it out at home and venturing into “home cures”. But these videos also scare the crap out of me and give me great pause. Many many thanks! </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> the sad part, dude had to make a video to remind folks dont drink bleach. we make society too safe for the least amoung us. it would be a tragedy for a family to lose a child ( i personally cant imagaine it) but ...... maybe some kids shouldnt make it to adulthood and add to the gene pool. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> I've had a few friends who have become compulsive hands washers.  This is a problem because their hands have become dried and cracked and painful.

<COMMENT 4> <COVID-19 TRUTH>
*Most people won’t get the virus.*
*Most of the people who get it won’t display symptoms.*
*Most of the people who display symptoms will only be mildly sick.*
*Most of the people with severe symptoms will never be critically ill.*
*And most of the people who get critically ill will survive.*

This is borne out by the numerous serological studies which show, again and again, that the infection fatality ratio is on par with flu.
( https://swprs.org/studies-on-covid-19-lethality/ )
There is no science – and increasingly little rational discussion – to justify the lockdown measures and overall sense of global panic.
Nevertheless, it’s always good to get official acknowledgement of the truth, even if it has to be leaked.
Here are three leaks showing that those in power know that the coronavirus poses no threat, and in no way justifies the lockdown that is going to destroy the livelihoods of so many.
1. “IT’S ALL BULLSHIT!”
On May 26th Dr Alexander Myasnikov, Russia’s head of coronavirus information, gave an interview to former-Presidential candidate Ksenia Sobchak in which he apparently let slip his true feelings.
( https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/05/27/its-all-bullsht-russias-coronavirus-information-chief-says-of-virus-fears-a70398 )
Believing the interview over, and the camera turned off, Myasnikov said:
It’s all bullshit […] It’s all exaggerated. It’s an acute respiratory disease with minimal mortality […] Why has the whole world been destroyed? That I don’t know,”

<COMMENT 11> “Despite Moderna’s cheery press release this week, the clinical trial results for its groundbreaking COVID vaccine could not be much worse.”
“The vaccine, developed and championed by Anthony Fauci and financed by Bill Gates, used an experimental mRNA technology…”
“Three of the 15 human guinea pigs in the high dose cohort (250 mcg) suffered a ‘serious adverse event’ within 43 days of receiving Moderna’s jab. Moderna…acknowledged that three volunteers developed Grade 3 systemic events defined by the FDA as ‘Preventing daily activity and requiring medical intervention’.”
“Moderna allowed only exceptionally healthy volunteers to participate in the study. A vaccine with those reaction rates could cause grave injuries in 1.5 billion humans if administered to ‘every person on earth’.” (Robert F Kennedy, Jr., Children’s Health Defense, May 22, 2020, “Vaccine Trial Catastrophe: Moderna Vaccine has 20% ‘Serious’ Injury Rate in High Dose Group”) </COMMENT 11>

<COMMENT 13> The CDC has proven this to be unnecessary as of 5 days ago. The virus does not spread easily on surfaces so this video is just bad information at this point. </COMMENT 13>

<COMMENT 19> I posted this Doctor's tips on carefully cleaning, wiping down your groceries after you came home..posted in a lot of places,
Coming back now on May 31st, after watching MSNBC, a physician mentioned posts like this in passing to stress its HANDWASHING and SOCIAL DISTANCING which are most important.
He said wiping down your groceries and other tips making the rounds are basically OVERKILL, that there isn't really much evidence from CDC and other researchers showing this is a length of carefullness going too far.  No real evidence that wide virus spread through SURFACES is not what they're seeing.
As to me, after leaving stores, I DO wash my hands with alcohol based hand washing, but not wiping down every product anymore.    
Thanks anyway, to this physician Jeff Van Wingen for having us be more careful, even if too cautious about 'sterile technique.'   I would only suggest that this level of care is not widely reported by CDC as of May 2020.   Stay safe, of course.  But cheesh...keep wearing your masks when shopping  where ya get close to people or touch them. </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 10> Pessoal, comam bastante ALHO CRU e/ou cápsulas de ÓLEO DE ALHO pois tem efeito comprovado como ANTI-COAGULANTE. Não previne que ocorra a infecção, mas pode evitar que chegue à insuficiência respiratória causada pela coagulação nos vasos sanguíneos dos pulmões. É sério, divulguem para todo mundo. Vamos salvar vidas. Infelizmente só o que dá Ibope falar sobre medicamentos, pois tem que vir dos grandes laboratórios. Não desmerecendo a contribuição deles.

<COMMENT 14> REFLITA SE QUISER (Leia Até o Fim - 5 minutinhos de Leitura) - O que está acontecendo em nosso país é uma Guerra Política - só não entende isso quem não quer entender, seja por Hipocrisia ou por Ignorância. Na mídia brasileira está escancarada o teor político dessa pandemia, diferentemente de outros países. No Brasil, infelizmente é um jogo político)

O Coronavírus existe? Sim

O Coronavírus mata? Sim

O Coronavirus é de fácil proliferação? Sim

O Coronavírus é só uma gripezinha como alguns dizem? Não. Por que se fosse só uma gripezinha pessoas não morreriam.

Qual a origem do Coronavírus? Segundo “os cientistas” é originário do animal morcego, cuja carne é consumida por chineses. Morcegos infectados pelo Coronavírus foram consumidos por seres humanos (chineses). A partir daí com a movimentação de pessoas pelo mundo o Coronavírus se alastrou causando uma pandemia.

Desde quando os chineses consomem carne de morcego? Não sei dizer, mas acredito que eles não começaram a comer carne de morcego em 2019 e por este motivo confesso que não acredito que a origem deste COVID-19 tenha origem na carne de morcego. Na minha opinião esse vírus foi criado em laboratório.  

Com relação à China:

O quê aconteceu com os médicos e jornalistas chineses que tentaram avisar a população sobre algo estranho que estava acontecendo nos hospitais chineses? Será que foram abduzidos? Por quê a mídia não explora esse assunto? Os Direitos Humanos Internacionais têm explorado este assunto? 

Os números de mortos e infectados divulgados pela China são confiáveis (só lembrando que os dados divulgados por um “regime de governo ditatorial” nunca são confiáveis)? 

A economia chinesa se abalou com essa pandemia? Como está a balança comercial da China? Suas exportações aumentaram?

O quê se esperar de um país (China) cujo “presidente” já afirmou que pretende tornar seu país (China) potência mundial até 2050, sendo este país (China) capaz de influenciar qualquer outra nação? 

Até que ponto os testes que vem da China são confiáveis? Ou melhor esses testes são 100% confiáveis?

Com relação ao Brasil:

O Coronavírus é motivo para causar pânico na população? Não sou médico e muito menos Infectologista por este motivo não sei responder. Mas a mídia brasileira tem causado pânico nas pessoas com imagens de cemitérios, valas comuns e retroescavadeiras. Inclusive a mídia foca muito no número “absoluto” de mortos. Dá até impressão de que antes dos coronavírus não havia mortes no Brasil. Fato: Uma coisa é morrer DE COVID-19, outra coisa é morrer COM o COVID-19

Quantas pessoas morriam diariamente por motivos como câncer, violência (doméstica, assaltos, assassinatos, etc...), dengue, acidentes de trânsito e outras causas, no Brasil antes da pandemia do COVID-19? 

Muitos projetos que beneficiariam o povo brasileiro forem enviados pelo executivo ao congresso nacional. Antes da pandemia o Brasil era um país “quebrado”, “sem recursos” e com “limitações de gastos”. De repente são aprovados créditos extraordinários e orçamento de guerra para “combater a pandemia”. Foi criado o “auxílio emergencial” para pessoas que realmente necessitam. Milhões e Milhões de reais foram aprovados no congresso para ajudar pessoas desempregadas e trabalhadores autônomos por exemplo. Será que todo o recurso do “auxílio emergencial” vai chegar nas mãos de quem realmente necessita? Será que tem pessoas sendo beneficiadas por este “auxílio” sem necessitar? 

R$ 600,00 é suficiente para sustentar uma família por um mês: (pagar: aluguel, luz, água, telefone, internet, vestir, higiene e se alimentar)? As cestas básicas fornecidas por muitas prefeituras são suficientes? Participei da montagem de uma cesta básica que será entregue para alunos do Ensino Municipal Básico do município onde moro e me recordo que cada cesta básica era composta por um saco de arroz de 5 kg; um saco de feijão de 1 kg; um pacote de leite de 2 kg; um extrato de tomate de 1 kg; um pacote de macarrão; um pacote de granola de 1 kg; dentre outros poucos itens que não me recordo agora. 

Os milhões de reais destinados a hospitais e hospitais de campanha “destinados para combater a pandemia” estão sendo empregados com eficiência e efetividade? Agora “o país” sente na “pele” a má gestão de recursos por parte de governos anteriores. Ao invés de terem investido em hospitais preferiram investir em estádios para a Copa do Mundo. Resultado: estão construindo hospitais de campanha (gastando mais recursos) dentro dos estádios. 

Os recursos destinados pelo governo com a finalidade de se combater o COVID estão sendo empregados com plena eficácia e efetividade? Infelizmente já temos notícias de corrupção como no caso dos respiradores dos hospitais do Rio de Janeiro.

As medidas de restrições de circulação de pessoas adotadas por muitos governadores e prefeitos tem sido benéficas para a população? Em muitas cidades com o objetivo de reduzir a circulação de pessoas foi também reduzida a quantidade de ônibus coletivo em circulação. Além disso, foi adotado o regime de rodízio de placas de veículos. Com isso o transporte coletivo sobrecarregou ainda mais causando aglomeração de pessoas.

Mas por que as pessoas continuam saindo de casa mesmo com “os governos”, “mídia”, “médicos”, e “cientistas” dizendo que a melhor coisa a se fazer no momento é ficar em casa para evitar a proliferação do COVID-19? A resposta é simples. Porque comida não nasce na geladeira e no armário (dispensa). Se a pessoa não trabalhar ela não recebe dinheiro. Se não receber dinheiro ela não compra comida. Se ela não compra comida ela fica com fome e deixa os filhos com fome. (Usei o exemplo da comida, mas lembre-se que as contas de luz, água, telefone, internet, aluguel, remédios, fraldas, etc... vão continuar chegando)

Pra quem tem o salário garantido todo mês na conta bancária (principalmente servidor público e políticos); Pra quem tem geladeira, dispensa e freezers cheios de comida é fácil dizer: “FIQUE EM CASA”. (Hipocrisia)

O quê será dos patrões sem os funcionários e vice-versa? E os estoques parados nas prateleiras cheias de produtos com prazos de validade? E os pontos comerciais que são alugados? Será que o dono do imóvel vai congelar o recebimento do aluguel? E o vendedor que ganha por comissão? O que será dele se a loja onde vende roupas e calçados está fechada? Será que o patrão vai continuar pagando o salário dele? Será que o auxílio emergencial supre a necessidade dele? 

Até quando ficaremos em casa?

Até quando os casamentos serão adiados?

Até quando ficaremos sem poder nos reunir com os amigos num barzinho?

Até quando não vamos poder nos hospedar em um hotel a beira-mar nas férias com a família?

Até quando essa pandemia terá um teor político escancarado na mídia brasileira?

Até quando meu Deus, até quando....?

O pior vírus é o da ganância por dinheiro e poder!!!

Siga as orientações dos órgãos sanitários e dos governantes.

<COMMENT 1> Según he visto, este medicamento se debe tomar en los primeros síntomas, antes de que la infección baje a los pulmones, porque después ya no es muy efectivo porque las células de los pulmones necesitan una dosis muy superior y se convierte en peligrosa. Ahora bien, mi duda es acerca de la dosis que debe tomarse. En algunos sitios dicen que 3 pastillas de 6mg y repetir a las 2 semanas o a los 10 días, pero en otros lugares dicen que dos pastillas cada 24hrs durante 2 días, e incluso otros dicen que se tomen 4 pastillas juntas en dosis única. Ojalá alguien pueda resolver mi duda. </COMMENT 1>

<COMMENT 2> The hypocrisy, this demonstration of social awareness and caring drives me mad. If they really gave a shit maybe they could advice consumers that during this pandemic a healthier choice, full of vitamins and nutrients in order to boost your immune system is the way to go. But no, they do care. About their bottom line. And all these companies are doing the same, taking people for brainless idiots. Swallow the crap they shovel down your throat, over pay for it and keep smiling. </COMMENT 2>

<COMMENT 1> Denmark stands with you! help the nurses, respect the nurses... respect those who help <3 </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Your freedom of speech and other freedoms stop when they put others at risk or infringe on someone else's rights. Im a free speech absolutist and a second amendment absolutist unless you're a violent felon etc, but I was crying for martial law in every county..the majority of the country could have been back up and running months ago had we locked down 'airtight' immediately. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> I'm literally for a trump supporter to come and say something idiotic in the comments. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Wait till one of them catch the virus and go to the hospital where they see the nurse they harassed and the nurse says NOPE OUT </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> is it bad that when the dude who made the Facebook post got corona and died I yelled "karma sucks doesn't it" </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> it's ok to leave your house now! </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> These people grew old but they didn't grow up </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Every single one if them are gonna get covid-19 </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Why are nurses even attending the protests barley anyone is following proper guidelines they suppose to be in the hospitals saving people ? Instead they take a big chance contracting a virus in large groups </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> I felt kinda bad to seeing this :( Good job, nurses! All the doctors and nurses are doing great job around the world. Thanks! Without you and your hands a lot more people would die. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> If the protesters get coronavirus just dlnt give them treatments </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> 00:03 she is the virus to society </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> A plan of the lying demoncrats </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> 2020 is certainly not the United States’ year, what a mockery of a first world country </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> All I can think about while watching this video is how embarrassed these protestors will feel if they had the virus and needed the nurses help from this hospital; needed help from any hospital or anyone in general. It’s a very scary world we are living in right now. Fighting each other will only set us back further; spreading COVID and killing those who are compromised, over a haircut? Peacefully protest for productive change, stop attacking those who are risking their own life to help others keep theirs. There is a better way than these actions. Please do better, America. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> 0:01 that is the biggest Karen I’ve ever seen </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Sadly these protests are all around the world. Along with Corona parties these are one of the most selfish things these people have ever done. Rights go along with responsibility. And Noone has the right to remove a governor etc just because he doesn't like him/her, because they are not representing everyone's will, just theirs. Stuff like that is called a military dictatorship and has nothing to do with freedom. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> You mean the Fake nurses, that got caught staging a photo op. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> I don't think I have enough words to describe what is going through my head. Also I don't think I can, there aren't enough curse words. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Where's the media criticizing the George Floyd protesters for not social distancing and attacking first responders and motorists? If you can say these folks don't care about nurses then can we say these nurses don't care about the economy, rights or all the medical practices closing because of the lockdowns? They're suing Governor Whitmer. Also Fauci changed his stance on the lockdown </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 1> Me gustaría saber qué va a pasar y cómo van a manejar el asunto de los aires acondicionados en empresas, centros comerciales, etc., a los cuales generalmente no les dan mantenimiento y no los limpian y sólo circulan una y otra vez aire sucio; y también quiero saber qué pasará con las oficinas en donde todo el espacio está cerrado, no tienen ventilación natural y precisamente hay puro aire acondicionado, pues en ese tipo de espacios se vicia mucho el aire, como comúnmente dicen "huelen a humanidad". </COMMENT 1>

<COMMENT 6> Las barreras mismas pueden ser un foco de infección que ni en las mismas unidades del IMSS se han implementado, ni entre los  mismos pacientes ni en las oficinas ni en los escritorios de las clínicas, hospitales ni oficinas del seguro.

<COMMENT 1> Unfortunately, the downloadable pattern/instructions are poor. Steps 1-3 tells you to sew the curves and then steps 4-5 instructs to sew the straight sides down but it looks like the straight sides are being sewn together making opening them up impossible. Please revise those instructions or consult both a beginner and a professional to make sure the instructions are correct and doable for beginners. </COMMENT 1>

<COMMENT 3> Thank you for this video and instructions. We're learning how to make these today, as a family, from Watford, UK. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Recommend a mask manufacturer, price: 0.14 USD / PCS, and only 7 USD for 50 PCS!! FDA test passed, which registration serial number is 10062936. You could confirm it on the FDA website, it’s ok for medical or surgical usage. Contact email: stephenyaftersale@ foxmail or website: superyouke.com.

I did some deep investigation and all the information from this supplier was in line with my requirements. This is the first mask manufacturer that has truly passed all tests and is willing to provide the original certificates since I have bought so many masks from different sellers on Amazon, who were either too expensive or too bad quality.

I ordered 50,000pcs and contacted the local UPS for delivery. It only took me a week to send me to STOCKTON, CA and my tracking number is 1Z5586Y20466890012.

The reason I ordered this amount of face masks is that we do have an urgent need for this. I have raised its price a little and made a little money for the spent time and energy. If this information is useful to you, please vote for me. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> I have been using this pattern with a small adjustment. I use the Face 1 & 2 (2 of each makes the front and inside). I use the Mouth peace to cut an interfacing from Pellon's Tyvek. Sew the Mouth peaces to the inside Face peaces. (This replaces having to change a filter) Tyvek is waterproof and breathable. The only place I have found to purchase it is JoAnn's. And I use hair bands purchased at the Dollar Stores for the ear peaces.
This makes a very nice mask that is comfortable to wear and it is washable. Tyvek says it should be air-dried. I had a lady tell me she washes her mask it the top shelf of her dishwasher. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Hard to see which side has the folded seam - Guess more experienced sewers would know.  Wish fabric had been one you could tell wrong side from right side so the seamed side would be more visible. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> First of all, I like the cute guy sewing. Secondly, I love this pattern because of the ease of access of this filter pocket. Other filter pockets in masks only have the opening on the top or one side and it makes it difficult to insert a filter and get it to sit in there properly. The design of this one makes it so easy, plus it's super easy to insert a nose wire and remove it to wash the mask! I wish I'd found this video sooner instead of trying a million other ones first. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> 3 ply mask 1.75 indian rs contact +91 6354702958 </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Mask takes longer than 5 to 10 minutes to sew.
The edited video is nearly 20 minutes and doesn't show cutting of pattern pieces.   Also I would recommend using clips instead of pins... creating less holes in the fabric for microns to pass through. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> In just 3 min you can learn this
https://youtu.be/eWzpbtQTqls </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> I may be missing the point but, besides saving a little bit of fabric, what is the advantage of the short cheek piece and the added complexity?  More commonly the cheek piece is cut the same shape and size as the outer piece, the mouth piece is cut and finished as in the video, all 3 pieces are then sewn all the way around.  That way you don´t have to worry about the correct overlap of the short cheek and mouth pieces.  Less work and you still end up with the same filter pocket, the same access for inserting a nose wire, and the added benefit of 3 layers of fabric in front of the mouth instead of just 2 layers. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Is there a good way to enlarge this for a man's face? This fits me perfect but doesn't quite fit his face. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> It is a good idea to wear a cloth face mask when you are around others during COVID-19. We cover our faces to protect others, a cloth face covering is an act of compassion. In other words, no reason not to. They can be comfortable and, look awesome. </COMMENT 13>

<COMMENT 19> Im attempting to make this mask tonight. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Are you using the curved part of this Olson facemask as the nose or to cup the chin?   I'm finding the curved part cups the chin nicely, but Im just wondering what the intent was. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 1> Denmark stands with you! help the nurses, respect the nurses... respect those who help <3 </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Your freedom of speech and other freedoms stop when they put others at risk or infringe on someone else's rights. Im a free speech absolutist and a second amendment absolutist unless you're a violent felon etc, but I was crying for martial law in every county..the majority of the country could have been back up and running months ago had we locked down 'airtight' immediately. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> I'm literally for a trump supporter to come and say something idiotic in the comments. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Wait till one of them catch the virus and go to the hospital where they see the nurse they harassed and the nurse says NOPE OUT </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> is it bad that when the dude who made the Facebook post got corona and died I yelled "karma sucks doesn't it" </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> it's ok to leave your house now! </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> These people grew old but they didn't grow up </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Every single one if them are gonna get covid-19 </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Why are nurses even attending the protests barley anyone is following proper guidelines they suppose to be in the hospitals saving people ? Instead they take a big chance contracting a virus in large groups </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> I felt kinda bad to seeing this :( Good job, nurses! All the doctors and nurses are doing great job around the world. Thanks! Without you and your hands a lot more people would die. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> If the protesters get coronavirus just dlnt give them treatments </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> 00:03 she is the virus to society </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> A plan of the lying demoncrats </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> 2020 is certainly not the United States’ year, what a mockery of a first world country </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> All I can think about while watching this video is how embarrassed these protestors will feel if they had the virus and needed the nurses help from this hospital; needed help from any hospital or anyone in general. It’s a very scary world we are living in right now. Fighting each other will only set us back further; spreading COVID and killing those who are compromised, over a haircut? Peacefully protest for productive change, stop attacking those who are risking their own life to help others keep theirs. There is a better way than these actions. Please do better, America. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> 0:01 that is the biggest Karen I’ve ever seen </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Sadly these protests are all around the world. Along with Corona parties these are one of the most selfish things these people have ever done. Rights go along with responsibility. And Noone has the right to remove a governor etc just because he doesn't like him/her, because they are not representing everyone's will, just theirs. Stuff like that is called a military dictatorship and has nothing to do with freedom. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> You mean the Fake nurses, that got caught staging a photo op. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> I don't think I have enough words to describe what is going through my head. Also I don't think I can, there aren't enough curse words. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Where's the media criticizing the George Floyd protesters for not social distancing and attacking first responders and motorists? If you can say these folks don't care about nurses then can we say these nurses don't care about the economy, rights or all the medical practices closing because of the lockdowns? They're suing Governor Whitmer. Also Fauci changed his stance on the lockdown </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 1> Me gustaría saber qué va a pasar y cómo van a manejar el asunto de los aires acondicionados en empresas, centros comerciales, etc., a los cuales generalmente no les dan mantenimiento y no los limpian y sólo circulan una y otra vez aire sucio; y también quiero saber qué pasará con las oficinas en donde todo el espacio está cerrado, no tienen ventilación natural y precisamente hay puro aire acondicionado, pues en ese tipo de espacios se vicia mucho el aire, como comúnmente dicen "huelen a humanidad". </COMMENT 1>

<DESCRIPTION> Sewing Fabric Face Masks Thank you for your interest in sewing fabric face masks. This video features the healthcare creators of the Olson Mask. NOTE: These ... </DESCRIPTION>

<COMMENT 1> Unfortunately, the downloadable pattern/instructions are poor. Steps 1-3 tells you to sew the curves and then steps 4-5 instructs to sew the straight sides down but it looks like the straight sides are being sewn together making opening them up impossible. Please revise those instructions or consult both a beginner and a professional to make sure the instructions are correct and doable for beginners. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> If you not able to made at home
You can buy covid-19 protection mask
https://amzn.to/3eNzmFf </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Thank you for this video and instructions. We're learning how to make these today, as a family, from Watford, UK. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Recommend a mask manufacturer, price: 0.14 USD / PCS, and only 7 USD for 50 PCS!! FDA test passed, which registration serial number is 10062936. You could confirm it on the FDA website, it’s ok for medical or surgical usage. Contact email: stephenyaftersale@ foxmail or website: superyouke.com.

I did some deep investigation and all the information from this supplier was in line with my requirements. This is the first mask manufacturer that has truly passed all tests and is willing to provide the original certificates since I have bought so many masks from different sellers on Amazon, who were either too expensive or too bad quality.

I ordered 50,000pcs and contacted the local UPS for delivery. It only took me a week to send me to STOCKTON, CA and my tracking number is 1Z5586Y20466890012.

The reason I ordered this amount of face masks is that we do have an urgent need for this. I have raised its price a little and made a little money for the spent time and energy. If this information is useful to you, please vote for me. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> I have been using this pattern with a small adjustment. I use the Face 1 & 2 (2 of each makes the front and inside). I use the Mouth peace to cut an interfacing from Pellon's Tyvek. Sew the Mouth peaces to the inside Face peaces. (This replaces having to change a filter) Tyvek is waterproof and breathable. The only place I have found to purchase it is JoAnn's. And I use hair bands purchased at the Dollar Stores for the ear peaces.
This makes a very nice mask that is comfortable to wear and it is washable. Tyvek says it should be air-dried. I had a lady tell me she washes her mask it the top shelf of her dishwasher. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Hard to see which side has the folded seam - Guess more experienced sewers would know.  Wish fabric had been one you could tell wrong side from right side so the seamed side would be more visible. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> First of all, I like the cute guy sewing. Secondly, I love this pattern because of the ease of access of this filter pocket. Other filter pockets in masks only have the opening on the top or one side and it makes it difficult to insert a filter and get it to sit in there properly. The design of this one makes it so easy, plus it's super easy to insert a nose wire and remove it to wash the mask! I wish I'd found this video sooner instead of trying a million other ones first. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> 3 ply mask 1.75 indian rs contact +91 6354702958 </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Mask takes longer than 5 to 10 minutes to sew.
The edited video is nearly 20 minutes and doesn't show cutting of pattern pieces.   Also I would recommend using clips instead of pins... creating less holes in the fabric for microns to pass through. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> In just 3 min you can learn this
https://youtu.be/eWzpbtQTqls </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> I may be missing the point but, besides saving a little bit of fabric, what is the advantage of the short cheek piece and the added complexity?  More commonly the cheek piece is cut the same shape and size as the outer piece, the mouth piece is cut and finished as in the video, all 3 pieces are then sewn all the way around.  That way you don´t have to worry about the correct overlap of the short cheek and mouth pieces.  Less work and you still end up with the same filter pocket, the same access for inserting a nose wire, and the added benefit of 3 layers of fabric in front of the mouth instead of just 2 layers. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Is there a good way to enlarge this for a man's face? This fits me perfect but doesn't quite fit his face. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> It is a good idea to wear a cloth face mask when you are around others during COVID-19. We cover our faces to protect others, a cloth face covering is an act of compassion. In other words, no reason not to. They can be comfortable and, look awesome. </COMMENT 13>

<COMMENT 18> Wow…nice video. If you can't make a mask yourself, I recommend you buy from this website polloo.com. I have bought some masks. The quality is not bad. I hope it might help. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Im attempting to make this mask tonight. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Are you using the curved part of this Olson facemask as the nose or to cup the chin?   I'm finding the curved part cups the chin nicely, but Im just wondering what the intent was. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 1> We the people, all Canadians are responsible for how we treat one another, and globally.  All of this is not on the government alone. So all of you stop pointing fingers do your part.  Everyone need to look in their own backyard before you throw stones. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Get past the PM's silence.  What is the fixation with his silence? </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Yes, because the main ppl who were most susceptible to catch it already caught it. So of course new cases are declining. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Everyone stopped caring about corona/quarantine.. everyone is out and about.. and cases magically disappear. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Following orders of elite SOB </COMMENT 5>

<COMMENT 12> bla-bla speach for baby </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> You still not identifying the actual problem!!! Racism, discrimination, are only side effects of hate and greed. The best weapon of hate and greed is the way we worship/live for   money </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> How about our front liner? Are they getting some money too? These heroes risk their life every single day to treat and care patients.  And no extra pay for them. While others stay home and receiving money. They deserve to get double pay or any kind of bonuses. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Sad place, cases are decreasing, I’m afraid of working in health care, and this country doesn’t control the situation well at all, whereas many country still do good. Pathetic over-optimistic poor country. </COMMENT 15>

<COMMENT 1> Me gustaría saber qué va a pasar y cómo van a manejar el asunto de los aires acondicionados en empresas, centros comerciales, etc., a los cuales generalmente no les dan mantenimiento y no los limpian y sólo circulan una y otra vez aire sucio; y también quiero saber qué pasará con las oficinas en donde todo el espacio está cerrado, no tienen ventilación natural y precisamente hay puro aire acondicionado, pues en ese tipo de espacios se vicia mucho el aire, como comúnmente dicen "huelen a humanidad". </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Primero que nada, no he visto a Blanquita Valadez y a otros pseudo periodistas groseros y mentirosos en las conferencias y la verdad ¡¡¡¡¡qué bueno!!!! Gracias a Dios que se omitan, no hacen falta para nada. Sigan quedándose en su casa porfa!!! Ah! Y omítanse de los medios de comunicación porque la verdad no aportan nada de valor. </COMMENT 2>

<COMMENT 6> Las barreras mismas pueden ser un foco de infección que ni en las mismas unidades del IMSS se han implementado, ni entre los  mismos pacientes ni en las oficinas ni en los escritorios de las clínicas, hospitales ni oficinas del seguro.

<COMMENT 19> Hi, like to have family here in  malaysia? come here, i will be your god father. 

i think big clue to this achievement is politician listened to health Director (dr Noor hisham), we imposed lockdown, a few areas with high numbers infected EMCO, (total non movement), so food provided for them as well as those in needs also in other area. many persons / NGO raised up to help (many more unregistered or just formed)  take it to themselves the problem around them, just like me(mr nobody, don have much, but more than enough for a few months due to donations from friends) so i took care of 10 families, and become a "bridge"/ mr postman for a few more families, while friends actually provided the money,  so these families head dont have to break MCO (stay home order), to go to work. We know govt could not cover all problems, just ask "what can i do to help", to ensure people stay home

But we are not free yet from this pandemic, WHO estimate it wont go away for the next 5 years, plus vaccine is not available, most likely  until end of next year. so pls do what you can to stop the virus, minimal, stay home </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Hi, FYI, I'm one of a foreign worker that live in Malaysia for years..and what shows in the video is true, specifically in large state like Kuala Lumpur..well, I live somewhere not far, I mean around an hour from there but in another state, our employer still provide us with jobs and foods even asking for helping them for helping others who's not so, well, poorly people and provide them with daily basis necessities...well...I like living here just because theirs is 'rich' in time like this..you know what I mean..so yeah, bye </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 15> First mask that I made , they cover well , easy to understand instructions , I have made so many . Thank you ! </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Made two already. Kinda messed up the second time around but I love it. Making more </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Having fits trying to put the pleats in and work around the two inner pieces where they overlap and the folded part of those pieces.  I have tried doing the middle one first then the other but the area where the two overlap and the seams just doesn't come out right.  Does anyone have any pointers that will help?  Would it help by making the inner pieces longer, say 14-16 cm instead of 13, so the folded edges be further apart? </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> I found it a lot easier to place the elastic in position first then hand stitch the final turn - a much neater job I thought! </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> F </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> How to make the Easiest Patterns: If you have a glass place near you.... Get the pattern cut from CLEAR PLEXIGLASS 3/16" - Then simply lay your pattern down on top of your fabric and position it exactly where you want it and use the roller razor cutter and cut each side ---- stopping right before the corner... take the glass off and snip the corners with the end of your scissors. This is just so that you don't over cut each side and waste fabric. Do you know how awesome fast this is? I make all my smaller project patterns in this way. Made my world a whole lot more simplified by saving me so much time. Blessing to each of you. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 1> Nobody wants to reopen the economy anymore </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> I’m afraid of an uncertain future. I don’t know if i can survive. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> The economics of the virus.  This is what happens when a morally corrupt society is aided and abetted.  We could have a much more fully comprehensible by population inclusion in prosperity with morals because slavery would not exist and our environments would be safe.  I mentioned that the lower pollution allowed me to walk more last week.  Yesterday, I had to use my professional 3M aspirator like the one on my home page picture.  The pollution was close to 50 versus the 2? when I posted last week.  As soon as I took the aspirator off to smell the air, my back began to tense up so badly I didn't feel like walking.  I put the aspirator back on and voila, tension gone.  I don't know if it's just the physics of pollution displacing oxygen or the nerve effect of the pollution on breathing, probably both.  Also, on the walk, just like in my neighborhood, I was sexually harassed by four men.  One spit at me.  A marked increase in aggression with the pollution.  Funny, I don't torture anything or anybody when the pollution increases but the morons of the world that get paid for their contribution are permitted this heinous luxury whenever.  I've had the police here four time this summer and I don't know if I'll bother calling them again.  Officer McMichael said "So what" in response ton my neighbor's illegal fire burning when I called about mental harassment, theft, vandalism, and trespassing and refused to speak with the probable culprit for prevention's sake.  That's the kind of attitude that brought us the virus and police brutality in the long run.  Everybody is just going to keep their mouths shut until there is a horrible irreversible disaster we cannot recover from without creating worse slave nations like communism for instance, the only other choice. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> It is seemingly sad for me because here in my country we cannot sooner replace manual labors into automatic machine which means we STILL need humans to do on the spot job. Operational working space where they needs someone's accuracy to finish a work surely cannot be replaced directly. So im 100% agree with his strategy to do four days work and 10days lockdown and self quarantine. In case some people accidentally infected right before they go to work a day after, this is the company's effort to maximize their health protocol so they can avoid second infection before those infected people start working again and send them home to quarantine theirselves and allow who passed or un-infected to do their regular works. Slowly but sure we can regrow our economy and no more layoffs or homeless people because of this pandemic 🙏🏻 </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> It seems to be a good concept, but how will it work towards getting the economy back to normal? </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> I would love that the government of my country pay attention at any proposal that people of the world is trying to figure it out to return to normal. Argentina, in fact, Buenos Aires and sorroundigs, with less than 1000 deaths, is in Q since March 20th.... </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> How about wearing masks for a start? </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> How do i reach out to Uri Alon for a Webinar invitation in the Philippines? </COMMENT 8>

<COMMENT 12> The exit strategy is to turn off your television and live your life. We all know now that the numbers were wildly overestimated to induce fear and panic for political reasons as well as to push the vaccine agenda. Event 201 and Lock-Step pg.18 will tell you all you need to know about their new world order plans. Bill gates and Fauci have a vested interest in giving every man, women, and child their poisonous and dangerous vaccines. If they get their way you won't be able to do anything without an immunity passport. And once the contact tracing app is baked into the phones your every move will be monitored. We all know the tests are faulty and that the death certificates are being changed to raise the number of covid19 deaths. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> The US does not need to worry about a second wave I guess. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> I may be wrong but there is no real evidence suggesting hygiene and masks + travel restrictions with rigorous quarantine and testing would not be enough to keep the growth rate of the virus below 1. China seems to be doing well, Taiwan too, South Korea as well, even Sweden without any formal lockdown didn't fare horribly bad. If people are too dumb to use proper hygiene and masks (given those are available), it is just natural selection doing its thing. </COMMENT 14>

<COMMENT 17> 4, 10 hour days every other week sounds interesting.  But that cuts your personal income by 1/2.  How do your pay your Rent or Mortgage?  Do people who live in rural areas really need this at all if the “R” value is less than one? </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Less obesity would lessen hopsitalizations. Hopefully, people will begin to take better care of their health. In America, more than 70% of the population is overweight. Fourty million smoke. These are vulnerable patients. Obesity and smoking are curable simply with cease and desist. </COMMENT 18>

<COMMENT 4> I have a popular virus prevention and control idea, which can be achieved only by developing a mobile phone software. There is no need for a large number of police to retrieve camera records to track those who are potentially infected!

 The local area signal is enabled by default on the mobile phone, and the distance between the two mobile phones is 0.5 meters, which leaves a connection record in the software of the two mobile phones.  The duration of historical records is the epidemic incubation period.  In this way, everyone's mobile phone has a record of contact with others for a period of time.  These records are usually useless, but when one of them is diagnosed with an epidemic, those mobile phones that have been in contact with him for 0.5 meters in the past period automatically show that they are close contacts.

 ‪In addition, according to the doctor's inference of the patient's infection time, the date length of the 0.5-meter sensor record can be adjusted in the mobile phone epidemic contact tracking software to accurately obtain the data of all potential infected people who have been in close contact with him.  This is my idea for epidemic prevention and control.  There is no need to allow a large number of police to retrieve camera records to track the infected person. </COMMENT 4>

<TAGS> ['latest News', 'Happening Now', 'CNN', 'us news', 'world news', 'coronavirus', 'chris cuomo', 'cuomo prime time', 'covid-19', 'green card'] </TAGS>
<COMMENT 1> America sucks. That is.. USA. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> WTF?? </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> The reason she wasn't issued a green card is because the new administration has drastically cut the number of green cards for H1B visas, which seems that she falls in to. Citizens of specific countries, predominantly India were applying and getting a high number of H1B visas and once they arrived, changed that into a green card and stayed. When the new administration took the grabs on power, it didn't only not like immigration, but also saw the number of H1B to green card converts, which in itself seems a betrayal. The entire scenario may have played a role in not issuing green card to this physician since the numbers have been dramatically cut/. This also means, a model from another country may get a green card because there may not be so many who have applied yet. Her lawyer can petition and request the USCIS to give a detailed response as to why she wasn't issued a green card! </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> WHY ON EARTH WOULD YOU FIGHT TO STAY IN THE U.S?? I MEAN, CANADA? EUROPE?  You help their people and they deny you entrance. Screw them. Seriously. Screw them. They don't deserve you. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> You’re too good for our country right now. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> I will marry her for papers tell her </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> God bless this amazing woman. Let's get a petition started for her! </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> She's beautiful tho!?. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> I am sure that if America doesn’t want her, Australia would welcome her with open arms.  But I am sure America will accept her and once again Trump will have to eat humble pie. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Why should we be praising the president and Karens and Kevins who demand haircuts, guns, Starbucks when we should be praising these poor healthcare workers who are working their asses off and putting themselves in mortal danger to keep us safe?
And this is the thanks they get. "Go to China" "My rights" "My gun rights" "Commie". 
Karens and Kevins, theses are the same people who gave you advice on how to lose your blubber and help you stay fit  in your bathing suit so that you'll show off your body at the beach right now. And telling them to go to China is your way of saying thank you? Oh please...

It's like how Trump insulted POWs. They were in mortal danger and he victim blames them. This is why I'm losing faith in this country. </COMMENT 10>

<COMMENT 1> J'espère que la vidéo vous plaira, j'ai essayé de faire un condensé des points importants sur cette épidémie et surtout appuyé sur l'importance des règles d'hygiène, et notamment pourquoi elles sont importantes. Si vous n'avez rien appris avec ma vidéo je suis pour une fois content, ça voudra dire que vous avez compris l'enjeu actuel. bon visionnage et faites attentions a vous ! </COMMENT 1>

<COMMENT 6> Crise économique... 
Perte de confiance envers le gouvernement... 
Économie qui passe devant la santé...

Moi je dit après le covid 19 le monde va changer profiter de vos proches on sait jamais </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Moi c’est pas le corona virus qui m’a fait peur, mais les gens. 
Regarder en Amérique il ont commencé à acheter des armes. 
Pourquoi ? Alors la aller leur demandez. 
Ou encore ( là je rigole pas c’est vraiment vrai ), les forces de l’ordre observent nos moindres déplacement, parce que comme des idiots, ont mais sur Facebook : est regarder aujourd’hui je suis ici. 
Ah oui et l’école. 
enfaite les enfants ont les prends pour des fourmis. 
On leur fais un carré, et on leur dit: ne dépasse pas se carré. 
C’est inquiétant pour leurs sociabilisation avec les autres personnes. 
Enfaite ont leurs apprend à devenir insociable. 
Le président. 
Rhooo sa va il a dit comme pour cernoville ( je sais pas comment ça s’écrit ), il a pas le passeport, il peut pas passer les frontières. Mais bien sûr.
😑eh bien voilà maintenant ou ont en est. 
Est le gouvernement il va se servir comme excuse du coronavirus, de rajouter des restrictions ridicules. Comme la liberté d’expression des chaîne YouTube, ex: byoblu. Qui t’informe sur des choses, qu’à la télé tu n’entendra jamais . 
Et bien sûr il essaye par tout les moyen de les fermer c’est chaîne YouTube .
Bon il y’en a tellement, elles vont pas se fermer de si tôt .
Enfaite, je ne veux pas vous critiquer puisque je me critique moi même,
Ont a été un peu trop crédules sur se coup là. 
Ons est même pas sûre que le de nombre de mort est vrai. Même si ( il a été approuvé par un étudiant de Harvard )
Il y’en a qui peut même être mort d’autre chose.
Ne me critiquer pas. 
Juste donner votre avis, faite vous votre opinion de cette situation.
Est c’est pas pour gratter des likes, c’est juste pour donné mon point de vue. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> "Nous serons en confinement total pendant 2 semaines comme en Italie" BAHAHAHA ça fait 2 mois :issou: </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Tu balayes bcp de théories dans l'intro sans arguments c'est pas un travail d'enquête ça </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Toi qui a déjà produit une très bonne vidéo sur Casasnovas, serait-il possible de parler du cancer que lui et ses pôtes (Schaller, Crèvecoeur, etc...) sont en train de répandre sur internet? Je suis extrêmement inquiète de voir les absurdités qu'ils répandent être adoptées et partagées par des gens, hier encore, raisonnables...
Ces malades ont gagné une audience phénoménale pendant le confinement. Si toi tu t'attaques au sujet, ça pourrait contre-balancer... </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> à quand ep 2 sur le déconfinement ? </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> nautre  gouvernement  c'est  de la merde  wola  on dit  au  français  de respect  les  distance   de sécurité alors  que personne  respecte les disance   de sécurité  alors  que  le  peuple  sans  branle   notre gouvernement  est  torp  lacsicte   on est foutu  c'est moi qui  vous le dit    le peuple  français  sont  cons  on leur  dit de respecter  les  règles   le  peuple  fais  tout  le  contraire  
est il bon nous  enculer  a  sec  le 11 mais    on est foutu  c'est moi qui  vous le  dit   parceque  le peuple est  cons (des putin  de moutons) pour la plus pare .... </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Loll Arrête c'est juste une grippe pas la peste noire... Comme à chaque grippe saisonnière il y a des morts c normal malheureusement. La question est de savoir s'ils vont nous mettre tous en confinement à chaque fois qu'il y a une grippe... Ou à chaque soulèvement social important. "Un peuple qui est prêt à sacrifier un peu de liberté pour un peu de sécurité ne mérite ni un ni l'autre et finira par perdre les deux." -Benjamin Franklin </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Etant dans le milieu médical et paramédical, j'ai accès directe de ce qu'il se passe dans les hôpitaux, laboratoires, cliniques....etc par des collègues ou des amis. Je peux vous assure que même si vous êtes jeune et en bonne santé, le virus ne vas pas vous épargnez pour autant. Pensez à votre entourage mais aussi aux personnel soignants qui sont se sacrifie littéralement pour la population qui semble s'en foutre complètement. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> ce qui est egoiste cest de reduire la qualité de vie de 8 milliard de personne pour quelques personne a risque, cest eux le probleme pas nous </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Tu avais raison en vrai </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> merci de ta vidéo, c'est là ou l"on voit la mentalité de la plus part des français qu'ils ne regardent que leur propre nombril,car oui cette épidémie va faire très mal en santé et économiquement  car pour certaines personnes le confinement durera jusqu'à l'apparition d'un traitement et l'économie risque de mettre pas mal de temps à reprendre ,c'est pire que le crac boursier de 2007 et cela touche le monde entier les frontières ne seront pas ouvertes sitôt,et la seule préoccupation de nos concitoyen c'est de pouvoir partir en vacances cet été et que les bars et restaurants ré-ouvrent,enfin merci à toi mais pour l'instant j'ai du mal avoir la sortie du tunnel à+ </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Je m'eppelle Mathilde on on s'en fou ai 11 ans j'ai même pas commencer ma vie que on doi plus sortir et pire les enfant qui vienne de n'être 😂😂😂😂 </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> OK le virus à pris une ampleur énorme au niveau mondial depuis ce temps, c'est impressionnant
Cependant quand on regarde les statistiques et le profil des personnes ayant des symptomes graves voir des personnes décédés, je n'ai pas vraiment peur de l'attraper.
Je respecte bien évidemment les règles de confinement et d'hygiène pour mes proches et pour les autres, mais ce virus ne me fait pas stresser... </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> J'ai 10 ans et je suis diabètique esque je devrais avoir peur ne plus sortir 😷🤔 </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 1> Il ne réalise pas que toute cette réponse a été orchestrée par le deep state qui veulent vacciner la planète et nous mettre sous surveillance à des fins de contrôle. Bill Gates a pris le contrôle de l’Organisation Mondiale de la Santé et a su diriger les efforts dans ce sens. Les fausses statistiques, la suppression des protocoles médicaux tels que la chloroquine, les masques, la distance sociale, semer la panique, la crémation immédiate sans autopsie,  étirer la courbe le plus possible sans aucun bénéfice autre que de donner du temps de développer un vaccin qui ne servira à rien, etc etc cette pandémie mie a été créée de toute pièce. Voir Event201  et surtout avait été prédit par le fameux Dr. Fauci qui détient des intérêts financiers dans des produits pharmaceutiques. Conflits d’intérêts sites-On?

<COMMENT 7> Chacun peut aller voir les études disponibles sur le site de l'IHU: elles sont nombreuses ne démontrent pas du tout l'efficacité du protocole Raoult, car la plupart traitent d'un autre sujet (Hors-Sujet), ou sont des travaux en éprouvette/in vitro (c'est inutile, on veut des résultats in vivo), et au final, la seule étude qui pourrait prouver l'efficacité de ce protocole porte sur 1,061 malades mais sans aucun groupe contrôle, ce qui rend l'étude totalement inutile puisqu'on ne peut pas comparer ces résultats à un groupe-test. L'IHU met en ligne plein d'études mais c'est de l'enfumage, et rien ne prouve l'efficacité du protocole Raoult.https://www.mediterranee-infection.com/pre-prints-ihu/
E1- étude sur la contagiosité (HS)
E2- étude sur la charge virale de 80 personnes (faible valeur statistique) sans groupe contrôle (on ignore si le traitement est efficace ou pas).
E3- traite de la contamination des enfants (HS)
E4- test in vitro (aucun intérêt, car on veut des résultats in vivo)
E5- compare taux mortalité entre 2019 et 2020 dans le sud-est (étude locale + HS)
E6- la fameuse étude sur 1061 malades, mais sans groupe-test donc ça ne prouve rien (le taux de mortalité est "bas" mais comparé à quoi?)
E7- test in vitro (aucun intérêt, car on veut des résultats in vivo)
E8- étude qui critique une autre étude (n'apporte rien de nouveau)
E9- étude sur la toxicité de HCQ+AZI (HS)
E10- étude qui critique d'autres études qui prouveraient que l'HCQ et AZI ne sont pas efficaces (la plupart des études sont disqualifiées sur la base de biais alors que les études de Raoult ne comportent aucun groupe-test, ce qui est le plus gros de tous les biais! lol)
E11- test sur la détection du virus (HS)
E12- mesure de la contamination chez les SDF (HS)
E13- étude sur la performance des microscopes (HS)
E14- étude sur l'isolationd des virus (HS) </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> La chloroquine est connue depuis 50 ans pour n'avoir aucun effet anti-viral sur les êtres vivants (vous pouvez vérifier, tous les chercheurs du monde le disent), et contre le SARS ou le MERS (qui sont aussi des coronavirus) personne n'a jamais utilisé de chloroquine (logique). Jusqu'au jour où le Pr. Raoult a déclaré que la chloroquine associée à l'azythromicine était soudainement devenue efficace contre le coronavirus. Ah bon? Mais quelle étude prouve cela? Parce que maintenant y'a tellement d'études qui prouvent que quelque soit les combinaisons HCQ/ AZI et quelque soit l'état du patient (critique ou symptomes moyens) le "protocole-Raoult" ne sert à rien, que faudrait d'abord que Raoult nous fournisse une étude scientifique solide qui prouve que son protocole fonctionne avant de nous emmerder avec propos mensongers...

<COMMENT 2> He is not capable of leading this Province  his leadership has had more interest in corporate businesses masking his real interest.  When he became Premier of Ontario  He cut billions of dollars from Healthcare.  I myself was a victim of his brutal cuts.  I have been waiting to have surgery done for 1/1/2 years now.  Now Since this Virus began I don't expect to even hope for a long time.  I don't think I have a chance to live by the time it's my turn in line . </COMMENT 2>

<COMMENT 1> Hi! This was very informative and the information is still applicable it seems (June 4). Thanks.

I had COVID19 type symptoms in mid-March, though I tested negative. Don't know if it was just out of my system or I had something else. Anyway,  this information prompted me to be sure to use asthma medications (inhaled): corticosteroid to keep inflammation down.  My physician eventually put me on Montelukast, which is great for me.

Just FYI for anyone reading: I use a tracking device on my rescue inhaler (Propeller). It is free from the site (Google Propeller). A phone app allows you to track triggers, frequency and it even gives reminders for you to take/use medications.

  The graphs it created of my rescue Inhaler use since August 2019 (hardly used) showed how much more often I needed it in March. I shared these with my doctor. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> He's incredible. I wish more people would listen </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> <COVID-19 TRUTH>
*Most people won’t get the virus.*
*Most of the people who get it won’t display symptoms.*
*Most of the people who display symptoms will only be mildly sick.*
*Most of the people with severe symptoms will never be critically ill.*
*And most of the people who get critically ill will survive.*

This is borne out by the numerous serological studies which show, again and again, that the infection fatality ratio is on par with flu.
( https://swprs.org/studies-on-covid-19-lethality/ )
There is no science – and increasingly little rational discussion – to justify the lockdown measures and overall sense of global panic.
Nevertheless, it’s always good to get official acknowledgement of the truth, even if it has to be leaked.
Here are three leaks showing that those in power know that the coronavirus poses no threat, and in no way justifies the lockdown that is going to destroy the livelihoods of so many.
1. “IT’S ALL BULLSHIT!”
On May 26th Dr Alexander Myasnikov, Russia’s head of coronavirus information, gave an interview to former-Presidential candidate Ksenia Sobchak in which he apparently let slip his true feelings.
( https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/05/27/its-all-bullsht-russias-coronavirus-information-chief-says-of-virus-fears-a70398 )
Believing the interview over, and the camera turned off, Myasnikov said:
It’s all bullshit […] It’s all exaggerated. It’s an acute respiratory disease with minimal mortality […] Why has the whole world been destroyed? That I don’t know,”

<COMMENT 5> Someone says to us corona virus is nothing but a kind of a flu. Today I have really, truly understood that is not the case. It,s a very much dangerous  disease against which we have to be alert as much as possible, because it will causes  ARDS to us, and which will be seriously critical for us.  You are great!!! Today, on May 30,  2020, I have watched your video clip. Thank YOU from Japan. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> I’m watching this on 31st May and everything he said 2 months back is exactly what’s happening now! I hope in India things get better really soon.
Thanks for the important info Doc. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> i got the virus and am afraid it's gonna kill me here overseas, 😭 😭 </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Thanks for this vital important information dr. Vuong this is some serious times we are living in we need people like you to tell us the truth about this virus. Please keep bringing us this important information.stay safe and stay blessed.😊🙂🤔 </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> This guy is JOKE </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Now India has 166K COVID19 case. The USA has 1.76M </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Ominous to see this once we actually have reached 1 million cases. Thank you for getting information out there! </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Man! You were so damn wrong. It was not 20K people died bc of this virus like u said. The number just passed 100K. I got a feeling that US government intentionally let the virus spread wildly to weed out the old, the weak and the sick to reduce the cost of health care. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Dr. what is your opinion on the patent list which follows (includes implications)  . .from Alfred Lambremont Webre’s research, a list of patents from the last decade:

US7220852B1 Modified Human Corona virus. Holder: CDC. 2003
(our own govt Center for Disease Control)

US20060257852A1 SARS Holder: Glaxosmithkline 2004
(Pharmaceutical company)

US8343506B2 Chimeric Chikunguya virus Holder University of Texas. 2010

US10130701B2 Corona virus chimeric genetic manipulation Holder Pirbright Inst. 2014

EP3172319B1 VACCINE for Corona virus Holder: Pirbright Inst. 2014. (Pirbright Inst. funded by Bill and Melinda Gates Fdn.)

US579246A Virus Replication system. Chimeric Holder US Army

WO200806347A2 Nanobots RF A! control of humans. Holder: Neil Solomon 2006.

Okay summary ...
On these patents, some are obvious, some you have to read between the lines... but the purpose is to show irrevocably that technology exists and that things have been done that are denied and lied to the public by the Mainstream Media (MSM)

A) So here is proof the virus was a bioengineered weapon 😎
B) That the law was broken to develop "gain of function" by Chimeric research
C) That a vaccine already existed before the COVID19 outbreak. 
D) that Nanobots are in the vaccines.
E) that nanobots are being sprayed thru aerosols (Chemtrails)
F) that these nanobots can be programmed to kill someone very rapidly
G) that these are/can be activated and controlled by (EMF) Electromagnetic energy Radio/microwave transmission - i.e. 5G technology.
H) that A.I. (Artificial Intelligence) control can/will be initiated thru these means.
I) that the coming crypto- currency will depend on you having the bots, and will monitor your every move. etc, etc etc....

<COMMENT 19> Hi, like to have family here in  malaysia? come here, i will be your god father. 

i think big clue to this achievement is politician listened to health Director (dr Noor hisham), we imposed lockdown, a few areas with high numbers infected EMCO, (total non movement), so food provided for them as well as those in needs also in other area. many persons / NGO raised up to help (many more unregistered or just formed)  take it to themselves the problem around them, just like me(mr nobody, don have much, but more than enough for a few months due to donations from friends) so i took care of 10 families, and become a "bridge"/ mr postman for a few more families, while friends actually provided the money,  so these families head dont have to break MCO (stay home order), to go to work. We know govt could not cover all problems, just ask "what can i do to help", to ensure people stay home

But we are not free yet from this pandemic, WHO estimate it wont go away for the next 5 years, plus vaccine is not available, most likely  until end of next year. so pls do what you can to stop the virus, minimal, stay home </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Hi, FYI, I'm one of a foreign worker that live in Malaysia for years..and what shows in the video is true, specifically in large state like Kuala Lumpur..well, I live somewhere not far, I mean around an hour from there but in another state, our employer still provide us with jobs and foods even asking for helping them for helping others who's not so, well, poorly people and provide them with daily basis necessities...well...I like living here just because theirs is 'rich' in time like this..you know what I mean..so yeah, bye </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 3> how much did you fold and press lining in the beginning? </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Lovely. Want the mini iron too!
Where to buy? </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> What that clip is called as? </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> i made one for my sister! the folidng part was the most difficult, but I did it!! </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> I keep looking for the measurement for the elastic. Anybody? </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Not having a wire in the nose does not keep protective seal (or safety), and allows for hot breath to go up and fog the wearer’s glasses.    But it’s better then nothing. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> That little iron❤ </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> All must see

<COMMENT 13> Cute and easy </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> i find mask    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYgj18Zlc2Y </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> First mask that I made , they cover well , easy to understand instructions , I have made so many . Thank you ! </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Made two already. Kinda messed up the second time around but I love it. Making more </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Having fits trying to put the pleats in and work around the two inner pieces where they overlap and the folded part of those pieces.  I have tried doing the middle one first then the other but the area where the two overlap and the seams just doesn't come out right.  Does anyone have any pointers that will help?  Would it help by making the inner pieces longer, say 14-16 cm instead of 13, so the folded edges be further apart? </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> I found it a lot easier to place the elastic in position first then hand stitch the final turn - a much neater job I thought! </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> F </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> How to make the Easiest Patterns: If you have a glass place near you.... Get the pattern cut from CLEAR PLEXIGLASS 3/16" - Then simply lay your pattern down on top of your fabric and position it exactly where you want it and use the roller razor cutter and cut each side ---- stopping right before the corner... take the glass off and snip the corners with the end of your scissors. This is just so that you don't over cut each side and waste fabric. Do you know how awesome fast this is? I make all my smaller project patterns in this way. Made my world a whole lot more simplified by saving me so much time. Blessing to each of you. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 1> Merci mille fois de Melbourne, Australie. Je viens de réaliser mon premier masque ! Le zig zag n'est pas très régulier (l'antique machine ne voit le jour qu'une fois tous les xxx ans ! ) mais le résultat est génial. Merci pour un présentation facile à suivre et une présentratrice très agréable. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Merci beaucoup pour votre tuto. Vous faites preuve d'une grande pédagogie. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> J'aime bien vous explications , vous êtes claire pédagogue , super merci . Un conseil vous êtes très loin une G ... , ne dites pas de mal de vous , et sans doute apprenez à vous aimez mieux !   bravo et merci </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> merci votre tuto est très réussi et j'ai pu faire à l'identique et ma petite famille est bien contente on espère que tout le monde pourra se protéger </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Pour ceux qui n'ont pas de machine a coudre
Très bien expliqué </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Tip Top merci beaucoup et merci aussi au Caméraman pour son intervention perspicace et il faut bien le dire des plus adorable...vous formez une bonne équipe! Prenez soin de vous. </COMMENT 6>

<COMMENT 10> Merci pour ce tutoriel </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> bonjour merci pour ce tuto je viens de faire mon 1er masque  tres simple </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> très clair comme explication- il me faudra bien un jour ou deux pour un faire  un sans machine mais bon je vais essayer. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Vous n'avez pas d'élastique un bas en voile (collant) fait très bien l'affaire et on peut le nouer à la taille que l'on veut </COMMENT 13>

<COMMENT 16> Merci pour le tuto , très contente de ma réalisation ce matin </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> on nous dit toujours que les masques protègent les autres de nos postillons. Mais alors quel type de masque nous protège des postillons de ceux qui n'en portent pas justement. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> génial ! moi je suis méga débutante et là c'est nickel clair ! merciiiiiiii !! et sérieux vous êtes loin d'être gourde ! je dirai "humaine" :) </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Votre tutoriel aurait été mieux si vous aviez utilisé 3 épaisseurs de coton puisque la plupart des gens n'ont pas de popeline de coton 120 fils. A part cela,  j'apprécie que vous ayez en main le dossier de la norme AFNOR. Beaucoup de couturières qui font des tutoriels ne l'ont pas, n'y font pas référence et ne l'ont probablement même pas lu. Leurs masques ne sont donc pas conformes. C'est navrant. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Un grand merci pour ce tuto. J'aime les détails et le rythme... J'en ai regardé un par une pro de pro... Trop rapide pour moi. Je n'ai rien retenu. Bravo et merci. (Une très très très gourde) </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 1> Even if the lock-down achieved the goal, so what? We started this travesty based upon MILLIONS of potential deaths, and, it turns out, that was NEVER going to happen. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> interesting </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> So since the lockdown will not stop the disease in the long run it is going to run its course anyway once the lockdown is lifted, the lockdown has not saved any lives it is in fact cost more lives. People who did not receive the normal Medical Care they would have gotten because they were locked down, people who committed suicide, people who starved to death in poor countries, and the list goes on and on the people who would not have died if there were no lockdown. The lockdown it's actually killed more people in the long run </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Lockdown is not sustainable for any country , this lockdown is just putting off the inevitable. We are all gonna run of money and credit soon. What are we do we do then? I am very worried about that. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Dr. Jay Bhattacharya: what is your view about hydroxychloroquine together with zinc in the early stages of infection? </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Interesting interview.  Everyone can agree that the number of Covid-19 cases depends on the number of testing, and is not meaningful.  The only statistics that I trust is the all-cause mortality rate.  The other numbers are debatable.  For example, in NYC the all-cause mortality rate is +225% above seasonal average.  It's useful to find out if the excess deaths are mainly caused by Covid-19 or caused by the lockdown.  This can help us determine what we need to do next. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Throughout entire conversation the immune system was never mentioned.  There are many genius scientists advising immune defense.  Vitamin D3 C A and zinc.  There was a survey of a large group who died from Covid 19. They found extremely  vitamin D  deficiencies in those patients. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> DR BUTTAR EXPLAINS ABOUT COVIT19 
PLEASE. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Capitalism and national health care do not mix. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Trying to understand:  People should self-isolate if they feel they are at risk. We do not have to mandatorily shut everything down. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Very good Covid19 info session...  BEST so far </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Heaven help me, DJT? I’m out at 33:06. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> If I wanted to know what the main stream media reports to be the case, I would watch CNN thank you. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> You wasted your work. Covis-19 is not total population based and any study based on general population should be discarded. The study population should be based on senior popution. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Covid-19 is old age related. You are not including age griuos. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Is this antibody test soecific to Covid-19? What did you find about age specific group orevalence? </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> You may as well let it run it’s course and deal with it now </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Warmer weather promotes vitamin D because people get more sunshine in warmer weather.  Those deficient in vitamin D have been shown to suffer far more in other studies. </COMMENT 18>

<COMMENT 2> I'd rather build my own immunity and risk death than risk a vaccine from CCP, no thanks. Made in China is always defective or broken or makes people sick. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Have you heard the last safe virus thing China did is infecting Millions of people? Have you heard their vaccine program has had a terrible safety record leaving children paralyzed and dead? How about after the COVID Virus is the food safe according to their own news?

<COMMENT 5> China is truly a land of honor! </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> And The Peoples Republic of China offered this vaccine as a global cure, working with serious goverments around the World. At very low cost and free to poor countries.
That's how you fight Corona Virus.
Go China. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> China work closely with friendly countries only. Unfriendly countries will sabotage your products. Never be soft, be like USA and outspoken </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Hope this vaccine is successfull, all the best China 🇨🇳 </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> ALL CHINA HAD TO DO WAS TO LISTEN TO THE CHINESE WHISTLEBLOWERS THAT WARNED CHINA IN THE BEGINNING,  ACT FAST, TELL THE TRUTH, WORK WITH OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE BEGINNING, NOT GIVE OUT ANY MISINFORMATION AND KEEP A CLOSER EYE ON YOUR VIRUS CONTROL PROGRAM!!!!!!!!!   CHINA DID THE OPPOSITE AS TO MAKE SURE THE VIRUS WOULD SPREAD AROUND THE WORLD!!!!!!!!!!!! </COMMENT 9>

<COMMENT 14> @Public Health England - your description above has the links the wrong way around for donning & doffing for AGPs! </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> If detergent (soap) and hand gel are so encouraged and spectacles can just be wiped, how come the eye protective mask, which I assume is plastic? and similar to spectacles, cannot too be washed in detergent or wiped with gel even though it is in front of the spectacles to be used again as it is such a waste to see a plastic eye mask being disposed of after just one patient use.   In an Age where plastic pollution is high on Political and Social Agenda, are we not using fabric Aprons that can be washed, like uniform, at high temperature in detergent and then re-used (as in the old days) because the virus left on a plastic apron will be rife in the bin for how long?    Not good surely each time you open the bin to add more plastic aprons and gloves, virus may 'pop out'??    Also if the Aprons are plastic then they are wipeable so why not wipe them down with disinfectant wipes and re-use, again, if detergents and alcohol wipes are so effective as we are constantly informed......I see mass waste that seems over the top in some areas and then no masks in others where there is risk.....not medical so maybe I just dont understand but the plastic aprons dont cover all uniform after all. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Hence 1 in 3 NHS key workers test positive for Covid 19. What a joke. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Is there a way to download this video, or does Public Health have the file available to download anywhere? </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> if you're looking for some disposable or kn95 masks, try here: www.kn95masksdirect.com i just placed an order but we'll see when they arrive... </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> PHE is rubbish! </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Why, compared with the previous guidance you put out 4 weeks ago, have the precautions been downgraded? Does PHE know something about covid-19 that other countries don’t? Do we have a strain that is less contagious and less deadly in the U.K.? Why has the PPE risk assessment been found to be less dangerous than it was before, what has changed? What is the evidence base for this? Respiratory precautions for influenza were previously FFP3 mask, long sleeved full coverage gown and gloves. How can it be different for Covid-19, when it is both more deadly and more infectious than flu? </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 1> Consejo cuando trasmitas el vídeo guarda silencio porque interrumpes cuando hablan en el video habla cuando termine el vídeo consejo y ojalá lo tomes me gustan tus vídeos suerte </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Tenes que dejar de interrumpir a cada rato, por favor!!! </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Incluso si las personas supieran la verdad aún así no acatarían las medidas respectivas para frenar está pandemia. Si con el poco conocimiento que se brindó no lo hacían, no esperemos mucho... Lamentablemente este mundo está comenzando a caerse a pedazos </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> 11:31 Desaparecían porque lo decían los medios occidentales. Pero  luego reaparecían y nadie corregía nada, o pocos lo hacían.Como cuando supuestamente decían que mataron a un revolucionario de Hong Kong, y luego salió que el tipo estaba preso porque se había ido al cabaret (Que es ilegal en China) </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Sigo las noticias desde hace tiempo. Los aportes de Trump no importan porque Bill Gates aumentó las donaciones al organismo para cubrir el hueco que dejaba USA. Así que seguimos en la busqueda de una vacuna, a pesar de la tacañería del Sr. Trump que no quiere pagar en avances médicos por un capricho. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Esto es como cuando quisieron Hackear a la NSA y hackearon la NASA. No pudieron Hackear a China ni la OMS, y lo que dicen es Copy-Pasteado de las noticias de USA en la prensa conservadora que obedecen más a lo político que a lo real. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Ni la OMS ni China ocultaron datos, fue propaganda de USA. Además Annonymous siguen siendo los mismos nerdos de siempre con el ego inflado. Yo no los tomaría en serio. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Cris los chinos son super robatizados y justo  este virus se les escapa 
Aca hay mucha informacion 
Que no sabemos 
O.M.S es tan culpable como china </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> OMS, No querían crear pánico, pero si millones de muertes??? OMS: una mala broma. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> La OMS y la ONU no a hecho nada en los ultimos 100 años ni en guerras ni en pandemias hambres falta de agua etc </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Tengo mis reservas de este grupo , tal vez puede ser una distracción mientras ocurre lo importante en otro lugar . ¿ Por qué salen ahora ? </COMMENT 11>

<COMMENT 16> Anonymus es de isquierda y esta contra trump,  solo tira videos fachadas de que es neutral pero en el fondo solo juega a favor o es parte de la isquierda corrupta </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Aquí queda muy claro que la OMS no sirve para nada, al contrario afecta a todos los gobiernos y población mundial sería mejor si no existiera esa organización tan corrupta y para rematar reciben mucho presupuesto el cual podría ser utilizado con mejores fines y no el de perjudicarnos a nosotros mismos. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Estaba esperando este video wey, saludos dese chile. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> X eso uno no confía en los gobiernos mucha gente a perdido su trabajo x esto

<COMMENT 1> No new info then? We know that 80% mild symptoms.. 15% very bad 5% critical 1% of total die .. thanks for reconfirming </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> reason, competence and sanity. nice to see its still around </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> You make it sound as if it was ONE BIG LIE!!!

I can believe that </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> UnHerd: def. people that think they are smarter than the herd. But in reality, are too dumb (and ignorant) to even be part of the herd </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Ok, so if true, only 20% right, not so bad, right?  What if the 20% were shot dead.  How many is that in the US, 60 million?  Would this channel be ok with that?  BTW, kind of disgusting that your group is completely financed by a single British hedge-fund manager that was barred from selling securities because of fraud on his investors.  Do your interviewees and audience know that? </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> "In each country, there appears to be a portion of the population that is ‘not even in the game’ that is, not susceptible to Covid-19. This varies hugely between countries. In the UK, Professor Friston estimates that portion to be at least 50%, and probably more like 80%." I am not sure what he means with  "not susceptible to Covid-19"? They don't have the virus at all or they have the virus but are asymptomatic? Anyways from my article research 30%-80%  of the cases are asymptomatic so maybe that is what he means with "not susceptible to Covid-19". </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Political move by global governments to get order out of chaos just as 911 when it happened, and back when we had the decade's of some of the worst mass shootings, these things are all caused by people in high seats of power,it all has trickled down from a global coo,hoping people are starting to wakeup to what is really happening and going on. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> What a fantastic interviewer! I had almost forgotten what that looks like. Asks the right questions and then actually allows the interviewee to answer without interrupting with their own views. A refreshing change. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> If it was vitamin d Brazil would not have suffered. I think regarding Germany its just that they re very efficient its an efficient country and well managed. They took right precautions and did lots of testing. Nothing to do with vitamin d. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> An article in the TImes said that the low account of virus infection on the Balkans was due to the vaccine inoculation done in the last 40-50 years. Wonder if Germany did have the same vaccinations? </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Strange comparing a Scot with a German on susceptibility in getting the virus. Possibly better comparison would have been between a person living in England and a person living in Germany, given that England’s excess death rate is 3x that of Scotland’s. A discussion on this massive difference between two nations in UK, given so many similar variables, would be interesting. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> If you want to know what a DANGEROUS virus is like when it strikes look no further then the EBOLA outbreak in West Africa,did they lockdown Africa....NO,did they lockdown the countries affected....NO,so where is Ebola now..Oh that’s right it just went away like SARS,bird flu,swine flu etc etc so this lockdown is POLITICAL and designed to create CONTROL thru FEAR and of course create a new medical economy based around VACCINES or as we know them in the real world POISON </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Let's not allow the virus of antagonism to infect us with the disease of hostility and spiritual distance.. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> It was almost painful watching Freddie extract information out of Karl Friston. It seemed to me that Karl was trying very very hard not to tread on the toes of his epidemiological colleagues. His modelling appears to contradict the evidence that led to the lockdown. I can understand that Karl doesnt want to fall out with those he is working with, so he is saying things as gently as he can. The problem is the message is a sledgehammer, difficult to wield softly.

By the way, what is the latest on the the story about unherd videos being taken down by Youtube? Was a video taken down? I cant think of one good reason to take down a second of any of these discourses. Youtube is the human record of the age, and we have to bequeath these discussions, assertions and dissents for future generations to appraise. Any omissions could cause untold harm to those future generations. I hope that these sources remain available to humanity as long as they are needed. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> I'm all for looking at actual data, but all these computer models are bs. They only are as good as the assumptions the person who put the data and factors in. You can't predict the future using a computer or all these modelers would be infinitely rich. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> I'm sorry are you suggesting that the 0.58% of the entire population of Bergamo who died are somehow more susceptible to COVID than their counterparts in, say, Puglia where only 0.0128% of the population died? Even though demographically, culturally and genetically they are practically identical?

Or is there perhaps a shred of possibility that the difference between the two groups can be explained by the time difference between when social changes to reduce R0 were implemented relative to how far their local epidemics had spread and nothing to do with "nation-wide herd immunity".

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.15.20067074v3 </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> I am pleased to hear this news.
It seemed obvious to me that the people of South Korea were not very suspectible to the virus hence low death rates.
I believe that all people who are suspectible to the virus will in time become infected regardless any action by Government
The lock down has only delayed the spread of the virus and NOT stoped it.
The lock down has been the most destructive action on our population as we no longer have a working economy and will have the same number of deaths from the virus in due course.. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> I’m trying to understand one thing. Given that the incubation  period is up to 14 days then 14 days or so into lockdown we might have expected a marked dip in cases ( or the curve) from the effect of lockdown? But we didn’t? What I’m trying to understand is why were people still dying at the rates they were 14-21days into lockdown ? You would expect a delayed effect 14+ days  to lockdown. After 14 days how were people still getting co vid at the same rates and dying? </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Orange man ok. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Social distancing and societal discipline together with early prevention action is why Germany did better with managing the pandemic. Look to New Zealand and Australia if you want to see how effective early management prevented the diabolical mismanagement and unnecessary deaths that occurred in the UK and USA. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 1> As soon as these slack jawed hillbillies open their mouth you know they are willfully ignorant . </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> *Going to the beach is bad. But mass gathering for protesting is good* 🤔🤔🤔🤔 </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Gonna interview these people?

https://youtu.be/SJGT06zIUiY </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> The solution is really quite simple. Treat all offenders like a Citation, no Ticket is given but if they are not Social Distancing or Wearing a Mask if they later contract COViD-19 and seek medical or financial help they will be denied immediately.

All that the Police need to do is start taking names and adding them to a COViD Offences National Database, part of a ‘Pre-Tracing’ solution.

Name, Address, Gov SIN number...easy...

That way all Hospitals, First Responders, Medical Facilities and Financial Facilities have access to those who have committed the Offence.

That’s how you regulate people in to doing ‘what’s right’ </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Well at least hopefully we'll lose a bunch of stupid people </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> It's called herd immunity,as it replicates through it looses it virility just like Rinovirus </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> It was getting better so the left killed George Floyd to start a race war ! </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> The south must be stupid central </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Really, people partying, beachin'? 😒 What's so sad is that most of my countrymen don't wear masks, not because they don't want it, but they can't afford to have one.😔 </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> If Trump ever demands China for compensation for this virus they can just show this video as evidence they were not responsible. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> "You can't fix stupid."  - Ron White
7000 people in the US died from COVID-19 since this was reported.  That's one week ago. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Alabama - where de 27%  black folks at? Not at the beach anyway. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> For those who say that CNN is only targeting people and not the protesters about the coronavirus, they did https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2020/06/01/health/protests-coronavirus-spread-concerns/index.html . </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Darwin's plan for Alabama. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> One week later, CNN did not criticize protesters/rioters who were not practicing social distancing guidelines. Double standard, much? </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> I caught and survived covid19. It's very different from the flu. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Funny their complaining about this and not the fact the protesters don't social distance </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> This is what happens when stupid people breed </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Covid is being spread by Obama and Hillary in a gay-laboratory that's also staging another fake moon landing. </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 1> I watched both videos and I found them to be extremely helpful! It was also nice that it was presented in a calm positive manner. Well done and highly recommended.😄 Dr. K </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> thank YOU for your wonderful videos! I am sharing on a Jazz List -- oh yeah! the South Florida Jazz List! </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Hi Dr. Please do an updated video regarding masks, etc and things we should do as things reopen. Thanks for your helpful calming videos. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> I'd like to thank you for revising your video presentation based on additional knowledge. I had seen the original one and heard you had revised your information but had trouble getting YouTube to allow you to revise/edit the video so you did a new one. Thank you for your efforts to share your knowledge with us. 🥰 </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> After several trips and cleaning of groceries, I can see how someone can develop dermatitis </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Asking the good doctor or a learned person re: the subject matter that has data to back up their reasoning, in this video you didn't address Covid viability in a cold environment. In point of fact, you stated that microbiologists store other virus samples in the cold. I wipe everything down because there is a possibility I will forget. However, as you point out we aren't perfect so I may forget to wipe stuff down. But I'm not going to mind game myself endlessly because that's what the paid for news is for. I will assume that the pathogen remains non food borne. However, I read about bugs in strawberries yesterday.  Thanks for your initial video. I put it to good use in my home and am referring people to this post. Peace, out </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> I disagree about using a service to deliver groceries. I have seen many grocery Pickers and Packers. They are on their  germy cell phones constantly, your items get touched by them, then the cashier then the transport person. Many transport persons then are in contact with many other people- none of whom have any training pertaining to cross-contamination Airborne pathogens or body fluid pathogens. They don't clean their cars in between deliveries and many of them bring family members or helpers.  Ive sern them place bags on the ground also.  The stores are horrible because they were full of these shoppers who are not careful at all. I've Just Seen way too much to ever use that. people will get mad but I'm telling the truth.  it also makes no sense to shorten the hours at the store because now you're forcing everyone to shop together. This is a really nice video for people who have their own homes with private entrances garages or cars. I like the reference to Sparkles because they get on everything in her very hard to get rid of </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Thanks Doc! </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> You are a very kind man, and I'm happy to see you spreading that kindness around. Thank you so much. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Great work Doc.  Pls share about take way u brought to office n bring back home. Tq. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> I have a 90 yr old MOm.  I shop once every 4 weeks.  Bring all perishables into the basement . Wash containers in a dishpan of soapy water.  Then disinfect w/ alcohol..  I then remove my mask, hat , shoes and change out of  clothes and leave all grocery bags in the  basement.  I wash my face , ears and neck (exposed skin).  I do worry about my long hair which I put up into my baseball hat .... can the virus attach to the underside of my hair?   The Bottled and boxed grocery  items I leave in my truck for UV rays to destroy.  They will stay out there until we need them... or  for the four week duration .   Lettuce and Berries are particularly of concern to me.   For carryout... I have 2 big sheet pans ready.  We dump all the food into the sheet pans at the door and one person immediately takes the carryout containers / pizza box to the outside trash can.    I remove all envelopes from mail OUTSIDE at the garbage can.  I always disinfect my hands after touching the outside garbage / recycle bins.   We leave our newspaper outside on the porch in the plastic sleeve for a few days, flipping it so the Sun's UV rays can destroy any virus.   After bringing my dogs from the vet I gave them a bath. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> First - do most of this in the garage or outside the house, what comes inside the house should be clean.  Second -  get a trash can for the dirty bags and cardboard boxes, no need to touch them twice. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Dr. VanWingen, can you please advise on how long the virus may persist in water mixed with laundry detergent?   I have a small portable washing machine and I cannot use hot water - I use a combo of laundry detergent, dishwashing detergent, and Pine-Sol inin the washing machine.  I have no clue as to how much of these to use per gallon of water.  But most useful would be to know how long the virus survives in water mixed with detergent - hard numbers: X many days when the initial water temperature was Y and concentration of (A,B,C,D) detergents was (a,b,c,d) per gallon.  Your answer would save us so many moments of anxiety! Thank you! </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> I definitely would not leave food opened on your counter while you are unwrapping everything else. This virus is .0001 microns big and it can move with the wind.  I would have tops for your containers ready for when you put your food, chicken, chips etc in these containers. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Can you explain more how you handle ice cream or other frozen items you have to put into the freezer. Do you wipe them first. They dont dry are they going to be ok. I notice that your clothes are touching everything. What do you do about them? Do you think it wise to leave your shoes out. How long does the virus stay on clothes. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Great video I have been doing this for weeks forwarding it to friends and family keep safe everyone </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Thand you Doctor.
You are doing your best for millions of viewers worldwide.
🤗🤗🤗 </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> That tomato @12:45 RIP 😂 </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Thanks......my question is what if i dump groceries for 5 days and than use it without washing outer cover etc.? Note - I have stopped using vegetables ;) </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Thank you, Sir! ❤️ </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 1> Estoy viendo esto por que tengo que hacer unas preguntas de tarea jajajaj </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Esto lo vi por la tarea
Nada mas </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Muy bien DR López Gatell animo saludos </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> que pedo y que vamos a comer con que vamos a pagar la renta sin ayudas ni trabajo ni nada  la cuarentena cada vez sé alarga mas y más Ya Nmms </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Dr Gatell usted siempre un caballero, gracias x estar en estos momentos tan difíciles al mando de nuestro gran país como el profesional que es. Segura estoy bcomo muchos q pasara a la historia como uno mas de los grandes.
Y eso no cualquiera. Nadie logrará opacar su trabajo. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Los estados quisieron implementar sus métodos, aquí en Guadalajara ya tenemos más de 70 días guardados y nos piden 15 más, esto ya es un juego político, falta los estragos económicos y psicológicos, que con el tiempo, ya no le darán importancia, porque ya no les será útil a sus fines políticos. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> UN GOBIERNO EQUIVOCADO EN TODOS SUS PRONÓSTICOS  SE GUÍAN POR UNA BOLA DE VIDRIO Y UNA ESTAMPILLA DE LA VIRGEN </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> YA PARA QUÉ? SI EL PEJE YA ESTÁ HACIENDO LO QUE SE LE PEGA LA GANA!!!! </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Muchas graficas se puede o no puede sean concretos mal desempeño del Gobierno viene lo peor desgraciadamente han sido cómplices de teorías mediocres que   serán contundentes para agravar la situación bla bla bla </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Otra vez nuestra negligencia como población no va a meter en una grave situación ya muchos sin cubrebocas en las calles hoy y sin la sana distancia , entiendo que todos necesitamos el pan en la mesa,pero si este gobierno federal no es corrupto y ladrón porque no apoyan con efectivo a la gente que no tiene un empleo estable o lo perdió o vive del comercio informal </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Que manera tan inteligente de contestarle a la senadora </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Las ciencias de la salud como la medicina, no son exactas como las matemáticas. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Las cifras de contagio y defunciones NO son reales porque se basan en pruebas mínimas que aplica el gobierno. Por lo que es muy arriesgado para la población regresar sin test y pruebas rápidas,  además, es fácil perder el control en "La nueva normalidad". </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Otro loco denle línea y ya </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> hello there friend! wIEo </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> FELICIDADES AL DOCTOR LÓPEZ GATELL APARTE DE GUAPO ES TODO UN CABALLERO. SE NOTA SU EXCELENTE EDUCACIÓN. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Que se haga obligatorio el uso de cubrebocas en el transporte público. La gente no atiende indicaciones, les vale todo y, después ya están lamentándose. Aunado a que arriesgan a los otros. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Creo en usted Dr. Gatell y el Sr. presidente así que me niego a creer lo que menciona la UNAM en un artículo, el cual dice que lo peor de la pandemia está por venir, esperándose para el 27 de junio. </COMMENT 18>

<COMMENT 2> God says: vengeance is mine, I will repay. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> China should be compensating the world for the virus </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Viewers doubt is,,,,
If it is an accident,, 
then why China did not alert the rest of the world. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> When u play as god, this is the ramafacation </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> He is only thinking and why u are making a big fuss abt it let him prove first </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Yup. The amount of bs coming out from China was just shocking. Blaming market etc </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> 👏👏👏💞 </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> You don't need to need to be an MI6 double-nought spy to know what is really going on. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Why isnt anyone talking about this virus having  the back bone of HIV??which shows its man made </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Don't  lie </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> There's nothing accidentally in the CV-19 chaos and confusion, double speech and down right an attack on all life and Liberty.
 This was no accident, this was well planned. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> It's USA fear of investigation from WHO!! That's why they pull out. Use your common sense, I'm not from China, please think! Since USA is paying 450 million to WHO & China only pay 40 millions, why should they cover anything for China? Use your freaking brain with common sense! Please don't try to be stupid if or when you are not!!! </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> To be honest, most biochemical labs should prepare some emergency defending systems to prevent virus leakage from their labs' facilities, generally speaking. But the biochemical lab of the city of China Wuhan didn't have such defending process and the US secretary of Dept state, Mike Pompeo said "They hadn't enough level's preventing system in the lab considering the information of our intelligence agencies" It might have been an accident but the results are so creepy as we know and China became one of the victim countries by their virus. In the first place, they shouldn't have started the experiments. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> People have suspected that from the very beginning. The corrupt, ineffective WHO seems to not want to accept it, because of its relationship with China. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> What about 00 agent </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Its what half the world were saying 5 months ago </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Ex M </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Omg! Still going on about its ftom the Lab? Without proof? Don't forget it had been reported that the virus covid was very first found is in America mid of 2019 where peoples die of flu and they cover it up!! Till USA themselves confirm to the world that they found in actual fact that this patients actually have covid. </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 1> Ok I hope so because it seems like fssa is making it harder to maintain </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> I had my phone interview and the caseworker insisted I have income coming from something. She asked how I live without income to get necessities. She was so angry with me she never said goodbye, just hung up on me. Why are people treating people who need snap like a lower class individuals. Benefits are for people with low income or no income. 
I'm sure being a caseworker is stressful but don't take it out on the people who need help, that's what causes some people to go hungry instead of being judged. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> FSSA needs to allow e-mail communication in the future, but especially now. The FSSA offices are closed, as are the libraries. I was told that I can mail documents in, but so many are also without a printer while the library is closed. Faxes are nearly a thing of the past and FSSA would be wise to update to a faster, easier, and more organized way of submitting documents. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Super grateful for the food stamps. Truly, I am. The only note I can offer FSSA is that, during a redetermination, if you don't get the documents you need, you don't find out until it's too late to do anything and you have to wait to reapply all over again. There is finally a web page that does offer some communication but it's far from clear. Being able to email documents would be very much appreciated as well. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> I applied last week... </COMMENT 5>

We need funds to study the source of the problems. That is the pandemic we have faced for over 400 years. </COMMENT 18>

Conservatives cancel these programs and create a council on breaking down barriers.

<COMMENT 7> Je suis à 1000% athée, pour moi la science est au-dessus de tout, la méthode scientifique et l'étude des biais ça me parle, j'ai depuis des années suivi tous les zététos (c'est comme ça que je les nomme dorénavant) car j'y ai appris beaucoup il faut le reconnaître, enfin j'ai surtout pu comprendre comment aiguiser d'avantage son esprit critique, dans le même temps je rejetais Aberkane (à juste titre pour certaines choses ça il faut le reconnaître aussi, car le neuromachinchouette et les manipulations de cv trop peu pour moi), puis est arrivé cette crise et surtout "l'affaire" Raoult et là j'ai comme reçu un coup de couteau rouillé dans le dos par toute la communauté zététique tellement ils étaient emplis d'une nullité intellectuelle que j'ignorais, ou plutôt que je ne voulais pas m'avouer... 


Ils ont assassiné le mot jugeote et ça m'a profondément déçu, récemment je les ai tous supprimé avec grand regret certes que ce soit sur fb ou youtube mais le mal était fait et c'est irréversible tant pis pour eux.


Et bizarrement alors qu'on était en pleine tempête et que j'étais en train de me battre sur les réseaux avec les méthodistes psycho-rigide qui sont bien trop fort pour moi dans la rhétorique, et bien je suis tombé un peu par hasard (pas vraiment vu le buzz) sur la fameuse vidéo où Idriss disait en introduction _"La corruption académique tue!"_ et depuis je me surprend à n'être que d'accord avec tout ce qu'il dit, c'est assez incroyable comment les événements peuvent changer radicalement les opinions des uns et des autres, et sans me la raconter je suis bien content de faire parti de ces gens-là, ceux ayant encore de la jugeote et un véritable esprit critique ! </COMMENT 7>

Dr. Andrew Kaufman: They Want To Genetically Modify Us With The COVID-19 Vaccine
https://youtu.be/qy5FD0XameI
In this powerful interview Spiro is joined with Doctor Andrew Kaufman. Spiro and Dr. Kaufman discuss the expanding curtailment of basic civil liberties being normalized under the false pretext of a global health emergency.

Doctor Kaufman lays his reputation and his career on the line as he blows the whistle, on what he describes as a manufactured crisis to carry out a preplanned agenda to facilitate global governance and population control.

Doctor Kaufman is a well educated medical professional who convincingly illustrates, using the CDC's own technical data, how the public has been manipulated on the grandest scale. </COMMENT 11>

<COMMENT 17> Bonjour,

Les zététiciens restent simplement rigoureux sur la volonté de ne pas prétendre aléatoirement des choses et de les présenter comme étant vraies lorsque celles-ci n'ont pas été prouvées et lorsqu'il n'y a aucune source vérifiable. Les zeteticiens plus que tous savent que la science avance par l'erreur et la mise en place d'actions correctrices. Chasser la malhonnêteté scientifique renforcera l'efficacité de la méthode. Il y a suffisamment de boue et d'erreurs non volontaires forcément causées par le principe même de la recherche (votre emploi du mot boue est d'ailleurs ridicule, car même si une conclusion est erronée ce n'est pas de la boue, c'est une connaissance. Savoir que telle piste est fausse est une connaissance) pour ne pas que s'y ajoute de malhonnêtes prétentions de pseudo-savoir. Il y a une différence entre résultats négatifs, erreurs et mensonges... Ce sont les mensonges que les zeteticiens chassent. Le fait de vous les être mis à dos de part vos propres actions et comportements mensongers passés ne justifie en rien vos propos ici.

A votre place, il me semble que j'essaierai de tourner la page et d'apprendre de mes erreurs plutôt que de revenir sur un sujet dont vous ne sortez pas grandi et imputable à vos strictes décisions personnelles. J'ai regardé votre vidéo sur l'art contemporain... il y avait beaucoup trop à dire en terme d'erreurs et de propagation d'idées fausses.., je me suis abstenu. Je suis persuadé que vos qualités peuvent être utiles si vous les cadriez et si vous ne débordiez pas hors des sujets que vous maîtrisez pas. Il faudrait également peut être avoir l'humilité d'accepter de ne pas tout savoir, et d'accepter la critique. C'est aussi ainsi qu'avance la science. Je suis persuadé qu'en revoyant votre méthode et votre fonctionnement, vous seriez d'une inestimable valeur pour participer à des réflexions sur certains sujets. Vos revanches personnelles à la rhétorique bancale sont ridicules, c'est vraiment dommage.

Pour reprendre votre analogie, vous ne pouvez pas dire à la fois que la boue on s'en moque puisqu'on va la passer au tamis et dans le même temps accuser la zetetique, de casser la science puisque l'esprit de La zététique n'est ni plus ni moins que celui de votre tamis Monsieur. Et si vous ne passez pas à travers le tamis, ne vous en prenez pas à lui, essayez plutôt de vous dégrossir. Ce message porte sur les propos et les idées que vous avancez ici, non sur votre personne (enfin dans l'intention) </COMMENT 17>

<COMMENT 12> Thank you, Dr. Kim </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> There should be done way these two extremely intelligent physicians can be on main stream tv ! </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> 99% of the people who got covid recovered without the need for any vaccine. 
Do you know what is in those vaccines? Please check. Baby fetuses, aluminum and formalehyde.
Do you think this will help you with your health? </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Please check how the World Health Organisation has made a vaccination campaign in Kenya with an anti-fertility agent in vaccines to sterilise women in 2014.
Please the article on researchgate made by scientist so you can judge by yourself as some articles from some media have tried to say it was a mistake or not true.
They have tried to do the same thing in Mexico, Philippines and Nicaragua in 1994.
I m sure this doctor must know these cases. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Can't believe how he explained so well what is a vaccine and how it works. I understand perfectly. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> The way he tells the information and pronounces it , it's very very clear. Wow </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Dr Kim is very clear, thorough, and calm in answering these great interview questions from Stephen Park, which are always presented as a genuine dialogue rather than a firing off of “Question 1—done, Question 2—done” as often happens in media interviews. These are great interviews. I appreciate your preparedness for these dialogues, Stephen, and your choice of the experts you interview. Great job. Thank you! </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Steve, I love science, but, it makes me sad that the Third phase tests on animals. I wish there was a better way to develop vaccines. Thank you for the informative interview. 💚 </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Please interview Dr Kim again </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 19> Très intéressant, seulement penser que l’oxygénation est la seule fonction du poumon c’est oublier que la decarboxylation et la mobilisation de volumes sont indispensables à la respiration, donc il serait impossible de faire de l’oxygénation seule, il sera nécessaire de continuer la ventilation mécanique pour les patients en syndrome de détresse respiratoire aiguë </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 3> Ah bon ?! </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> En bref, des abrutis plus ou moins alcoolisés ou consommateurs de drogue vont profiter du déconfinement pour faire leur révolution de cas sociaux. Au moment même ou les entreprises souvent au bord de la faillite auront besoin de retrouver en urgence de l'activité, des hordes de bolcheviques et d'anarchistes vont bloquer, casser, brûler, bloquer le pays. Les racailles de banlieues s'en donneront à cœur joie et le jour d'après ? Aucun projet, aucune unité, des recettes fiscales en chute libre, la spirale du chaos. Ce peuple ne mérite que la misère et le moyen age ! </COMMENT 4>

<COMMENT 6> Vous rêvez éveillé! Le confinement est une arme contre les soulèvements populaires, soyez lucide, ce confinement. va continuer perfidement, cela a déjà commencé on nous dit qu’on ne sait pas quant ces confinements vont cesser, résultat la révolte se fera chacun chez soi  à ronger sa rage, mais
chez soi, donc nulle !

<COMMENT 8> A propos de la mortalité, un petit calcul : 7 milliards d'habitants / hypothèse longévité moyenne 70 ans ( pour ne pas se casser la tête ) = 100 millions de décès par an. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> L'article 35 de la Déclaration des droits de l'homme et du citoyen du 24 juin 1793 affirme:
« Quand le gouvernement viole les droits du peuple, l'insurrection est pour le peuple et pour chaque portion du peuple, le plus sacré des droits et le plus indispensable des devoirs ».
Relevant de l'ordre constitutionnel, l'insurrection est ainsi un droit imprescriptible « supérieur aux lois » ; elle permet au peuple de manifester directement sa force et sa puissance plus que son désir de s'opposer aux dérives de l'Etat vers l'arbitraire ou l'injustice manifeste ; elle lui permet d'exprimer pacifiquement (ou violemment, selon l'intensité de la répression qui pourrait lui être opposée par les organes de pouvoir) son refus, son rejet, son objection à toute orientation vers le despotisme et l'autoritarisme. Le droit à l'insurrection signifie clairement que les fondements de la légitimité des pouvoirs publics se sont totalement désorganisés. Il est le « dernier recours » avant la révolution, laquelle peut devenir nécessité si la confusion devient dérèglement et s'inscrit dans l'ordre constitutionnel.
Le droit à l'insurrection a pour titulaire le « peuple », non l'individu ou un groupe d'individus. Il est une « sanction » à l'égard des gouvernements qui ont failli à leurs missions, à leurs taches. </COMMENT 9>

Victoire en vue sur le Covid.
Merci à Corinne Prose pour le partage:

Info transmise par le Whatsapp des professeurs de médecine, médecins et directeurs de clinique du groupe Elsan.
Covid-19 : Une découverte majeure :
Plusieurs équipes dans plusieurs pays (notamment en Chine, en France - à Lille - aux USA), ont fait une découverte majeure qui offre un grand espoir de traitement du covid :
Le virus, en effet, ne tuerait pas directement, mais par l'intermédiaire d'une bactérie intestinale qu'il infecterait, la Prevotella... et c'est cette bactérie infectée qui, devenant virulente, déclencherait l'hyper-réaction immunitaire qui délabre les poumons et tue le malade !
Ceci expliquerait :

Pourquoi le traitement du Dr. Raoult, utilisant un antibiotique (l'Azithromycine), et plus encore celui du Dr Sabine Paliard-Franco, qui préconise une double antibiothérapie, fonctionnent,

Pourquoi les enfants sont épargnés et les personnes âgées plus touchées : Provetella est quasiment absente de la flore intestinale enfantine, mais de plus en plus présente avec l'âge,

Pourquoi les obèses sont beaucoup plus touchés : leur flore intestinale déséquilibrée contient beaucoup de Prevotella !

Pourquoi les complications pulmonaires se déclenchent alors qu'on ne retrouve pratiquement plus de covid dans l'appareil respiratoire, la bactérie infectée (qu'on retrouve dans les selles, contenant de l'ARN du covid et parfois même des virus vivants) prenant le relai de son attaque initiale (bénigne), de manière beaucoup plus dramatique, en déclenchant l'hyper-réaction immunitaire inflammatoire qui noie les poumons...

Pourquoi le virus peut réapparaître chez un patient guéri (avec alternance de positivité et de négativité des tests), car la bactérie, toujours présente dans la flore intestinale, en reste l'hôte et peut le relarguer à tous moments...

Bref, cela expliquerait tout ; et cette cohérence augure de la validité de l'hypothèse.
On tient donc une confirmation de l'intérêt de l'azithromycine, comme thérapeutique curative, à prescrire dès le début de l'infection... et même une piste prometteuse pour traiter préventivement les infections graves (des coronavirus... et sans doute aussi de la grippe !), ce traitement passant par le rétablissement d'une flore intestinale saine qui neutralise Prevotella (par la prescriptions de "probiotiques", c'est à dire d'une bonne flore intestinale)...

Il est clair que cette piste thérapeutique ultra-prometteuse bon-marché rendrait alors caduque l'utilisation d'un vaccin, de découverte aléatoire et onéreuse... ce qui ruinerait donc encore les espoirs lucratifs de Gilead et de ses lobbyistes, après l'échec patent de leurs antiviraux... dont on ne parle plus trop, vu que les premiers essais thérapeutiques (dont plusieurs malades ont payé le prix de leur vie) se sont révélés catastrophiques, tant en terme d'inefficacité que de toxicité...
Il est probable aussi que les médias aux ordres, qui avaient lynché Raoult, parce qu'il laissait entrevoir cette piste thérapeutique bon marché, qui concurrençait leurs antiviraux dont ils attendaient de gros retours financiers, nous taisent cette découverte majeure, et qu'en revanche ils nous serinent maintenant, à temps et à contretemps, que leur vaccin (qui est loin d'être au point et qu'il faudra refaire chaque année, comme celui de la grippe) est la "seule solution" !

C'est vraiment agréable d'entendre des paroles censées sur la situation actuelle et nous expliquer comment les mots faux ont et drainent encore des maux terribles!!

<COMMENT 1> Merci pour vos émissions. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> les auditeurs qui interviennent n ont en général  vraiment aucun propos intéressant </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Ah bon ?! </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> En bref, des abrutis plus ou moins alcoolisés ou consommateurs de drogue vont profiter du déconfinement pour faire leur révolution de cas sociaux. Au moment même ou les entreprises souvent au bord de la faillite auront besoin de retrouver en urgence de l'activité, des hordes de bolcheviques et d'anarchistes vont bloquer, casser, brûler, bloquer le pays. Les racailles de banlieues s'en donneront à cœur joie et le jour d'après ? Aucun projet, aucune unité, des recettes fiscales en chute libre, la spirale du chaos. Ce peuple ne mérite que la misère et le moyen age ! </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> c </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Vous rêvez éveillé! Le confinement est une arme contre les soulèvements populaires, soyez lucide, ce confinement. va continuer perfidement, cela a déjà commencé on nous dit qu’on ne sait pas quant ces confinements vont cesser, résultat la révolte se fera chacun chez soi  à ronger sa rage, mais
chez soi, donc nulle ! 
Imaginez qu’ils suppriment le confinement, vont ils risquer la rage du peuple, donc ils vont faire durer le plaisir, qui vivra verra ! </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> "J'attrapai maffesoli et je lui mettais deux tartes dans la gueule" </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> A propos de la mortalité, un petit calcul : 7 milliards d'habitants / hypothèse longévité moyenne 70 ans ( pour ne pas se casser la tête ) = 100 millions de décès par an. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> L'article 35 de la Déclaration des droits de l'homme et du citoyen du 24 juin 1793 affirme:
« Quand le gouvernement viole les droits du peuple, l'insurrection est pour le peuple et pour chaque portion du peuple, le plus sacré des droits et le plus indispensable des devoirs ».
Relevant de l'ordre constitutionnel, l'insurrection est ainsi un droit imprescriptible « supérieur aux lois » ; elle permet au peuple de manifester directement sa force et sa puissance plus que son désir de s'opposer aux dérives de l'Etat vers l'arbitraire ou l'injustice manifeste ; elle lui permet d'exprimer pacifiquement (ou violemment, selon l'intensité de la répression qui pourrait lui être opposée par les organes de pouvoir) son refus, son rejet, son objection à toute orientation vers le despotisme et l'autoritarisme. Le droit à l'insurrection signifie clairement que les fondements de la légitimité des pouvoirs publics se sont totalement désorganisés. Il est le « dernier recours » avant la révolution, laquelle peut devenir nécessité si la confusion devient dérèglement et s'inscrit dans l'ordre constitutionnel.
Le droit à l'insurrection a pour titulaire le « peuple », non l'individu ou un groupe d'individus. Il est une « sanction » à l'égard des gouvernements qui ont failli à leurs missions, à leurs taches. </COMMENT 9>

Victoire en vue sur le Covid.
Merci à Corinne Prose pour le partage:

Info transmise par le Whatsapp des professeurs de médecine, médecins et directeurs de clinique du groupe Elsan.
Covid-19 : Une découverte majeure :
Plusieurs équipes dans plusieurs pays (notamment en Chine, en France - à Lille - aux USA), ont fait une découverte majeure qui offre un grand espoir de traitement du covid :
Le virus, en effet, ne tuerait pas directement, mais par l'intermédiaire d'une bactérie intestinale qu'il infecterait, la Prevotella... et c'est cette bactérie infectée qui, devenant virulente, déclencherait l'hyper-réaction immunitaire qui délabre les poumons et tue le malade !
Ceci expliquerait :

Pourquoi le traitement du Dr. Raoult, utilisant un antibiotique (l'Azithromycine), et plus encore celui du Dr Sabine Paliard-Franco, qui préconise une double antibiothérapie, fonctionnent,

Pourquoi les enfants sont épargnés et les personnes âgées plus touchées : Provetella est quasiment absente de la flore intestinale enfantine, mais de plus en plus présente avec l'âge,

Pourquoi les obèses sont beaucoup plus touchés : leur flore intestinale déséquilibrée contient beaucoup de Prevotella !

Pourquoi les complications pulmonaires se déclenchent alors qu'on ne retrouve pratiquement plus de covid dans l'appareil respiratoire, la bactérie infectée (qu'on retrouve dans les selles, contenant de l'ARN du covid et parfois même des virus vivants) prenant le relai de son attaque initiale (bénigne), de manière beaucoup plus dramatique, en déclenchant l'hyper-réaction immunitaire inflammatoire qui noie les poumons...

Pourquoi le virus peut réapparaître chez un patient guéri (avec alternance de positivité et de négativité des tests), car la bactérie, toujours présente dans la flore intestinale, en reste l'hôte et peut le relarguer à tous moments...

Bref, cela expliquerait tout ; et cette cohérence augure de la validité de l'hypothèse.
On tient donc une confirmation de l'intérêt de l'azithromycine, comme thérapeutique curative, à prescrire dès le début de l'infection... et même une piste prometteuse pour traiter préventivement les infections graves (des coronavirus... et sans doute aussi de la grippe !), ce traitement passant par le rétablissement d'une flore intestinale saine qui neutralise Prevotella (par la prescriptions de "probiotiques", c'est à dire d'une bonne flore intestinale)...

Il est clair que cette piste thérapeutique ultra-prometteuse bon-marché rendrait alors caduque l'utilisation d'un vaccin, de découverte aléatoire et onéreuse... ce qui ruinerait donc encore les espoirs lucratifs de Gilead et de ses lobbyistes, après l'échec patent de leurs antiviraux... dont on ne parle plus trop, vu que les premiers essais thérapeutiques (dont plusieurs malades ont payé le prix de leur vie) se sont révélés catastrophiques, tant en terme d'inefficacité que de toxicité...
Il est probable aussi que les médias aux ordres, qui avaient lynché Raoult, parce qu'il laissait entrevoir cette piste thérapeutique bon marché, qui concurrençait leurs antiviraux dont ils attendaient de gros retours financiers, nous taisent cette découverte majeure, et qu'en revanche ils nous serinent maintenant, à temps et à contretemps, que leur vaccin (qui est loin d'être au point et qu'il faudra refaire chaque année, comme celui de la grippe) est la "seule solution" !

<COMMENT 14> Excellente analyse de Michel Maffesoli. C'est vraiment agréable d'entendre des paroles censées sur la situation actuelle et nous expliquer comment les mots faux ont et drainent encore des maux terribles!!  Sa vision d'une nouvelle génération à venir basée sur l'essentiel donne une véritable bouffée d'oxygène,  d'espoir et c'est indispensable pour construire une nouvelle base pour notre avenir. Merci encore pour cette très belle intervention et je souligne votre sens de partage de votre culture avec beaucoup humilité. Je vais me plonger dans vos livres avec impatience !! Tout mon respect. Cordialement. </COMMENT 14>

<COMMENT 2> Ultra Long-Winded! </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> the best type of protection lol  did you forget about p100 and p3 ? </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> The solution is at nutrimedical dot com first line of defence kit. </COMMENT 4>

<COMMENT 6> You'd think they would have done a fabric lifespan test right from the start. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> I've been letting my KN95 masks hang on a hanger in my hot somewhat dry garage for 3 days to decontaminate after use. I hope that works! I use them for when I go into Walmart or 7-11. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Beautifully spoke everything. Better than all the other videos showing the same thing </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> People in the United States need to realize that surgical or cloth face masks will not keep you safe from contracting Covid19. There is a huge reason why so many people were still getting sick during the stay at home orders. They were not wearing the proper ppe to keep them safe. I also just made an amazing video which teaches you everything you need to know about spotting fake or counterfeit KN95 face masks </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> I know its not the right way in a professional medical setting but for the general public who want to reuse their surgical style masks, I found that this is a good way to do it. Starting with clean hands of course...
1. Fill clean sink with hot water
2. Get the mask wet in the water
3. Use a plain bar of soap on your hands to get them soapy
4. Gently scrub mask in between hands making sure to get in the creases. Do this for a couple minutes.
5. rinse in the hot water
6. fold width wise and squeeze out excess water
7. hang somewhere clean to dry
8. when dry use a new ziploc bag to store in until use. only use bag once </COMMENT 10>

<COMMENT 13> You guys can buy N-95 masks from this link

Directly from amazon.
Thanks me later :) </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> my box of N95 masks was my biggest flex of april </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Is sanitizing a FFP2 or FFP3 mask with an UV + ozone box effective and safe to use? For example the following product -> UV Sterilizer Box Ozone Automatic Disinfection Box: https://a.aliexpress.com/_dYKjmlZ </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> You also have this store with reusable masks. They are washable and have been certified for 10 washes. They come in packs of 10 masks.
https://eesocial.org/en/masks/reusable-masks/58/ </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> 3M should be able to invent a updated N95 mask that can be cleaned  multiples of times without degrading the fit or the filtering material. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> https://costamedic.com/n95_face_mask/ </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Please educate yourself with the following facts :

1.Viruses are not contagious, as proven in 1918, in the only known major test in history, conducted by the US health service in Boston, following what was incorrectly referred to as the Spanish Flu, (caused by WW1 vaccines) that tested the contagiousness of alleged viruses. Contagiousness was not able to be demonstrated, in 300 independent tests when specifically attempting to prove so. There is no empirical scientific evidence what-so-ever, ever-provided for the contagiousness of viruses, the disease-causing capabilities of viruses or the existence of COVID-19 as an alleged contagious disease. There is no evidence for the existence of COVID-19 as an alleged new disease or any proof of it's alleged connection to what is known as Coronavirus. The total number of worldwide deaths from all causes of death is less this year than previous years, therefore there can be no pandemic.  

2. No medically relevant virus has ever been purified or isolated, as per Kock's postulates, (the scientific criteria designed by the father of modern micro-biology Robert Koch, to establish the causal relationship between an alleged micro-organism or pathogen, and an alleged disease. Noted Virologist & micro-biologist Dr Stefan Lanka offered a prize of €100,000 for evidence to prove the existence of any isolated virus, specifically the alleged measles virus, and to prove a virus being allegedly contagious and/or disease-causing. The German Supreme court ruled, after he was challenged, that no such evidence was provided. The reward remains unclaimed ever since 2016 and the existence of viruses as alleged contagious pathogens, remains unproven, as does germ-theory itself, on which this ludicrous proofless assumption is founded.  

3. When we exhale, we breath out toxins that the body needs to expel. Wearing a mask means you are not only breathing these toxins and poisonous carbon-dioxide back in, which will create an immune response known as a "virus" to expel these toxins, but masks also prevent the body from receiving the correct amount of fresh air that it needs in order to function correctly & remain healthy, resulting in chronically stressing the body, making a person's health considerably weaker and prone to disease, since the lack of oxygen also creates many other health problems, specifically hypoxia, which causes Cancer as well as the possibility of falling over dead due to lack of oxygen to the brain & heart, as occurred recently in China, when two boys suddenly dropped dead due to being forced to exercise while wearing face-masks.

4. Wearing masks is only a sign of total ignorance and obedient compliance to unnecessary pointless measures enforced by a police-state fascist communist dictatorship of totalitarian total control and enslavement of humanity, as well as a violation of humanitarian rights, and enforcing the clueless to wear health-destroying masks only confirms that the equally clueless are supporting this same police-state fascist communist dictatorship of totalitarian total control and enslavement of humanity, as well as enforcing & creating the ill-health of all who are decived to do so through fear, which will induce exosmomes in the body which will show up as testing positive in the COVID test, which tests for genetic sequence markers from exosomes, since thee test cannot test for a virus which cannoot be proven to exist!

5. The micron-pore size of an N95 mask, that so many sheeple are wearing.. is 1/MILLIONTH of a meter.. whereas the alleged "virus" (if it existed as a contagious "agent".. which it doesn't) would be on a scale of 1/BILLIONTH of a meter.. which would be like a 6000 foot tall, 6000 foot wide door, trying to prevent a 6 foot tall person from passing through the door.. there would be no problem passing through the door.. They are as pointlessly unnecessary as social-distancing. Face masks only limit your consumption of oxygen(air) even further. Add that to 5G at 60ghz frequency, (the absorption frequency of oxygen) which is being "essentially" rolled out everywhere,  that can disrupt the attachment of oxygen molecules to hemoglobin and you will have hypoxia even faster. (Oxygen deprivation) which will ultimately look like respiratory disorders and be labeled COVID-19!

6. Otto Warburg won the Nobel Prize for medicine in 1931 for discovering that Cancer was caused as a direct result of lack of oxygen in the body.

7. President Trump's COVID-19 task force "expert" "Dr" Fauci as well as the surgeon general and many other medical doctors,  have all already stated that masks are totally ineffective, unnecessary and pointless, and should NOT be worn by anyone.  Awakened critical-thinkers will not be wanting to damage their health by wearing such human-rights violating, oxygen-depriving, toxin-respiring, bacteria-collecting, health-damaging, masks, which only consent to their own enslavement in a totalitarian fascist police-state tyrannical dictatorship of control. 

8.  If easily-deceived sheeple want to destroy their own health by wearing pointless, unnecessary ineffective health-damaging face-masks, why do they believe that their face-masks will not be thought to be effective for them, unless everyone else also destroys their health by wearing one too? What is the point of wearing a mask if it does not work unless others are forced to wear them too?!

9. Please provide the following , so as to prove the necessity for these ludicrous new measures :

1). Provide empirical proof an electron micrograph of the pure and fully characterized alleged COVID-19 "Virus", or indeed any other alleged medically relevant virus, and claim the €100,000 prize from Dr Stefan Lanka.

2. What is the name of the primary specialist peer-reviewed paper in which the alleged COVID-19 "virus" is shown isolated, photographed, illustrated and its full genetic information described.

3. What is the name of the primary publication, that provides which empirical proof, that a particular "virus"  is the sole cause of a particular disease,  so as to satisfy Koch's postulates.

4. Provide empirical (demonstrably observable & repeatably testable) evidence to prove the contagiousness of COVID-19 or any other alleged virus, so as to satisfy Koch's postulates.

4. Provide empirical proof that an alleged "virus" which is claimed to be neither living nor dead, is a naturally-possible state of existence.

5. Provide empirical proof that inert, non-living matter, (without the ability to eat, excrete, reproduce, or has its own independent DNA, can be scientifically proven to be an infectious agent able to reproduce, and infect another organisms to cause disease via alleged contagion, so as to satisfy Koch's postulates.

Biologst Lynn Margulis : "Viruses" are no more germs or enemies, than are bacteria or human cells", all of which need to be present in the body in order for life to be possible. Bacteria are the body's vitally necessary garbage disposal mechanism, that are ever-present in all life, especially necessary when illness is present. They are no more the cause of disease, as Firemen are the cause of fires, just because Firemen are present dealing with fires.

Is this the health-damaging nonsense that you are wanting to support and be associated with? Do you realize the health implications & consequences that you will be directly responsible for to millions of previously health people, by supporting & enforcing the wearing of health-destroying face-masks?!!! 

 
Please wake up to reality before it's too late.. I await the proofs requested above.

<TITLE> Covid-19 pandemic: WHO restart hydroxychloroquine tests after study doubts </TITLE>

<COMMENT 1> Are we killing more people for no good reason? Why? :-) </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> No wonder India gave HCQ to Trump when he asked lol. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> The WHO cannot but prove their incompetence each and every day...they're irrelevant. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> The reputation of the W.H.O. and the Lancet is in tatters. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> No zinc, no point. It's a zinc ionophore. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Indian Council for Medical Research ICMR has time & again said that HCQ has proved itself to be effective as a post exposure preventive medicine & ICMR has expanded the use of HCQ by Frontline health care workers in India. 
WHO is under mmense pressure from big pharmaceutical companies to discard as it's cheap as compared to other antiviral drugs. WHO is corrupt from top to bottom. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> REGARDLESS OF YOUR STUDY,  Freedom to practice medicine is paramount to the TYRANNY of unelected officials telling a people what they may do or not do when seeking to remedy their own Health. SHAME ON YOU whom deny others the FREEDOM. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Can you believe this,our well being rides on their relationship  at the time. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Ethier way Trumps been taking it. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> So it still might work </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> OMG globalists you've being lying!
What else you've been lying about? </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Trust Tedros? WHO really cares! I would rather jump off a cliff than take HCQ. Long live Communism!!! TRUMP 2020 </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> In other words; corrupt, unelected, CCP-backed organization that’s been wrong about virtually everything regarding the virus, tries what specialists in the USA have suggested for months so that they can take credit.

K, thanks. </COMMENT 13>

CÔ-RÔ-NA-VŨ-HÁN

Cô-Rô-Vũ-Hán xổng chuồng
Gây nên dịch bệnh luông tuồng hiểm nguy
Trung-Nam-Hải ém nhẹm đi
Người dân Tàu Cộng chết vì… lây lan
Quạ đen muỗi độc kêu khan
Bầu trời u ám… Hán gian tung hoành
Cô-Vít 19 xuân xanh
Vượt ranh Vũ Hán lộng hành khắp nơi
Gây nên đại dịch cho người
Cách ly, phong tỏa… đáng đời Hán gian
Trung Hoa lục địa bế quan
Chia năm sẻ bảy… suy tàn đến nơi

HẾT BẢY CÒN BA

Ngồi buồn xem chuyện Cô Vi
Mới hơn trăm bữa Cô đi toàn cầu 
Nghe tên trên nét cũng rầu
Bởi đang nổi tiếng năm Châu vang rền
Từ “Hãn Vú” Cô bò lên
Trẻ già bé nhớn Cô “khền” chẳng tha 
Từ người Cô hoá thành ma
Đưa vô lò sấy í a vi trần 
Tàng hình cố giấu đôi chân
Cô bay lơ lửng ghé gần sân bay
Chỉ cần tay chạm… tóc mai
Hương gây mùi nhớ, men cay hít vào
Cô Vi hớn hở đến chào
Bao nhiêu nan phổi ôi chao chứa đầy
Cô cười má đỏ hây hây 
Tha hồ bày tiệc phen nầy no nê
Cách ly, ngăn chặn trò hề 
Thênh thang cất bước theo mê lộ dài
Mask che, đeo kiếng... mặc ai 
Cô Vi đỏng đảnh trổ tài đó nha 
Mười phần hết bảy còn ba

HẬN TÀU CỘNG  

Tim lòng quặn thắt từng cơn
Lòng dâng lên nỗi căm hờn Tàu Hoa
Bao người rưng lệ xót xa
Vì đâu thế giới chan hòa sầu thương
Năm châu,bốn bể đoạn trường
Bầm gan tím ruột giận phường lưu manh
Để cho Cô-Vít hoành hành
Tràn lan khắp chốn và tanh xác người
Cận Bình họ Tập kia ơi,
Sao mà ác quá ông trời chẳng dung
Biển Đông sóng dậy đùng đùng
Đông Nam Châu Á cùng chung số phần
Thiên Công chỉ điểm mấy lần
Bao nhiêu bịnh lạ dần dần xảy ra
Ngày sau tụi nó thành ma
Luật trời vay trả âu là chí công!

WHO is under mmense pressure from big pharmaceutical companies to discard as it's cheap as compared to other antiviral drugs. WHO is corrupt from top to bottom. </COMMENT 6>

<COMMENT 8> Can you believe this,our well being rides on their relationship  at the time. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Ethier way Trumps been taking it. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> So it still might work </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> OMG globalists you've being lying!
What else you've been lying about? </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Trust Tedros? WHO really cares! I would rather jump off a cliff than take HCQ. Long live Communism!!! TRUMP 2020 </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> In other words; corrupt, unelected, CCP-backed organization that’s been wrong about virtually everything regarding the virus, tries what specialists in the USA have suggested for months so that they can take credit.

<COMMENT 9> 1 Phút sẽ cứu được ai đó hết nợ nần

Đôi lời chia sẻ tới mọi người mình là một người chơi lô đề và khi mình chơi thua lỗ bể nợ lên tới hơn 150 triệu , cuộc sống lúc đó đúng là đến tệ tới mức người gia đình còn xa lánh , mất hết niềm tin của anh em bạn bè. Cuộc sống thật dự bế tắc
Trước mình cũng mua số rất nhiều nơi phí trước.phí sau .miễn phí có cả .nhưng tiền mất tật mang mà chính như thế mình mới mang nợ nhiều. Hoang mang
, may sao lướt facebook  có quen đươc1 bạn và giới thiệu qua Bên Zalo Anh Nhật ____ 0854081234
 Hôm đầu tiên theo mình cũng sợ nên mình chỉ dám lấy lô mình ăn được 3 hôm lô liên tiếp thì mình có vốn và đủ sự tin tưởng thì mình lấy Đề ai ngờ trúng  cả   Đề .thì thực sự mình biết đây chính là ân nhân của mình rồi￼, qua đây anh chị em ai lâm vào hoàn cảnh như mình thì liên hệ với bác ấy xem mà cố gắng. Mình nói bằng chính facebook thật của mình hơn 2.000 bàn bè và tâm sự bằng chính những gì mình trải qua. Mong cho những ai nợ nần thì sớm hết nợ￼.hiểu rõ hơn ai hết￼ cảnh mang nợ
Chúc cho cả nhà một ngày mới tốt lành </COMMENT 9>

<COMMENT 4> Lần trước, tàu Liêu Ninh và 5 tàu hộ tống hôm 12.4 đã đi ngang eo biển Miyako ở phía nam Nhật Bản và phía đông Đài Loan, trước khi hướng về Biển Đông để tổ chức cuộc tập trận mà theo giới quan sát là nhằm gửi thông điệp cho Mỹ.
Trong buổi họp báo tại Bộ Ngoại giao Mỹ ngày 22.4, Ngoại trưởng Mike Pompeo tiếp tục cáo buộc Trung Quốc đang lợi dụng lúc thế giới tập trung ứng phó đại dịch Covid-19 để thực hiện "hành vi khiêu khích" nhằm gây áp lực đối với Hồng Kông, Đài Loan và bắt nạt các nước láng giềng ở Biển Đông, theo Reuters </COMMENT 4>

<COMMENT 2> el bueno es el significado epidemiologico. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> pues que irresponsabilidad de no manejar los datos a tiempo, eso no ayuda a establecer estrategias DR gatell, reporte las que son realmente por dia </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Es absurdo que el gobierno del estado de méxico nos exija cuidados sanitarios y no nos proporcione el agua para poder hacerlo. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> A la opinión pública :
Cómo se posible que a estas alturas y con una emergencia sanitaria tan grave el Secretario de Educación Esteban Moctezuma pretenda reanudar las clases y sin tomar en cuenta la vida y la salud ,
de millones de personas .
No se ustedes pero a través de este medio debemos hacerle saber a este señor que la mayoría no estamos dispuestos a que se atente de esta manera contra la salud tanto de alumnos con del personal que labora en esta dependencia. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Hola todo esta muy bien pero hay algo muy importante y que no se puede dejar a un lado y es la forma tan el IMSS el ISSSTE de la manera mas fraudulenta hace contratos por un mes,a personal médico y de enfermería cuando saben de su trabajo es de alto riesgo.
Señores no creen que nuevamente  están cayendo en actos de corrupción? </COMMENT 6>

<COMMENT 2> Dựa vào tình đại dịch Covid 19 xảy ra hiện nay, thì từ nay đến đầu năm 2021 cả thế giới có thể bị mắc đại dịch này lên đến 10 triệu người là hoàn toàn có thật. Cần phải có sự phòng chống đại dịch này mạnh mẽ và triệt để hơn để hạ thấp số lượng mắc dịch bệnh và hạn chế tử vong, và các tác hại của nó. Thật ra đến nay các biện pháp có hiệu quả tương đối và tạm thời trong phòng chống đại dịch này đã có rồi. Điều quan trọng là các nước, các khu vực, các cộng đồng có thực hiện triệt để không? Đó là giãn cách xã hội, dự phòng cá nhân như là: mang khẩu trang khi ra ngoài, rửa tay thường xuyên với xà phòng và nước, hạn chế tiếp xúc với người bệnh covid 19 và người có triệu chứng bệnh hô hấp, không ra ngoài, không đến chổ đông người, giữ khoảng cách > 2 m với người khác. Cần thực hiện các biện pháp này cho đến khi có vắc xin hay thuốc điều trị có hiệu quả. Các nhà dịch tể học Hoa Kỳ và thế giới đã tiên đoán là dịch bệnh này này chỉ có thể dừng lan truyền khi 60-70 % dân số hoặc khi dự phòng bằng vắc xin. </COMMENT 2>

<COMMENT 11> Suy diễn đơn giản như vầy: thế giới có nhiều quốc gia, mỗi QG có nhiều chợ động vật hoang dã, k fai mới hình thành chợ đv này mới đây mà đã có hàng nghìn năm trc rồi. Nhưng tại sao ở tất cả các chợ đv khác k hình thành virut loại này mà chỉ có ở duy nhất tại Vũ Hán. Nếu loại vr này do tự nhiên mà hình thành thì có thể hình thành ở tất cả các nước trên toàn tg nơi nào có chợ bán nhiều dơi rồi. Ở Indonesia có món dơi truyền thống, chợ đv bán dơi của Indo lớn hơn chợ ở Vũ hán cả chục lần nhưng sao Indo k bùng phát đầu tiên đi. Đã vậy TQ còn bất chấp mọi thủ đoạn để ngăn chặn k cho thế giới tiếp cận để nghiên cứu. Vậy đã hiểu chắc chắn 100% vr này do 1 trung tâm vr tại Vũ Hán tạo ra rồi đỗ lên đầu cái chợ động vật tội nghiệp kia. </COMMENT 11>
