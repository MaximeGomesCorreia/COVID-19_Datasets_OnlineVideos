<COMMENT 3> Oh shut up with this nonsense,  nobody is buying it.  Fake news! </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Not concerned would rather die than to be a slave to you all </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Close the u·¥â û…în…ü country down. Respiratory viruses are nothing to play with. Covid causes permanent heart and lung damage. Thats what we know so far. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> What did you expect? People were reacting to the decline in new cases like the pandemic was over. You saw them on TV marching in protests, riots, going to political rallies, no masks, no gloves, no social distancing, probably didn't even wash their hands when they got home. Others just got tired of being cooped up and decided to take a chance. The only good news out of this is that it will cull out some of the stupidest people in America. 

Hey fake news networks, why didn't you spread the alarm loud, clear, and often that the pandemic wasn't over and the risks were as great as ever. New mutations are more contagious than prior versions and there are more infected people around to spread them. If there are 10 cases undiagnosed for every one that was then there are 30 million infected people in the US, about 1 out of 11. And you still have people so foolish that they are ignoring the simple precautions it takes to stay safe. Well fake news, now that you've deceived people about the truth of the politics and criminals in government you support and try to shield you're killing your audience. Aren't you proud of yourselves? If they all die off who will be left to buy your advertisers' products? </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> More testing = More cases.      Very very very simple concept.    No testing = No cases </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Is anyone else bewildered? I can't digest the cost of human suffering. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> BLM, Spreading lawfulness, thuggery and disease! Wake up America we‚Äôre at war with a terrorist group spreading biological warfare, they are BLM and they are modern terrorists! Don‚Äôt be confused, get out and vote! Obiden wins we all lose... </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> In before  bReAkInG nEwS UsA nEw ReCOrD 600 MiLlIoN CaSeS How did so many cases come about? Well it seems like everyone has this thing called DoUbLe CoRoNa ViRuS. 
After the election happens, we just found a way to stop the corona virus and or create a vaccine! *Completely ignores every single medical professional talking about how it takes a minimum at the very least 10-15 years to even formulate a vaccine this is including the information you have on previous viruses that happened. Much less test it and not only produce it and spread it to a large scale population would take 20-30 years minimum. But don't worry we did it in just a couple of months so incredible!
Just a clarification if your life goes back to normal in 2021. A minimum of 50% of everything you heard including statistics were completely false. I didn't click on this video to watch it I clicked on this video to point out everything this government propaganda pumping sites are doing to your brain. Don't you forget how long it takes to formulate a vaccine from stage one at the quickest on a large scale. If you are watching this video for actual information you should not be allowed to use an electronic device for the safety of yourself and others you might spread this verbal vomit to. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Let it run its course I am High risk" and have lived a good life 99% survive </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> When they say 40,000 new cases, what do they mean?  Are these just people who have tested positive?  Or people admitted to hospitals? </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> 70 percent of the population needs to contract covid,  from the CDC. That's a lot. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> np.. time to go protest like morons some more </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Freedom fighters, but not willing to fight for it. Wear your mask or I can find ways to make you. YouTube isn't a venue to spew nonsense bunker bitches. Nobody cares what you think. Time's up, new leadership is in order. We will have 200,000 deaths due to a lack of leadership and a "freedom fighter" mentality from RED states. Poor decisions all around. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Fake news don't believe </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> How do they get these poll numbers? </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Magical thinking Team Trump meets reality. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> It was caused by people doing normal fun things according to the media. But if they are rioting and protesting it has no effect. The media is all about fear not science. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Less people are dying that‚Äôs the real news more people are testing is why there‚Äôs new numbers and add the rioters to that </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 3> I hope all these stupid pregnant bitches all have miscarriages, and die üòÇüòÇ </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> false positive on 3 different babies?  nope   the issue is clearly a false negative PCR test on an infected pregnant woman.
 occam's razor much?   i thought "this was her wheelhouse"? </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Just another "nothing story" to scare women. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> The woman in pink standing in the aisle isn‚Äôt even pregnant </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> So is this just trying to control people and make them scared to have a baby? </COMMENT 7>

<COMMENT 9> DEPOPULATION; AGENDA 21; UNITED NATIONS; VACCINES; BILL GATES. How did people get this stupid????? </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> The more I learn about the tests we're using for covid-19 the more unreliable I think they might be. </COMMENT 10>

<COMMENT 12> Oh man. My wife is 20 weeks pregnant </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Fear-merchants in full effect! </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> So this big medical organization is urging the federal government, presumably to REQUIRE that pharma companies, to include pregnant women in vaccine trials. 
We all know this isn't going to happen. They probably won't even ask those companies to test all the covid-19 vaccines using the standard scientific method of double-blind placebo testing.
ABC network, can you stand by the health and safety of the American people and follow this, and report on all the methods used to test these vaccines, and report that in your news, and morning programs? I urge you to have our backs on that, as it is vital for public safety. </COMMENT 14>

Wtf just admit we don‚Äôt know nothing and still learning how 3 triplets have false positives how can you think it is more likely for 3 false positives than a false negative commen sense goes out the window when educated people hear information from someone not perceived as educated. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> In other words again the "experts " have absolutely zero clue. But wear your mask or you're a racist asshole.  Thanks Fauchi for fucking this country right in the ass. </COMMENT 17>

He is more worry about being re-elected than people are dying every day due to virus. If he is the captain of the ship, when the ship hit iceberg and sinking, guess who will be the first
one who will take life-boat first and abandon the ship. I am sure he does not even bother to announce it that when the ship is sinking.Now the question is whether USA will have the most dead on this virus among others countries,¬† it is a race against time but time is running out. With fail leadership, still worry about his re-elected & economics more than people 's life.
You have a clown saying 100 000 people died better than 2 Million people dead. First , why not only 100 people or no people dead instead of 100 000 people died? because of his late taking actions not to mention his stupidity, ignorance & dumb,¬† time-costing denial of the threat, a subsequent sluggish response, and a lack of efficient management. "We have done a remarkable job here:¬† we have a lot¬† of body bags, so many beautiful & prefect body bags.¬† Anybody who wants a body bag can get a body bag now at anytime.‚Äù
If you voted for him a few years ago, I hope you and your families and your love one are safe and not infected by the virus and effected by the virus. If yes, nobody is going to feel sorry for you and please welcome to voted for him again for another 4 years to run your run country. We need a lot of people like "YOU"¬† to vote to make the country so call "GREAT" again. I hope next time you will be so lucky again if another new virus strikes again.

Don't you think this has nothing to do with you. Blood is on all of your hands too! Might God show mercy on all of your soul! And he wants to be a cheerleader during this difficult time while hundred of people are dying every single day single mhour single minutes.
People, families 's life are shatter because if his failure. People are paying a big price in life because if his failure in leadership and bear no responsibility. Please go ahead and re-elect him again for year 2020 and run for 4 more years while you, your families and your love one still alive now and let 's hope the next more terror pandemic strikes again during his term to wipe out¬† your souls and all of your love one souls too! what a surprise that this big liar clown did not say those people who died because of virus were hoax and they died of some sort of¬† other health conditions? Americans pay a big huge price for his freaking leadership failure, 
failure to repsonded, failure to mobile all the necessary medical equipment, Personal protection equipment, and testing who have virus, quarantine and contain it.¬† Those people who wish to choose 6 feet under instead of 6 feet apart. please go ahead. you better bring "those" to go to¬† hospital ICU to see those on the ventilation machine equipment till last breath. They don't treasure their own life and love one. A abdicated responsibility leadership.How worst can it get?

<COMMENT 9> It's great that you point out the idiots attending these mask rallies but why doesn't anyone mention the fact that there have been protests for the past month and a half by the thousands. What they are protesting shouldn't matter the fact is those large groups that congregated for weeks are part of the blame too. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> If you listened to everyone telling you this was going to be a huge problem maybe we would not be in the sinking boat we are all in due to your ignorance! We are not listening to your asinine suggestions any longer Rump! You have never been in front of this, "Making America Great" the death toll as of this morning 126,839. My wife is Thai they are next to China, they have a King that cares, death toll there 57. Now you tell me he is in front of this? btw Thailand has been taking this very seriously they were on total lockdown and have already been receiving money from the government free electricity, water, and their mortgages are being taken care of. I have always thought I was living in the greatest country on earth! When this blows over, I'm moving to Thailand I can not stand where our country is going! have you received any assistance? me neither!

<COMMENT 13> BS </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Susan Bassi MASKS HAVE NEVER BEEN WORN CONTINUOUSLY AS THEY ARE NOW BEING MANDATED EVEN IN THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY! You do not hear from us bc MSM/BIG TECH is corrupt and suppresses our voices!! Many are now, and have been condemning this insanity. Only the N95 equipped with respirator valve is made to be worn for extended periods and even THEY have studies literally proving they are even harmful at 8 hour regular use. Pretty much none of the masks being worn are N95 now are they? Medical personnel cannot even change their masks per medical standards bc of shortages as it is, placing them and their patients at higher risk of infection. Do you just not understand how you AIRWAY WORKS?? It doesn‚Äôt take a degree to grasp this simple SURVIVAL process necessary to LIFE and maintenance of health. I have an RN degree, so let me break it down for you. You must breathe in adequate amounts of 02 and blow off adequate amounts of C02. C02 is TOXIC is excess. Excess C02 = imbalanced PH= weakened immunity and/or sickness. No matter how seemingly slight and unnoticeable, masks being worn continuously for extended periods on a regular basis STRAINS and compromises this breathing process. Over time it will make healthy ppl sick, sick ppl sicker, and EVERYONE more susceptible to illness and death, esp during a high stress time where increased cortisol is already weakening immunity. Furthermore, they are not significantly effective at decreasing spread of infection being worn all day long, and actually are dramatically increasing risk of infection of EVERYONE. Most all medical staff are wearing a single mask all day long which they ARE AND WILL, continuously touch to adjust, or to pull it down to BREATHE, no matter how many times gloves are changed. They are gathering beds for not only CV, but also Ecoli, CDif, MRSA, Flu, etc. now being spread everywhere the wearer goes as they constantly touch it and touch everything in their environment from patients to surfaces. This is so unsanitary and unhygienic. Many nurses have chaffed or broken skin now in mask area, greatly increasing their risk of infection from the germ bed covering their AIRWAY as well. The WHO has also stated healthy ppl should NOT be wearing masks this way, and that masks should only be worn when in direct contact with infectious ppl. Dr Fauci has even stated masks are ineffective for healthy ppl in general society, and even harmful being worn this way. Anyone with an IQ above burnt toast should be able to grasp why that is.

Furthermore, social distancing is BLOCKING HERD IMMUNITY!! These corrupt ‚Äúauthorities‚Äù are NOT looking out for your health AT ALL!! This is all FRAUDULENT and against medical advice!!!! Why are they doing this for a strain of corona similar to what we see every year with a ONE % CFR(DR FAUCI-New England Journal of Medicine, March 26), with a 97-99% recovery rate, of which 80% of infected cases are ASYMPTOMATIC and never even know they have it?! Tyranny is why!!!

PCR IS NOT DIAGNOSTIC EITHER. This RESEARCH TOOL is not a diagnostic test as it is being used. The creator, Nobel prize winner Kary Mullis, clearly stated it should NOT be used to confirm infectious disease. The ‚Äútest‚Äù details nd description explains this and why. PCR only detects and amplifies genetic material arising from viral response, NOT any specific virus. The ‚Äútest‚Äù can result positive from other strains of SARS-COV and even if you‚Äôve had a flu shot. Using a PCR test to detect any specific virus is like trying to catch water with a strainer. Fun fact- OJ won his case in part bc PCR used for DNA was PROVED UNRELIABLE IN A COURT OF LAWüòÅ This is all fraudulent on every level it exists and AMA. All statistics arising from trash tests are equally trash. We 
call this JUNK SCIENCE. Cheers. I do like your work, but do not like watching ppl slowly suffocate themselves.STOP WEARING MASKS FOR EXTENDED PERIODS. These corrupt ‚Äúauthorities‚Äù want MORE SICK PPL they can ‚Äúdiagnose‚Äù with their TRASH ‚ÄúTEST‚Äù https://youtu.be/3hGJ2D7Rqc8

<COMMENT 10> if you think that taken Trump out of office is going to help America you are sorely mistaken if the Democrats get in I promise you and I don't care what you all think I promise you that things are going to be bad for the United States of America at least give four more years till we get better Democratic party people and those who are not against the United States of America if you put in a Democratic party you will see the downfall of the United States in the world in 2021-2022 and I promise you this you will be sorry so it's death and ugly for your family, or four more years of Trump, you decide.in the name of God choose wisely because the United States will fall with a democratic government. </COMMENT 10>

<COMMENT 12> Our religious extremists will have their apocalypse regardless of who likes it. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> So wait opening the beaches didn't help? </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Protests / riots dwindling so covid can take the lead again
45 out of 50 Governors did 'NOT' force covid infected patients into Nursing Homes. 
BUT '5' DID: CUOMO NY, WOLF PA, WHITMER MI, MURPHY NJ, NEWSOM CA. 
Nearly half of all Nursing Home deaths were in the five States. That is not a accident! That's Systemic Murder! 
This is the first time in my lifetime the general flu took a year off giving lead to covid to aid Democrats in Mail In Voter Fraud. Weeks of mobs packed together like sardines protesting, rioting, looting, maiming, killing Black, White, Asian, Mexican and any other nationality who tried to protect their businesses from the destruction with Democrats telling us how important it was to get out their and join the violent mob. MSM had a obligation to report the facts: George Floyd and Chauvin worked together as security guards for a night club. It was not a cop randomly killing a Black man, it was personal! When the real investigation is finished, I'm sure we'll be hearing a whole lot more about Floyd and the counterfeit money! 
Suddenly cobra covid raises it's ugly head in every State President Trump has a rally planned. Now Covid is lighting up the country again in order to aid Democrats need to keep Biden stuffed in his basement and out of Debates. Soon Swamp News will start pushing the Democrat agenda to put Americans back under 'house arrest' for the second time as they're now initiating more fear porn to aid and abet Democrat Mail-In Voter Fraud. Will America surrender to the Every Four Year false flag event for Democrats? Not this time! This election will be for law and order, justice for Americans, rebuilding after the destruction, rebuilding our economy and holding Local, State and Federal Swamps responsible for the carnage they've created! Democrats have shown their alignment to anarchist destruction of America at our very foundation, MSM has shown their alignment to anarchist destruction of our country. AG Barr will not be impeached, the indictments will be served to traitors of acts of treason and seditious conspiracy as America repairs the damage! </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Anyone else want to believe trumps lies 
Anyone else want to follow his advise ? 
No open hospital beds in all of Texas </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> just do as trump suggested and test less ,  in fact take it one step further and stop testing altogether  then there will be zero cases #NOTESTSEQUALSNOCASES  #WINNINGBIGLY  #AREWEGREATYET </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> He should blame himself </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> 5g towers dials are turned up. Time to build the fear and keep everyone guessing why everyone is getting sick? But at least everyone will have faster internet! </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Cant breathe with that fucking mask on </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 1> 00:49 - In what ways will the second wave be different to the first wave?
01:44 - Assuming a second wave happens, what is the likelihood that people will comply with another lockdown? 
02:37 - Can we expect further waves until we reach herd immunity?

06:11 - What happens if another virus comes up before we find a vaccine for covid-19?
06:53 - Will the stockmarket decline again with the second wave?
07:47 - What do you think are the positive effects of the pandemic?
09:07 - Can countries afford another long-term lockdown? </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Is the first wave over? </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> There wasn't a first wave </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> I can see the second wave just by seeing their faces.Its so obvious. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> China knew about the virus 6 months ago...they just chose to hide it from the world </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Hahahha this soooo doesn't apply to us in the US üòÇüò≠ </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> "the global lockdown is the single bigggest experiment in the history" they just told you the truth </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> There will be not a second wave. This is such a nonsense. The only way with this kind of video's is to make people more scared than they already were.  The best proof is the beginning of 2000. The world would be destroyed by a computer error. This is what some conspiracy theory thinkers told us by selling their books to make a lot of money with it. This nowadays is exactly the same as than. Now they do it via Youtube by spreading wrong information. </COMMENT 8>

<COMMENT 12> What do you need to about the second wave?

It is the continuation of the most successful psychological operation in human history orchestrated by the Elites. Nothing more nothing less. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> All you need to know is that some forces want you to be afraid and give up your rights for purported safety. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> well as long as Americans and Europeans are banned from entering, most part of Asia wouldn't have a second wave, period üòÅüòÅüòÅ </COMMENT 14>

<COMMENT 16> only smallpox is eridicated via vaccines, polio also reduced via vaccines but a real effort is need by all countries to discover covid-19 vaccines, we all want not to loose our loved ones </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Talking about a second wave does not apply, the first has not finished yet, based on what we have seen this would be an ongoing issue. The question is when we all be positive and/or vaccinated so we won‚Äôt have to worry about it. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> The biggest scam ever perpetrated on the human race it's wonderful how they use fear to control everyone we are like sheep listening to the mainstream media and our excuse for a goverenment </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> 6:20 'we are in trouble' and she laughs, mmm I bit of gravity wouldn't hurt much ladies, at least pretend you care about other people's lives more than your efing jobs. So disturbing and disgusting </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Almost sounds like a propaganda, vaccine is the only way, does pharmaceutical desperately wanna force them self to the world. H1n1 a million died, nobody treated it this way. Next why.not talk about boosting the immune system, vit a, c, D, lock down didnt help.  Its all $$ nobody wants any other answer than vaccine. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 2> Kc. 141:49 The earth is the paradise of the religious people and the politicians with the wars and plagues and epidemics. And as you are at the stage of nuclear weapons, God sends you nuclear diseases as I prophesied about it in 2002. Hospitals will be closed and schools and families and villages will be wiped out. Men will run away from men as one runs away from wild animals. My paradise cannot be this polluted world, sitting on bombs, this sick and crime-filled world.

But because of the sin and because of the churches, know that the world will go from suffering to suffering. And it shall come to pass that a man will not be able to shake hands with his brother or his best friend for fear of being contaminated with the disease. People shall walk without touching one another. Schools will be closed and you will hear people say: "I'm afraid of taking the underground or the bus, I am afraid of being contaminated.‚Äù You see? The righteous one will say to the wicked one: "Go and show off your nudity on the beach!" and the wicked one will tell him: "I won‚Äôt!". You see?

This is the dumbest developed nation on Earth. We are so selfish. It's not what you wanna do it's for the health and safety of the immunocompromised.

<COMMENT 9> As always the corrupt media twisting every word to misinform the people, trump just stated that USA has more cases because is testing a lot and if they test fewer like other countries they will report fewer cases. At no point he suggested that they will slowdown testing. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> You can stop testing all you want, but hospitalizations will remain the same, because when people can't breathe, they can't breathe and will be rushed there. The other problem too is that if we're going to test as much as we are, we need contact tracing, and not a lot of people are actually doing that in the US, hence why it won't go down and stay down. Not to mention people are ignoring social distancing and mask wearing, because in America it's only RECOMMENDED, thus people won't do it. </COMMENT 10>

<COMMENT 1> testing is a waste of time you can test negative in the morning and then catch in the afternoon just have to stay home until this is over even if you test immune you can be a carrier and infect other people are you going to test my shoes </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Dont want to generalize... but..... there is a reason why we see lot of "florida man". Chicago is in phase 4!!!ü•≥ü•≥ bc our gov mandated wearing face coverings/masks indoors and we stayed on lockdown longer. Where is your "freedom" now florida?? Ah??????? Your state is falling apart and the only argument the anti-mask idiots have is that they are not "sheeps" and God is protecting themü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è plz, dont go to hospitals if you fall in this category. Just, stay home pretend that the virus doesnt exist and prayüëç </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> The 10 year olds  or  other young people may just get the sniffles but may  carry that virus home to parents grandparents or aunts and uncles who in turn may and up in the intensive care unit or dead. You may not wear  a mask for yourself,  but Selfishness is not a virtue </COMMENT 3>

<COMMENT 5> Where is Lester Holt? </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> How many cases of corona virus are the New Yorkers bringing into the Miami/Dade and surrounding area. North Florida has few positives and few with any symptoms. How accurate are the tests? How many are false positives? </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> I believe our government is acting irresponsibly on the handling of this virus.  By their actions and their failure to take some actions, they are partially responsible for the deaths that have resulted and the continued spread of this virus.  We need real leadership by our president.  We need it now and always.  Trump and his team are definitely not the right people for this.  Let's hold them accountable and get some real leadership in the oval office. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Where is the data?

Why elicit emotional response with nothing to confirm what is stated?
Do your viewers have enough importance to provide them with this information?

<COMMENT 12> 37,000 new infections today. This poor excuse of human being in the white house has so much blood on his hands(125,000 x 5quarts to be precise). Imagine the lives that could have been saved if Mueller did his job, or if Bolton had a single ethical bone in his shriveled body. He should have been impeached. It didn't have to be this bad. What a totally crooked country. America is a very sick joke. ‚òπÔ∏è </COMMENT 12>

Commie Cuomo strikes again! </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> The FL stubborn governor is a nutcase who is killing people and destroying the local economy.   He is busy making babies and does NOT know how to handle a crisis. How do we get rid of this governor? </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Canadian here. I remember being blown away when I saw people at the water park on Memorial Day weekend when our restaurants bars and parks have been closed for 2 months. It‚Äôs so crazy how the narrative is soooo different there. A lot of people being interviewed were saying ‚Äúif I get sick I get sick...‚Äù a lot of people not really understanding the whole story. It‚Äôs not really that simple.. when you get sick now you‚Äôre taking up a hospital bed and overworked and overwhelmed health care workers have to take care of you and they have family they need to take care of too so now they‚Äôre at risk at spreading the disease to their loved ones. Sometimes things are so simple but they still need to be broken down in a way that people understand the severity of it. For people like me who live in Ontario summer is a big deal for all of us. It‚Äôs cold and miserable 75% of the time so we take summer seriously. Not being able to go to our parks and beaches is a huge sacrifice for us but we will gladly do it to stay alive. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Is crazy how this people control peoples perception and emotions.everyone forgat about the protest now everyone is focus back on corona cause that's where they want us </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 4> Less news on covid19 now it's all football rubbish taking your mind off a possible deadly 2nd wave not that the 1st wave was ever finished. No social distancing whatsoever now and with no cure and a government deliberately placing people in danger 2020 covid19 could run into mid 2021 </COMMENT 4>

<COMMENT 10> It will take 5 years to recover.
China (the CCP) should pay reparations.   The U.N should enforce it. </COMMENT 10>

<COMMENT 18> ok but does this mean i dont have to go to school </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> If we had lockdown as and when WHO recommended we wouldn't be in this economic trench. I doubt the government will show any greater competency in helping our economic recovery. </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 1> As always, we'd love to include your questions in our upcoming shows! What would you like to know about the coronavirus pandemic? #askDerrick </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Socialize big pharma! </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Let's stop lieying to ourself, we all know that the rich countries will get the vaccine first despite what world health organization says,,,"money talks ",,,i feel so sorry for Africa ,unless vaccine comes from Africa........    .......South Africa </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> BAN ALL CHINESE RELATED THINGS </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Destroy each kind of vaccine
Save Corona and save Nature </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Vaccines fo4 those who want it. Not everyone NEEDS the vaccination. The last organisations I would trust is the WHO, big Pharma, big Argo chemical corporations and governments. They already created much more mess, than they helped. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> we pay tax to an institution to protect and provide services for us. all governments have failed to protect us and now they expect us to pay for the covid vaccine? the governments should resign on grounds of incompetence before they ask public to pay for it. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> World war 3 </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> We Indians are from poor country but sure to have this vaccine first in our country. Reason ?! Major pharma companies will produce it for rest of the world from India only. Recently Remdesivir has been getting produced from India of Rs 5000 per dose. That same medicine the US produces of 1000 dollar per dose. That means around 70000 rupees. Well Indian middle class will grab it first for sure... </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> It is inevitable that people in affluent countries would want to travel, even to the less affluent countries so they would make sure that vaxx travels around the world. And speaking as from someone coming from one of those sh*thole countries, no reason for me to find prioritization of distribution of such vaxx insulting. Besides, tech has already advanced in such a way that they could replicate stuff gazillions of times if they want to and even keep such things from spoiling, so no worries much a vaxx has been synthesized. Fingers crossed. 

P.S. But of course, those who don't want to be vaxxed, need not be forced to do so. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> I will not be masked, tested, tracked or vaxxed. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Unbelievable so many comments here have no basic knowledge about vaccines before determined to anti-vaccine... Where is your scientific-educational role, media?
The vaccine requires several rounds of very restricted tests before permitting to clinical use, and that is why the vaccine is a none-of-sure thing yet by the beginning of next year. 
There are no live cells in vaccine... The vaccine is normally composed of protein fragments of virus (not the live virus), which can activate immune cells. So the immune system is trained to recognize the specific virus and destroy it, when people infected by the real virus. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> 1st world nations develop the vaccine and fund it, so they get it first.
Nothing wrong with that at all.

What would be wrong is not to share it with poorer nations because they can't pay the full price.
Obviously they should get it at a reduced price or for free. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> In the end, it's all business. 
The people who need vaccines the most will get at last. 
Power does matter </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> I thought this vaccine has baby heart stem cells </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> vaccines are a joke </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Ok there Comrade </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> I would truly suggest not the health care workers to get the vaccines first but the potential at risk group to get it first. As this is not any coronavirus but an artificial coronavirus mixed with HIV virus, you DO NOT want to use vaccine to kill the health care workers first. Let people see if any of these vaccines truly works on these risky groups first before applying them to the Health Care workers! Please, please and please... </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> For all the scientishes keeps work well to find some vaccines or treatments to reduce this pandemics. How long this pandemics would be end guys ? üåê </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> If these companies develop vaccines with the help of taxpayers money they can shove their patents where the sun dont shine. At best the royalties should be used to finance UBI. Or as Andrew Yang puts it, a freedom dividend. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 12> Why am I getting Covid-19 recommendations all from the UK, when I live in Sweden? A bit weird isn't it? </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> My theory is that the virus numbers are slowly fading away and they need to bring this news out as soon as possible as the big companies who invested in vaccines will now lose money as nobody will want the vaccine if there is no corona. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> The first one was a Hoax. Only your sheep believe in your Flu crap.. It's over with.. Go screw yourselves.. </COMMENT 14>

<COMMENT 18> If government testing is closing shop at the end of this month, the current spike will be nothing in comparison as to what's to come. Those who are financially strapped and working two jobs already are not doing so because they love it -- they have no choice in supporting their families. If it is a choice between the baby twins having milk and bread for the next week or purchasing a test from the grocery store, what will they choose?

Moreover, if the GOVERNMENT had done what the other countries had done in the first place, we would be where they are -- not as it is. Please, for God's sake -- do NOT vote for this imbecile to remain in office. This, of all things, should prove his incompetence and that MONEY is more important than the individuals. The reason he has not kept better control is that the price of his own stocks has decreased with people out of work. PERIOD.

Please, stop listening to others for a change and stop to think for yourself. Your life, or that of your family, may depend on it. </COMMENT 18>

<COMMENT 1> Good job premier Horgan and dr Henry for keeping the 14 day thing </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> I'd like to know why Premier John Horgan has personally authorized the misappropriation of tax dollars to censor his critics on social media. Wouldn't that money be better used for PPE, education, health care etc? </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> If governments and media reported incidents of, and deaths resulting from, car accidents they way they do this virus, no one would ever drive their car again. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> 45 people are COVID denying, conspiracy-obssessed Trumptards. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> MANDATE MASKS when in public indoor or crowded spaces already! OMG Fraser health has more numbers because they won't wear masks. I've stopped shopping in Langley and drive to Burnaby or Van because 50% are wearing masks there. I was literally laughed at for wearing a mask at the Langley Walmart by the self checkout attendant. She also came right up to me, like 18 inches from my face to speak to me and wasn't wearing a mask. NOT OK. I'm wearing a mask so its safer for them. They need customers, so they need to make it safer for us. Common sense, and common courtesy. COULD YOU PLEASE MANDATE MASKS ALREADY! Our numbers had completely decreased and now they are going up again, what was all that work for. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Stop babbling ...we just want the facts....tired of listen to you talk to the province like it‚Äôs a class of second graders </COMMENT 6>

TAKE BACK YOUR RIGHTS .
FIRE THE MEDIA .
END THIS CORRUPT GOVERNMENT. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Should just shut down schools. Leave it til September. Keep social distancing and wear mask </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> The recommendations of the provincial health officer are, by their nature, extremely conservative. It is the duty of a physician to save lives and ensure that under no circumstances should a life that can be saved, be lost. Her role is advisory. It is up to the Minister of Health to decide a course of action that is in the best interests of the province. Should the provincial economy be shut down because people are dying of old age? Do you sacrifice the province by shutting it down when leaving it open will not alter the final result? By making it appear that the little woman is calling the shots even though he is the one with authority the minister is shirking his responsibility to the citizens in this province that elected him. </COMMENT 18>

<COMMENT 6> Prof. Sucharit Bhakdi, medical  Doctor, medical microbiologist -  ‚Äúwe all have virus‚Äôs in our bodies, including all sorts of Corona viruses. Sometimes they flare up and people get symptoms such as a cough or a fever. In most cases the symptoms are mild and Covid 19 will behave just like the flu or cold.

Only old sick people may experience an accelerated dying process. Covid 19 is now blamed for everything and noted as cause of death. This is wrong and dangerously misleading. 

99% of people infected have no symptoms or just mild symptoms. But we don‚Äôt see that in the official data, where infected people are indicted as patients. That is absolutely incorrect! Most infected people never become ill! Yet they presented as such by the official authorities and that is serious deception.

What the authorities do right now, all these tests.. it is grotesque, exaggerated and dangerous. It will lead to far more deaths as a result of isolation, depression, anxiety attacks, high blood pressure and heart failure.‚Äù </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Brittan's, do not even think of trying to fly to America, we do not want you here. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> It's disgusting  that we still let people fly in  if the  risk  is  still  a threat" to our country, stop flights  altogether  atleast  untill  this covid is eradicated. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> So, we will be exporting Covid-19...   Go UK exports... </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Those poor countries must be pretty desperate for tourist money if they're letting people from the UK in. I cant think of a country in Europe that has done worse than us. You'd think maybe Belgium but that's because they are the most honest about their deaths... </COMMENT 10>

<COMMENT 2> Is Bolton F*cking nuts???!!!
Fact:  When the WHO was saying this could not be transmitted from person to person - Dr. Fauci, Jan. 21, 2020 said on New Jersey radio 101.5: "This is not a major threat for the people in the United States and this is not something that the citizens of the United States right now should be worried about." IT'S ON YOUTUBE!!! 10 days later, Trump went against his advisers and closed air travel from China!!! 
Who had better judgment???!!! </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Bolton is a lying idiot. In January, no one knows what this virus is capable of.  You don‚Äôt decide to close your economy just because there‚Äôs a rumor of a virus.  This event is unprecedented.  Unfortunately, he sounds more like a disgruntled ex-employee.  
CNN will use Bolton for their own political purpose.  Then when it‚Äôs about Iran, CNN will throw Bolton under the bus.
That‚Äôs how the political media works today. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> In March 2017, Cameron left her job at the¬†White House's¬†pandemic readiness office after four years. A year later it was disbanded (whether by design or by reorganization) by incoming National Security Advisor John Bolton.  This man is a damn jackass. His brain is in his mustache. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> NEVER forget this man is a Neoconservative, in the worst sense of the ideology. His solution is bomb first, talk later. Or, on a more local level, shoot and gas first then write a book about talking about the issue. His next book "The Streets Where It Happened"(subtitled as "but I was too busy promoting my previous book to actually do anything to make a difference."). </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> "he doesn't have any philosophy at all".....holy sh*t...I haven't agreed with Bolton on much of anything, but damn! </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Bolton = Sewer RAT gone canibl  , Drain the Sewer ! </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Speaking of Europe barring US travelers,  Bolton says "ultimately only the United States can solve the [coronavirus] problem" oblivious that Europe and almost the whole rest of the world *is* controlling the virus! </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> I‚Äôm not surprised he‚Äôs on CNN ..probably be on everyday. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Who is behind black lives matters.???    It's not what u think.... Who is really behind Antigua.....??   It not that hard to figure out.... Who have used these tactics to get rich.. As other countries fall..??? </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Please don't buy his book... </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Not hard to figure this guy out... He is obviously... A plant... Right before election..... Why would he not go under oath?   Gee I wonder.... He's A DEM, deep state, msm, globalist, new world order,,    guy...... Control the people. U Owen the people.... Just like china </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> How the world views Republicans and Bolton? Merely 21st century fascists and Trump merely brings out their true colours - or lack of lol. They've always been KKK to the core, and not sure why America is only waking up to it now. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Duh! Trump and his religious extremists will have their apocalypse regardless of who likes it. They MUST destroy America in order to make it seem like the god in which they pretend to believe is real and causing it all.
MANUALLY FULFILLED PROPHESIES </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> 1:10 Xi Jinping Trumps friend.. Bolton really knows that triggers Trump.. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> If Bolton had had any integrity, which he doesn't, when these alleged wrong doings occurred he would have confronted the President and then resigned in protest if the wrong was not corrected. But he did not do that, why? Because, as his former chief of staff at the White House says, these things did not happen. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> No bigger cover up than no testing. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Bolton is shit. Soft serve mush in a mustache. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> There's no systematic racism everybody needs to calm down and quote take a deep breathcan anybody anybody in this administration check their words for they come out there f****** mouth I don't like John Bolton but if you can help destroy Trump let's go it </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Both of them do not care about people . </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 2> I'm a software engineer working in Google. 5G actually is harmful for the health. So is 4G. The US military actually uses 5G waves of 60GHz as weapon to disperse crowds. You can watch such videos on YouTube. 5G can also interfere with our ability to absorb oxygen. But this is true only for the 5G frequencies which are of 60GHz. Coming on to a more serious topic; Old people have been dying of the flu anyway; only right now the general population got to know about it from the Rothschild controlled media. 26000 people die from starvation... EVERY SINGLE DAY. If the WHO(created by the Rothschild) cares so much out the people why wasn't it using the 3-4trillion dollars on feeding the starving people? If these 'conspiracy theories' are actually so stupid, then why did YouTube ban David Icke and Doctor Rashid Buttar and many more?

<COMMENT 1> Given that the internet has been around for over 20 years, and "downsizing" and "restructuring" even longer, it's surprising that it has taken a pandemic to give companies a boot in the rear into allowing and promoting remote work. People waste sooooooooo much time, money and mental energy getting up early, bathing, shaving, ironing and putting on expensive suits, rushing, fighting and getting stuck in traffic, parking, dealing with bosses, office politics, gossiping, favoritism, unhealthy snacks and lunch, and back home again. With remote work, there is no commute, no traffic, no boss . . . just in your pajamas. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> For a second I thought it was about The Office the show </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> 20% new norms! </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> It was distrust. The sort of managers who don't do any real work expected everybody else to skive off if not kept in view. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> What about social contact? I think we are being dehumanized. I Will not be surprised if in a few years, less than we may think, we will be replaced by AI. The elite is getting what they want. It‚Äôs easier to control people that are trapped in their homes . </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Make sure you all work from home. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> The office already died when Steve Carrell left </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> If the office is about networking isn't that bad for productivity? It's often demoralising to see the socially adept, but fundamentally lazy and barely competent, rise primarily on networking. I do believe productivity gains from remote working shown in this pandemic reflect the increased mental wellbeing from not being trapped with the networkers who dominate office politics. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Does mothers in America exists Hollywood taught is wrong again. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> And then in a decade or even less machines will replace even those who work at home.

Beware the dawn of the metal age. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> I will replace them all with much more efficient AI robots instead who is able to work around the clock. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Interesting of the effects of the changes with Office space will effect our pensions. A lot of pension funds are tied to office space rentals. </COMMENT 12>

<COMMENT 17> From 4:10 to 4:30 what did Alice Fulwood say?    "??? knowledge job ??? other jobs that are dependent on that job. Some of these are high-skilled like lawyers and doctors, but most of them are lower-skilled jobs like baristas, ??? instructors, and other sort of urban services. Once you add up the ??? they contribute, the majority of Americans are employed in a way which means that they are dependent  on knowledge jobs." </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> At 7:30, with "like corporate culture, and creativity... and these will be the..." -- the sentence starting with "and these will be the" is in a very different, soft voice -- strange </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> I am all for 50/50 work from home and office. When people work from home, it takes cars of our roads and eases public transport commuters. We can find a balance of both WFH and office commuting </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> The moment everyone proves they can do their jobs from home is the moment you show your job can be done from ANY home.  Homes where people would gladly do your job for 1/2 or 1/10th of your salary.  Think that your productivity or talent at your job will justify your salary? Those don't matter. Companies have shown 9 times out of 10, they will choose to pay someone half your salary for half your productivity or half the quality of work. If they didn't, they wouldn't be price competitive against a company that was doing that. This will bring about the collapse of cities and white collar work. Everyone will rue the day that they can work from home and wish they had to drive into the office. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 1> They are so stupid.  Instead of telling the chinese or whoever to test it on their own people.  I'm going to call Malema to see what he knows about this.  Ridiculous. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> I came here to see how many people actually know what's up with these vaccinations...AND I  COULDNT BE MORE PROUD! Bill Gates and his big pharma friends have an agenda to vaccinate the entire world. They'll tell you its conspiracy to make it sound far fetched, but its not. Vitamin A and C kill the virus. A REAL immunologist by the name of Dr Shiva has exposed the lies and fake science behind the coronavirus. DO NOT TAKE THE VACCINE!!!!!!!!!! FOOD IS MEDICINE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> All about money . In the US the numbers are crazy . Why South Africa . They getting huge incentives from the Bill Gates foundation. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> This is BS. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> NOPE </COMMENT 5>

<COMMENT 14> Just because you‚Äôre infected doesn‚Äôt mean your going to die.  Our Africans brothas and sisters can‚Äôt be that stupid.  They trying too kill your!  Why they not trying that on white people? </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> This is NOT a black/white issue.  Look more closely at the headline: ..."South Africa's first Covid 19 vaccine trial."  NOT "South Africa IS the first."  Wake up and stop trusting the media.  Others have already begun trials, in the UK, Brazil, and China.  None of which are "Black" countries.   If more "White" countries had begun trials, I am sure the media would condemn them for not helping African nations begin trials earlier.  Stop drinking the Coolaid and quit imagining racism in every event. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> These fools are allowing themselves to be tested like guinea pigs by these racist countries. Why didn't they start the trials in the US or Europe where the numbers are greater. If you are getting this vaccine you are stupid. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Africa have NO covid!! Stop testing fake vaccine on black people! Start in America first, people are dying in America! Leave Africa ALONE!!! </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Are yall that stupid? </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Why use Africa first while you can‚Äôt do it at the place of the origin country which started the Coronavirus this is bs I swear. Wait till they die from this vaccine and they‚Äôll say ‚Äòthey have Coronavirus‚Äô I know they think of us black people as the experiments since most people don‚Äôt like our race </COMMENT 19>

I mean Christ! What is the point in investing in someone who takes their gender before their Job!! That is a violation of the publics trust... We don't care.. just do your Job under the Rule of Law, not altered to your emotional state of chemical confusion and loss of empathy scientifically proven by chemical drug users!!!  ...as we are A Bi-Joural country and the Educated have no problem bring this to our Common Law courts at the appropriate time!! ...Do your job and if your progress of Transgendering is effecting your work, then You are Liable in your position and should not have taken the Job on until you had completed your life altering surgery and change of kind like Darwin says...(we are the only species on the planet to ever change kind from mankind to humankind...and now we change gender!!)... obviously easy to see why... Do watch here on youtube: CBC 5th Estate The Secrets of Sugar Doc!!  ... yeah.... maybe you should have finished your mutation before taking on the Job!! Happy to see you in Court...any time!! Someone has to return the rule of law to this land... the government staff are too frigging impaired and they are allowing the impairment of the citizens...but then that is the prophecy of those ancient peoples... isn't it!!!

<COMMENT 1> Garbage </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Can one of you conspiracy theorists please explain why, Dan Andrews wants us locked away in houses? Please, enlighten me. I've seen this virus first hand, it's real. Not everything you see on you tube is real guy.
I assume these same people believe the earth is flat. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> The reason why we got a spike in covid-19 is quasimoto Victorian premier Daniel Andrew  doesn't know what he's doing . He's getting advice from a charlatan chief medical officer Brett Sutton. classic example he's got to Essendon players James Stewart and Conor McKenna locked up in 14 days quarranty they had 5 covid-19 test  all come back negative. The first thing that quasimoto Daniel Andrew is to sack Brett sutton </COMMENT 3>

<COMMENT 10> Hey smart people where is the vaccine? </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Don't let them send you bankrupt! 
This is just wealth transfer (agenda 21) Right on time
CV19 isn't dangerous unless you have compromised health issues!
They want everyone to be poor so your dependent on their system. 
Then they attack food supply chain. Your dependent again.
The socialist communists want to loot & burn it all so you have nothing! They then take the wealth & give it to top officials who are the most ruthless! The real threat is the economic collapse! 
Don't be suckers! </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> I see they are doing mass infection testing, should have had that in place when they allowed the mass rallies üòâ </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Yep, stoopid Vic. govt. Focused on their commie ambitions, instead of the health of Victorians. Vic-people, Mexicans, southern folks - GET RID OF LABOR (and don't vote for dirty, grubby Libs or Grns). </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> This comment section needs a disclaimer. There are a lot of vocal idiots here. Have a little read of the Dunning-Kruger effect. Good for a laugh but it sums up beautifully why you should be suspicious of the confident and outspoken voices on YouTube. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Can we please have some more BLM rallies - might thin a few whingers out of the system. If their lives mattered so much to the whingers they should have stayed home. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Am i ever going 2 get tested 4 COVID again, Now way, Getfkd ,fkoff </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> its amazing how are oh so privileged society freaks out at what is comparatively a small crisis if you remember the mass genocide that takes place everyday and does not get a mention ,this is exactly what we need to wake up  ,any life is important!! </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Thats why comments are banned in australia because there is informed people who know exactly whats going on with main stream media bullshit and the fuckwit politicians who all need to go jail now </COMMENT 18>

<COMMENT 2> We'll have to close all schools, playgrounds and daycare centres forever now!! </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> The conspiracy theorists are speaking again.. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Here is the thing. She lived up to that point with whatever her underlying condition was. Lets say it was type 1 diabetes. Most people think type 1 is pretty benign. The reality is misjudging your blood sugars can get you in dangerous territory fast and illness wreeks havok with them. So my question is "would this child have died of the underlying condition if she hadn't contracted COVID?"
I have friends with both type 1 and asthma. Both carry risks on their own. But if you die of complications from either after getting COVID isn't COVID still the cause? </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Fear mongering. Business as usual </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> The government should cut funding from scientists because they are making up this "scamdemic" and are basically trying to steal all our money in an attempt to make a "fake vaccine". The coronavirus is not real, it is a ploy created by the government to keep us in our homes, granting them the freedom to carry out whatever shady business they need to deal with without people witnessing them. </COMMENT 6>

<COMMENT 14> It is terrible for the parents and the rest of the family to lose such a young child like that. It is unclear whether the child could had died from COVID-19 or maybe her underlying health conditions might had led her to her death. Who knows? </COMMENT 14>

<COMMENT 18> Global News needs to be reported, this is absolutely 100% without a doubt false reporting and Global knows it. Even the wording in the video is better as the child "died with" COVID-19 i.e. she had it and died from other things. She did not die "FROM" COVID-19. </COMMENT 18>

<COMMENT 19> There are so few good arguments for resuming the season this way. This season is shot and the plan to complete it is downright bizarre. The safety risks, the Florida situation, the bubble and being away from family, players opting out, PLUS it screws up *next season* too. Teams will load manage every player because of the compacted season. Forget it. Blow this up. Start next season early and make it awesome. More time for the same number of games, less load management, more time to figure out how to handle life with the virus. I'm done with this circus. </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 2> How you do all of this with your patients as well is amazing.  I first started to look at your videos when I was diagnosed with COPD.  Partially as a result of watching your videos I was able to see that the testing wasn't done properly and I actually don't have COPD I have hyper reactive airways.  Basically a smoking induced asthma.    I have found even the complicated issues i.e. clotting with Covid 19 to be very well explained on your videos.  You do this stuff so very well.  Thanks. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Some researchs point out that the antibody in human body could only last from several weeks to 3 months, which means if a person recovered, he could get infected again in 3 months.

That's a very bad news for vaccines, especially consider that people get infected again are usually more serious than those who don't infected before( ADE effect).

Hope human can find more powerful vaccines that allows antibody lasts longer. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Can you explain the potency of convalescent plasma therapy for COVID19...? </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> At the end you discuss, Daily death rates. You asked is it a different population, maybe younger who are less likely to die. No, as of June 13, on CDC, you can click on age groups to see who is being admitted.  Still 65-85 is the bulk. So, the death rate is going down for older individuals. Don't know why yet. 
https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/covidnet/COVID19_3.html </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Just w8 for the FAI... </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> FAI is waving... </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> I really appreciate your videos, and I learn a lot every time I watch, but I get an annoying pause every 3 seconds - it makes them very difficult to watch.

Your videos are the *only* ones with which I have this problem. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> I believe asprin is used in heart patients to prevent clotting. Wouldn't it be possible that something so simple, and I would imagine, safe may help, even if it's just a little? </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> I have just recovered from CoViD with mild symptoms. Just waiting for my 2nd swab test result. But I just wanna know about how long does my antibodies give me an immunity against re-infection from covid? </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> The video below shows that recovered asymptomatic covid19 patients can be reinfected because the level of neutralizing antibodies dropped quickly (within 2 months). Therefore, a strategy based on herd immunity or vaccines might be ineffective.

<COMMENT 12> Dexamethasone only what if you add procaine booooooooom, that's FAI/FIB vaccine developed 35 yrs ago for covid19 buster.Wait to Launch in Indonesia very very soon for security reason no update the FAI/FIB vaccine. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> WRT to dexamethasone in this trial. The half life is 36 hours. That would imply that it takes 7 to 8 days to reach maximal stable levels using a once a day dosing regimen. Using the drug for 6 days seems to give less than a day or so of maximal level on a qd regimen. Should they have loaded the patients with a higher 12 to 18 mg dose to really say that they treated for six days? Further, 6 mg per day seems like a low therapeutic dose, considering that severe asthma is treated with doses of 4 mg q6h of dexamethasone. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Any info on vaccines from Medicago, a Canadian company funded by DARPA to develop vaccines for noravirus and rotavirus, presumably for the military to prevent spread of these viruses in crowded military sites.  Use a tobacco plant for generation of viral antigens. They announced Corona virus work in January. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> üî∫ Information üî∫ I had the virus and he attack where it hurts but  I understood that I had an unusual inflammation with this virus and what I need to take
I know it's my only chance, i can't see anything else, time is running out, and finally > luck with me !!!
So I took anti-inflammatory  (4x 20mg Piroxicam)
first two, then 3, and in the 4th it was ok
with spirulina (because I didn't have aspirin to make circulate the blood well)
and 2 dafalgan (paracetamol) for temperature
... and my condition quickly returned to normal !!!
an anti-inflammatory is not a drug! say it again you can do it .... an anti-inflammatory is not a drug !!! but a medicine!
scientifically, I would be dead, the doctors said that I was very lucky ! I could be die !!! but he don't trust me
üî∑ The way to fight the virus is therefore to use "anti-inflammatories and anti-coagulants
I speak the first day ... the most difficult if you have health problems, it's just a remedy to get out of the crisis
after you survive the first day you win against the virus and anti-inflammatory  are no longer needed
and you can take paracetamol if you have a headache for the next few days + anti-coagulant
You can take an antibiotic like azithromycin or another broad spectrum antibiotic, for security measure
so You survive the first day? be care for the others, after we stay contagiuous 3 weeks min
I hope that afterwards we can find a vaccine but ... now the urgency is to save lives ... why I hear always dead ..??
sorry for my bad english but hope you understand essential! this is my experience
... please STOP with the dead ... please share! Thank you

<COMMENT 19> Huffingtonpost has an extensive article written by someone who suffers from long-term (months-long) persistent problems after "recovering" from COVID-19. There is also a support group for such folks, apparently. Dr Seheult, can you  make video that discusses the issues related to long-term persistent problems for patients who survive (don't die) COVID-19 but have not been able to restore their health?

<COMMENT 20> Hydrogen inhalation is anti-inflammatory and resolves all COVID-19 symptoms in most cases.  Anyone NOT using hydrogen as a treatment is complicit in excess deaths.  China has been using it from the beginning as one of it's primary treatments.  Hydrogen has ZERO negative side effects.  Hydrogen can be used prophatically or as a treatment to mitigate the cytokine storm.

<COMMENT 1> Seriously, why are people still supporting Trump. He literally wants to slow testing down just to not (rightfully) augment the US case numbers. What Trump and all his supporters don't understand is that THERE IS STILL A VIRUS GOING AROUND and people are DYING! Just because you don't see it, doesn't mean it's not there. I mean you can't see your brain, but it's there right? Not sure if this statement applies to Trump's supporters through. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Trump has turned a country that once lead by example into a laughing stock ALL for nothing more than political gain and reelection. He should be ashamed and embarrassed. I am a Republican and will vote for ANYONE but Trump in november. He is pathetic. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> TRUMP......NO.....ONE.....CARES....what you think about the pros and cons of scientific testing for ANY disease. You are NOT QUALIFIED to make a judgement on science based testing. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Trump is right, Anderson. 

Those ICU's that are filling up with patients on life support for 2....3...4 weeks? 

Fake news.

Those family members who are currently making funeral arrangements for their loved ones who died from COVID-19?

Fake news. 

Ask Alex Jones......just like the staged massacre at that Sandy Hook grade school----and the bodies of children photographed being carried out on bloody stretchers? Fake news. And the coroners reports on the bodies of those children.....fake news. 

What is this nation coming to? </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> The 3rd world is suffering as a result of you bill gates. People are dying in the name of bill gates and George Soros RIGHT NOW. There will be no more 3rd world countries, because when the 1st world collapse that means the 3rd world DIES. Oh and I bet your just happy with that because you, Bill Gates, have been experimenting with Africa for YEARS! MURDERING them & Giving them cancer, birth deformities from your ‚Äúawesome‚Äù vaccinations. You deserve capital punishment. You will not be our non electric human health overlord that‚Äôs demonstrated you‚Äôll lie, steal from your partners, cheat code, in order to get what you want.  Oh and it‚Äôs not like your father and you believe in planned parenthood and DEPOPULATION lol. CNN, Gates, George Soros, Hillary Clinton, John Podesta and big tech if you want us to die, WELL YOURE DYING WITH US! You think you globalist can brainwash, murder, and take away our rights and impose FEAR to the mass majority of Americans for long? People are going to start waking up and you are going to be the first person America‚Äôs gonna wanna burn down. Burn in hell, all of you demons. Also why isn‚Äôt Hillary Clinton In PRISON??????? </COMMENT 5>

<COMMENT 7> Cooper is a liberal and stands with Biden that they know that he won't win and they give sleepy Joe a free pass . Hahaha what a joke </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Covid-19 is a joke. If they are saying for everyn1 person positive for covid 19 there are 10 more. So let me get this right the death rate would be something like 0.004ish. Just rough math but that's what I come up with. FYI.   If you put everyone in one room, yes it'll look like the hospital is full. It's bull. To many doctors from UNMH have even said they see more come in with the common flu. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Corrupt CNN </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> This president is walking with satan himself, to even joke about Americans dying  of this virus  shows how evil he is. He should be removed from office. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> I can't find the order where he write to slow the testing. Can anyone help me find it? </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> When Cooper and Lemon die from aids, I wonder if that will be called a covid death? </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Didn't Joe Biden say it was 120 million that has died. I'm confused. How many have actually died.. . I feel like I am being lied to. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Trump needs to be jailed for negligence and mass murder and lack of common sense and stupidity. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> i love that america is officially going to be a shithole country that no one wants the citizens to visit from. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> I wonder if Cooper gets aroused when he changes his son's diaper.  Poor kid. </COMMENT 16>

<COMMENT 19> trump is delusional ...He has lied so much he actually lives in a bubble in his own world... 
Europe would be crazy NOT to bann Americans you guy's are going to lose a lot more people and trump should be arrested.

How much of a coward would you have to be to be too scared to say "when was the last time you spoke to the President"? </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Why does trump always sound like someone giving a bad comedy act on stage lmao. the crowd erupted when all he did was repeat Kung Flu when someone shouted it out, and he tried to follow it up with more heat comments like ‚Äúyeah Kung flu yeah...  covid! Covid-19, I said what does that mean 19 that‚Äôs an odd name‚Äù lmfao he might as well of said ‚Äúcovid 19, what‚Äôs up with that?‚Äù </COMMENT 20>

Miss Technocrat Henry can continue with her pseudo-science social engineering, She is so giddy and enthusiastic to keep control of people by fear contagion. If she had one bone of honesty left in her though, she would report the daily deaths from opioids and other reasons of death to give proportion and a sense to the consequences of the government's deadly lockdown measures. It's time to RELAX distancing and limit testing and distancing to the sick and vulnerable only. </COMMENT 18>

Isn't more people with the covid virus great for HERD IMMUNITY??

Tests could be obsolete the day, week, months after a given test...tests ingredients need to be given to each person tested, HERD IMMUNITY IS MORE EXPEDIENTLY AQUIRED WITH SURGING INFECTIONS?

ARE SURGING CASES MORE DESIREABLE WHEN HERD IMMUNITY IS 90% ACHIEVED...without Testing! </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> If a government forces it's citizens to live in a protective bubble during flu season,  not allowing their immune systems to do what they were created to do, the number of infections are going to surge when they're released. It ain't rocket science. And by the way, the polls said  Clinton would easily beat President Trump in 2016. </COMMENT 2>

This is more of an attempt by the media to steal headlines again after all the looting/rioting took over.  This is FAKE NEWS.  Listen to tone of her voice.  Designed to implement fear mongering again.. Notice they lack FACTS again!!!  they do not tell how many, nor do they tell how may have NO Symptoms and No Hospitalizations.  Don't fall for this lie.  It's the media's attempt to have more restrictions in place to submit to rogue governors and mayors ALL in an effort to discredit what President Trump has done BECAUSE it's an election year!  People by the masses have NOT been going out to get tested.  If anything - there is COVID fatigue in place!  This is ONLY about population control. </COMMENT 5>

<COMMENT 6> I think many people, myself included, were more cautious at the beginning of all this than now. Now that so much information has come to light it seems absurd to maintain that same level of fear that we all felt to varying degrees at the beginning. Now we know that there is a 99% survivability rate (approx.), that the numbers have been inflated the whole time, that ventilators kill people (9/10), that hydrochloriquine and zinc may help treat a large number of sick people or can be taken preventatively by at risk populations but it is being banned in certain hospitals (namely the one in NY's epicenter), that wearing masks doesn't help protect one from viruses (it even says so on the package). I could go on. While calling people who solely believe the mainstream media narrative  sheep can be harsh, I do understand the frustration people feel when they try to help others wake up by sharing information from a variety of sources only to be labeled "crazy conspiracy theorists". Divide and conquer seems to be at play here. It's been challenging but any way we can unite with others and just be kind to each other will be helpful. Divided we fall after all. </COMMENT 6>

<COMMENT 1> Do you have a question about COVID-19 or the coronavirus pandemic? Ask our science correspondent Derrick Williams here! #askDerrick </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> I will worry when I have to step over bodies lying in the street. So far I don't know anyone sick from anything. 
But I met a person who said she knows someone who knows someone who know someone that knows someone that died of cv or whatever they call the common cold now. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> It was working yes BUT nations hurried to reopen so it went from bad to worse damnit </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Lessons Learned? The World is "Learning" but our President Trump is ignoring, denying and sabotaging the Learning Process at every stage!!
 Help!!üò´ </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> The Lockdown saved Lives! The Lockdown also alleviated  the stress on Healthcare systems. This is true for much of the United States but, as the World can see, opening up too quickly and with a lack of protection on the part of the people has only added to the death toll when death could have been prevented! Now, our President is defunding testing and dismantling Healthcare for Millions of people. It's as if Trump WANTS more people to die and for people to pay out of pocket so the Government does not!! Trillions of dollars in Aid, set aside for the people and the science, has gone unaccounted for! Trump is dismantling America piece by piece! </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> If you are an international bank who lends  money to governments in need , throwing their countries in forever debt , global coronavirus lockdown , works GREAT. You will want to never end. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Who really believes this BS ? </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> 2:23 If there's a legacy that would be nice to be carried through normal lives in the future post-pandemic, that got to be those hand sanitizer dispensers free for everyone to use and seen everywhere, not just loos, washrooms or toilets. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> What mistakes did the WHO make?? I do not think you can report and say mistakes were made but not explain the mistakes you are referring to </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Lockdowns worked very well. Lots of countries are mostly covid free already. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Comparing the numbers from the hypothetical total pandamic outbreak to the current death toll. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> UK has 53000 deaths not 43000, 10000 died in care homes.. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> 2:17 wow, the poorest and stupidest way of reporting things i've ever seen. what, am i computer remembering every data on the planet??? (tl;dr - where is the current data for comparison???)

haa 2:55 so, u expect me to switch back and forth??????

6:57 - "not all countries are ready... thats why, lockdown" yup, very nice input üëç. I can agree with this. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> It's not over at all! </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Just look at the United States. A truncated lockdown (due to claims of tyranny and a concern for capitalism) coupled with extremely ineffective government intervention... equals a death rate six times the average. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> In Sweden, the people have access to healthcare. In the USA there are 10's of millions of people who have no access to healthcare.  The USA will probably have millions of deaths by the time this is done. And we still have another 6 months of the worst President ever. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Death numbers in Hindia? </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Once I saw Neil Ferguson here , that phony  lying hypocrite sneaking around to boink his mistress while telling us all to stay at home , I HAD  enough. What a  sick joke this all IS . Some hypocritical scientist giving politicians his two bit advice. FRAUD. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Like an Apocolypse? </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 1> Why the people protesting didn‚Äôt think about increasing the cases before went the  streets .  Why this Dr didn‚Äôt say anything before or during the protesting people ?  That‚Äôs strange?? </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> No iam not trump iam a woman </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> They have to  get that vacine going and that's all it will take and the virus will be gone in no time the virus will be gone in a few minutes </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> What they should do is have a legitimate testing crew go home to home and test at least 1 member of the house hold to determine those who been exposed and who hasn't, so it can for sure determine just how bad the spread actually is or isn't. So this way there will be no more guessing. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> fauci sounds like he already has covid </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> There is a serious lack of empathy and compassion but abundance of ignorance in the US nowadays. The elders and vulnerable are dying like flies and yet its people and politicians can't agree on the obvious benefits of wearing masks. What a doomy reality! </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Here is what my very smart daughter whom is getting her Master's Degree in Public Health from Tulane university had to say: 

I am not a complainer, but I find it very hard to stay quiet as COVID-19 continues to escalate. To begin, I have spent over 3 months trying to control my asthma. I am currently doing breathing treatments 8 times a day as well as taking four other medications to control it, yet I still can't breathe on a daily basis. Almost everyone in my family is immunocompromised as well, so COVID-19 is a very scary situation for us. We haven't left the house in months, except for my dad who leaves only for essentials with a mask with tons of hand sanitizer. This is NOT a joke.
Not only are we immunocompromised, but I also just graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Public Health, and I am currently specializing in Epidemiology (the study of the distribution and determinants of health and disease) for my Master's Degree. I am no expert, but every single professor I have talked to has emphasized the importance of mitigating the spread of this and every disease.
To my friends who have been going out without wearing a mask, not social distancing, or pretending COVID-19 is over: I see you. I don't care if you think COVID-19 is "like the flu" and it "won't be that bad if you get it." You are selfish. Period. COVID-19 is contagious for TWO DAYS before you experience any symptoms, so it is entirely possible to spread it to someone who is immunocompromised, resulting in severe illness or death. On top of this, young healthy people have been dying from this disease, so DO NOT underestimate it.
With Tulane opening up in the Fall, many of my friends are looking forward to going back and seeing each other. On the other hand, I will have to continue taking my classes online, unable to see anyone with the threat of COVID-19, as advised by my doctor.
I am not asking for your sympathy. I am asking you to wear a mask, sanitize often, and social distance. It's not a huge ask, but it can save thousands of lives. To those who still refuse to do this, please consider thinking about others and not just yourself </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> thankfully, dr. fauci  is cancelling the NFL season so president trump won't have to take a knee to kiss colin kaepernik's super bowl ring. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> PLAN A.  DO NOT TAKE THE VACCINE.      PLAN B.  DO NOT LISTEN TO THIS MORON.           PLAN C    WE NEED TO FIRE FUCHI. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> AMAZING NEWS !!  https://youtu.be/giK98fNZ08c </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> I am from india and i would like to ask every citizizen of the world except china that why dont we all stand together and start boycotting china. we indians, our main mottoo is to bring peace all over the world and countries like china, their motto is to extend their land mass maybe this was the reason with what they did in coronavirus outbreak, they never wanted that news to be leaked and now the whole world is suffering from economic crisis and poverty is increasing. We need brotherhood and unity all over the world so why dont we both india and usa stand together to make a change. my dear brothers and sisters this is just the initialisition and i am not doing this for publicity, please share this comment as a screenshot on all social media platforms.

Them thar people are plants hired by the mask maker company!  No virus is a match for me AR15!  Whewwhy!  Stars and bars!  Robert E. Lee!  Don't trust the government!

<COMMENT 4> Hopefully the governors in those states start using their brains and find the brake pedal. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> The pharmaceutical industry is the most profitable business world wide, so senior 94 years old Gates commanded his son junior 64 years old Bill to invest into biochemistry to create huge market for his medications to downsize world's population to five hundred million only. Gates Sr is the head of Washington state's planned parenthood organization since 6 decades. Bill Gates Jr makes huge profits on vaccines, because all his 105 billion dollar is invested in biochemistry, and he just bought a six hundred fifty million dollar super hydro yacht, and he smiles so happily in the last five months, but why?????? BILL GATES JEFFREY EPSTEIN ROTHSCHILD CREATED CORONA VIRUS IN ISRAEL SECRET LABORATORIES AND MOSSAD SPREADS VIRUS WORLD WIDE. YOU MUST DO MAXIMUM THROUGH STUDY THE PARENTS OF BILL GATES (64) ESPECIALLY SENIOR GATES (94) AND BILL HOW AGGRESSIVELY MONEY AND POWER HUNGRY HE IS, especially in last 12 months, because Bill can not bear the fact that Jeff Bezos surpassed him financially. Bill Gates Jr finances Chinese laboratories for virus research, including in Wuhan 5,5 million u.s. dollars annually, so this an international jewish conspiracy under Rothschilds command. POWER HUNGRY CON ARTIST BILL GATES DEVELOPED VIRUSES IN ISRAEL. JEWISH MOSSAD SPREADING CORONA VIRUS TOO TO MAKE BILL GATES THE WORLD'S RICHEST MAN FOR EVER GO VEGAN !!!!!!!! </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> That blond nurse was reading from a script. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Did they honestly believe that what happened in NYC, for instance, was not in their future? They are literally talking like this is a surprise to them.  But, of course, that does not take anything away from the tasks right in front of them now. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> You should all go on strike immediately. It's the only way u will ever be paid the hazard pay that u should be paid and protected with PPE. This country is evil. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Imagine being someone older or immune compromise..... basically seeing this is going to be your life for the unforeseen future </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> I think their eyes would look way sadder. Instead they are READING... </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> I have underlying conditions and have a son who needs me.   I take this serious and wear a mask and yet as I walk through a store in Arizona I am met with many smug looks, people deliberately coughing to be funny.  Big deal!  Right? Get over it!  I overlook it except my sister is an RN and I see what the Medical pros are going through and it makes me a little angry that people are not taking this serious. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> See 7 out of 10 people are just plain stupid, or just do not care about anybody else. ( I am going to have fun and get drunk and i don't care if i get covid-19 and I don't if you get Covid-19. It is all about me. ) This is what we have in a Trump America. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> We are helpless to the nature for we did huge injustice to nature and the Creator of the universe. We're still careless. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> The hospitals are empty and there losing money cause no patients are comming in and the beds are empty omg people wake up already and go see for yourself!!! The media just makes stuff up as they go along its like a fictional tv show LMFAO </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Just send them home that's all they can do. </COMMENT 15>

<COMMENT 18> Where is this taking place what state </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> By having politized this virus we have made it much more dangerous. Before herd immunity it needs to infect 70 plus percent of the population and if 2 to 3 percent have severe illness and die, that is millions out of the 320 million Americans. If the hospitals are overwhelmed they begin to triage. People with cancer, strokes, heart attacks, and accidents don't get treated. It not just about an isolated disease, it's a cascading event. Do far only about 8 to 10 percent have been infected. Those are the ones we know about. </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 2> I never understand some countries leaders , when medical ( even your OWN doctors) &  WHO advice beware & take all necessary precautions to prevent spread of the virus , they not only dont care but continue rally & moving around like no body business.

<COMMENT 17> 1 - Brazil is still 10th in number of Covid deaths by 1 million people. Behind Belgium, Spain, Italy, UK, France, Sweden, Netherlands...

2 - Covid will keep killing many more people in many countries. There will be 2nd, 3rd waves...

3 - Black Lives Matter protests by the left all around the world will have a BIGGER effect on spike of Covid cases than Bolsonaro's stupid antics. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Wonder why masks were not used in world war II... they are protecting vs everything........ Honestlyyyyyy </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> It is difficult for a foreigner to understand what is happening in Brazil! Any news carried by the media is left-wing! And if they are not on the left, they are from people who do not understand the dynamics that exist in how politics is done here! The population begins to take an interest in what happens in Brazil and with that much of what is done is still incipient! But we are fighting for the country to change its ideology and to mark our steps towards what corrupt politicians hate! Informed information! The virus is not lethal, but it is worrying, as it is clear that the victim's choice is linked to immunity and that a lot is already known about it .... And that politicians are taking advantage of the virus's opportunity to overthrow the government! We are fighting for the corrupt to go to jail, and for our supreme federal court not to release them! And that politicians assume their mandates, not for their pockets, but so that the population has the right to have concrete opportunities and not unrealistic fantasies of promises never kept! We will change the history of Brazil! With Bolsonaro president until the end! </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 1> What a joke, you guys covering this and not Auston Matthews Covid??? </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Main Stream Media garbage. Tge PGA tour, Nick Watney,positiv for corona virus.100 players,caddies,volunteers,no mask no soci. distancing.
BLM, no mask no social distancing in USA,Europe,Australia..Novak,Adria tour charity for corona victims.Good Idea if main stream media  donate some money for corona victims,insted of spreding hate. Corona has become our reality. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Oh now we are upset with Djokovic?? When he made all the nationalist and discriminatory statements against Albanians of Kosovo, that was just fine because who cares!!! You all start to care when you see a window for making money because you know Covid is sexy right now! Hypocrites that pick and choose what news interests you to bring to the public and get rich!!  Djokovic is an ignorant pig that doesn't deserve to be on TV ever - I care less about his talents and neither should the world of sports - Lets drain the swamp of sports from trash like him!! The end! </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> He is an anti-vaxxer as well! </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> This will go down as one of the biggest deceptions in history. The masses are so brainwashed that they can't see beyond 6 ft while waiting for the saviour that is the vaccine to kill them. There will be no return to normal because of their stupidity. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Shame on you!! If you have to be the GOAT, it is not always how good you play on court but how you present yourself on and off court....that includes showing unnecessary anger tantrums on court like John Mcenroe or disregarding all the warning signs to go ahead and organize an event and put everyone in danger including yourself. Djokovic's intention might be good but you have to think about the warnings, and use protection...none were followed. Now that you are a father, your kids safety should have been a priority and now you and Jelena tested positive puts your kids at greater risk...mature soon Djokovic, hopefully before retirement. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> I think it's a classic case of humans thinking because they have a special talent, therefore they are above nature/god or whaterver u subcribe too.  Hence the reason why Covid is such a beautiful lesson, Everybody can get it. </COMMENT 7>

You proved to be worst once again...
When people are dying every day in lakhs with this pandamic ,the way you guys danced , celebrated is shameful and out of mankind....
As a head of ATP you hold more responsibility than others and should set an example...
If the tournament were organised with pure heart it would have been so different..it would have set an example...
Look at the way they enjoyed...
Now Djokovic is another Corono super bomb....
You are a shameless idiot...
No mankind and humanity...
You need only money and finally you provide lame excuses.... </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 1> Isn't it just so COINCIDENTAL that when the fake Russian hoax didn't take down Trump, in comes-conveniently- a pandemic from China. The virus is real. The regulations, the lockdown are all one big manipulation by Democrats known for their  "We never waste a crisis". 
We all know this is a pathetic attempt by Democrats to destroy the economy. All you've done is create more Trump supporters. So you're scheme is a massive: FAIL. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Hmm </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> How much testing they do back in April?Covid19. Healthdata .org (official stats, comprehensive graphs, daily deaths vs cases vs tests). These narratives focused on cases arent telling the whole story. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Covid kills obese people most of America is fat / obese . Hmmm I wonder if China saw a weakness... </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Trump says suck it up and make him money </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Looking like most missed the point. Why non news reporters ever asked Trump this obvious question that Why non of the the people around Trump and Trump himself never got infected not only that they are without PPE but also in contact with the masses? Isn't that's an example Trump has been telling the world that this virus is not that scary for most people? Or isn't because the hydroxychlorquine that Trump told the world he had taken?  Just wondering.... </COMMENT 6>

<COMMENT 9> LMAO after all the protest, looting, destruction of small businesses, vandalism of national monuments the Democratic party voted not to change anything about policing. That's right folks all the left wing liberal idiots got played by their own representatives. The Democratic party patronized the black community by buying and wearing an African scarf and kneeling on camera. That's all you got from the Democratic party that control the cities where all the violence is happening. Also don't forget to thank the Marxist leaders of the black lives matter movement for getting you to go out in the streets in the middle of a pandemic to catch the corona virus. They are trying to overthrow the US government to implement socialism and using black people as pons knowing they really don't care about the black community. </COMMENT 9>

It boggles my mind that people think this. This is a public health crisis. Once you get it then you'll wish people around you wore masks. America is selfish and greedy and that is going to doom us all. Hey you like money America? Well you need people ALIVE so you can make more money.

Which means they‚Äôre intentionally cross contaminating everyone. They‚Äôre putting patients on ventilators needlessly, and giving them LETHAL DOSES of morphine. The elderly are pretty much left to die. Nurses are under gagging orders not to speak up. I know this TRULY AS A SAD FACT. Wonder why they needed to spend on a marketing campaign for thanking the NHS? Is it because people would start calling them murderers? The govt need more deaths to justify their actions, as they‚Äôve invested TRILLIONS of ¬£ of our tax payers money into this 5g BS! Now they‚Äôre saying EVERYONE needs a flu jab to ease the burden on the NHS for the next wave of deaths. I wonder if this flu jab will come up positive on their flawed covid test?? I truly feel for the deceased, and many died needlessly, and many died without covid but had it put on their death certificate. We're rapidly losing our human rights of which our soldiers gave their lives for in the world wars......for a flu virus??? Really???? F them and their BS!!! I work with the public, handle lots of cash, go from place to place and DONT SANITIZE OR WEAR A MASK. I'm not scared, just pissed off with how we're all getting screwed. Wanna protect urself? Stop sanitising everything eat vitamin rich foods, exercise if poss, and for god's sake dont take a flu jab, u can protect urself naturally especially the elders in ur family.

<COMMENT 3> FRN has confirmed reports that hackers have successfully hacked accounts
belonging to Bill Gates, the WHO, and a lab in Wuhan believed to be the 
location researching coronavirus that received funding from Dr. Fauci.
The event appears to have taken place on or about April 20th.
¬†¬†¬†¬† Netizens have taken to activism and people are logging in via
SSH and downloading the contents of these hacks. 
¬†¬†¬†¬† This means that many people will be combing through the hacked
documents with a fine-toothed comb..Hackers apparently looking for 
the truth behind the coronavirus outbreak have allegedly hacked the 
World Health Organization, the Wuhan biolab and the Bill and Melinda
Gates Foundation. A set of huge databases containing usernames and 
passwords has been leaked.
¬†¬†¬†¬† Many are speculating that the Gates Foundation is linked to the 
research of ‚Äúgain of function‚Äù. This describes a function where scientists
add deadly features to a virus. It was outlawed in the US back in 2015 by
a moratorium and research was all migrated to Wuhan, whereas FRN
reported, Dr. Fauci funneled nearly $4 million USD to complete his
research.
¬†¬†¬†¬† COVID-19 was ostensibly made in a lab. French Nobel prize winning 
scientist¬†Luc Montagnier¬†is publicly alleging that this is the case. According 
to him, there‚Äôs no possibility of this virus occurring naturally. It has
the ‚Äúinsertion points‚Äù of 3 different viruses. That means it is a chimera of 3

<COMMENT 9> Strzok Notes Reveal Biden Knew About Flynn Probe Despite His Denials
WASHINGTON, DC - SEPTEMBER 04: U.S. Vice President Joe Biden attends a bilateral meeting in the Oval Office between President Barack Obama and King Salman bin Abd alAziz of Saudi Arabia at the White House September 4, 2015 in Washington, D.C. Vice President Joe Biden said Thursday that he "would ‚Ä¶Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty Images

Former Vice President and now 2020 Democrat presidential nominee Joe Biden claimed months ago that he knew ‚Äúnothing‚Äù about moves to investigate former Trump National Security Advisor Lt. Gen. (Ret.) Michael Flynn, but newly-released documents proved otherwise.

Biden, appearing in May on ABC News‚Äô This Week, was asked by news anchor and host George Stephanopoulos what he knew about moves to investigate Flynn while he was vice president.


 

Biden first responded, ‚ÄúI knew nothing about those moves to investigate Michael Flynn.‚Äù

When confronted by Stephanopoulos that he attended a now-famous January 2017 Oval Office meeting with then-President Obama and other top officials where they discussed Flynn, Biden claimed he understood the question to be whether he had anything to do with Flynn‚Äôs prosecution.

Then he said, ‚ÄúI was aware that they had asked for an investigation,‚Äù without specifying who ‚Äúthey‚Äù were.


‚ÄúBut that‚Äôs all I know about it. I don‚Äôt think anyone else ‚Äî look, think about this,‚Äù he said, changing the subject to coronavirus. ‚ÄúThis is all about diverting attention.‚Äù

However, newly-released handwritten notes from former FBI agent Peter Strzok show that not only was Biden aware of President Obama‚Äôs order to investigate Flynn, but he had suggested that Flynn had violated the 1799 Logan Act for speaking to then-Russian Ambassador to the U.S. Sergei Kislyak as incoming national security adviser.

Those phone calls ‚Äî just some of hundreds Flynn had with foreign leaders during the transition period after the election ‚Äî were used as the basis for the Obama administration to continue investigating Flynn and to interview him and get him to admit to violating the Logan Act or to get him to lie and be prosecuted.

Previously released documents showed that the FBI had moved to end its investigation on whether Flynn was a Russian agent until Strzok intervened, based on the calls with Kislyak. That happened right around the time of the Obama Oval Office meeting.



 
Strzok‚Äôs notes were released Wednesday, after an outside prosecutor appointed by Attorney General Bill Barr to look into the FBI‚Äôs handling of the investigation into Flynn, U.S. Attorney Jeff Jensen, found the notes and handed them over to the DOJ.

Flynn‚Äôs defense team, led by lawyer Sidney Powell, then filed a motion for the release of the notes.

The notes also show that Obama had directed the FBI to have the ‚Äúright people‚Äù look into Flynn. They also show that then-FBI Director James Comey said Flynn‚Äôs phone calls with then-Russian Ambassador to the U.S. Sergei Kislyak were ‚Äúlegit.‚Äù

<COMMENT 10> Are you telling me it didn't just disappear like Trump said it would. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Greetings from Austria, testing is important and the US is at 90k per 1 M population that is not the best in the world, but it is not bad. First problem is that the testing took so many months to come up and second that the testing is not the same in all states. E.g. NY seems to have a very good testing system and Florida not.We never had the capacity to test so many people like the US in the beginning, so from the start contact tracing and isolating and testing as many as possible was important. So we did not need as many tests, especially at the start when the resources were not there. 9 million people and "only" around 600 dead we got away quite good.. 
As a European it is not understandable to have a discussion about wearing a mask. Here our health professionals and health minister ordered all people to wear masks in public transport, all stores and any situation where distancing was not possible. E.g. if you were driving with friend in your car who was not living with you needed to wear a mask. it is so easy, it does not hurt, the only thing is it is hot and if you wear classes they fog. If people did not comply they had to pay fines and if refused repeating the fines got higher up to 3000 euros (3376 USD), same for social distancing. The police was ordered not go out and look to collect as many fines as possible, they were very present and talked to people and tried to reason with them or better said they made them a  bad conscience  and told them to distance or put on a mask. Here a pack of 3 cloth masks costs 9 dollars you can wash and  reuse them. Our country is now open. The EU has a big advantage, because we are all individual states, the borders could be closed for some time and thus the spread could be contained internally. Now they are partially open again, even to Italy, which I like to do on weekends, since I only need 3-4 hours to the sea. Entry restrictions apply only to a few states that are not under control of their spread. We survived it well with 9 million inhabitants and "only" around 600 dead. I am really sorry for my relatives in the USA one state manages to bring everything under control and the next one does not because governors believe it is not that serious, as a result you have people travel all over the country and keep spreading the disease. It is really tragic to watch the monkey theater that is going on in the US, on the one hand we are shocked and on the other hand I am sorry we laugh, not about the country or the citizens but about the orange man in the white house, it would be inconceivable in our government types he would have been voted out a long time ago by means of a motion of no confidence, it is much easier than in the USA if you do not abide by the rules you get kicked out. Our last vice chancellor had screwed up and was corrupt, it took 3 days then the government was dissolved and new elections were called. In the meantime (5-6 months) the highest officials in the resorts took over the business and the president vowed a former supreme judge as interim chancellor. The minister posts were filled by experts (many not out of politics some from the private sector, some scholars,...)  and everything went back to normal after about 10 days.  To be honest it was quite comforting to see a government work without fighting. If they wanted to change something they had to ask the parliament, a simple majority vote was enough.It was more an administration, than a government that redesigns. More a finishing of already started projects by the previous administration.
Here, the COVID measures were also not a question of politics, and which party or party is involved everyone was able to act quickly and quickly, and discussions can be enough during and afterwards. For example, now the discussion about which measures best stimulate the economy is a question of the party, the greens want to invest in more new green jobs and public transport, the conservatives want to make it easy for businesses, the social democrats want to strengthen the purchasing power of citizens, the right-wing want to build up emigration restrictions (to prevent theft of the job) and above all to build up the prerequisite of our language for economic refugees, ... now they are discussing to find a compromise. As always, it will be a mixture of a little bit of everything. our government is currently a 70% conservative and 30% green government and the opposition is the right (trump like xenophobes had 11% at the last election), the social democrats (workers' party), new liberals. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> The Republican Party is infested with enablers, liars and now murderers as a result of the former... </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> No worries, they will keep denying whilst the body pile up. Until half the state is dead they will claim it is not as bad. </COMMENT 13>

<COMMENT 9> Good  opportunity  to  bring  in   new  protocols for tourism ......treat  your  travel  and  destinations  with  respect  for  all   ...  as  though  it  were   'your own home'  !!  :)  ;) </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Love his style! </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> It's incredible that anyone is interested in tourism except for people who have financial interests in tourist destinations. When I think of traveling it's when everything is going well in my life, I'm healthy and have money in the bank. Even the people who live at tourist destinations are worried about people bringing new cases of infection despite working directly or in businesses that support the tourist industry. Please, if you must travel, now is a great time to discover your local history and attractions. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> My view is that not only tourism but society as a whole should rethink how to be prepared if another worldwide calamity will strike in the future.
My mom still makes preserves at home and by buying little things, we would have been able to eat at the same rate as before end of January for at least 8 months. She taught me how to make pizzas, bread and some types of pasta. We have access to FREE spring water nearby. We make our own olive oil and wine.
We also do NOT gamble with money and buy what we really need; albeit I still need to convince my teen daughter to consider a similar approach too.
The biggest problems i see with this pandemic are two: 1. Many people, companies, and countries have little if no RESERVES at all; 2. Probably many of the same people are so reckless because they cannot control their urges.
I hope this pandemic and associated economic downturn will go away soon. But in the UNFORTUNATE one or both of them stick with us, my family was well prepared well before all of this struck! </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> DW#1 The best. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> By inhaling the vapors of eucalyptus leaves or oil for 'COVID-19' can decrease the 'DEATH RATE' by improving the respiratory system.
(we can save many lives)
Eucalyptus is also very helpful to avoiding other symtoms of 'COVID-19'.
Please it is request test it. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> For those uncomfortable with the pandemic still unresolved, remain sitting the outdoor activities out for the meantime then but for those who dare to brave that, just stay safe and mind the distance and sanitation. Tourism took a beating and that industry needs all the help it could get. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> I will start my Europe tour from Italy...I don't care about this virus may be after a year.... </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> The definition of suffering is having A-bomb put on your head and nowhere to go.. Yemen?
the definition of suffering is somebody has shot you and nobody's helping you... or you've been raped and no one believes you and you have offspring in your belly that you can't get on abortion , blocked. suffered economic woes not quite the same </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> CAN hotels really sanitize and disinfect their premises and rooms perfectly? I don't think so. Many are cutting corners and reuse used linens etc. </COMMENT 18>

<COMMENT 20> The only people coming back to Australia are Australians. And our cases are still minimal. This lady isn't mentioning one important factor. Countries with Universal Healthcare are fairing better. Flattening the curve was never meant to be absolute zero. People die from the the flu. Is there a campaign to eradicate the flu to absolute zero cases of infection or death? She's clearly showing her political bias and trying to make the virus sound worse than it actually is. Our measure of success should be manageable numbers, not zero cases of infection or death. Which is what this whole second wave narrative is pushing. That we need to eradicate this virus to open the economy. We can't. It's here to stay, just like Influenza. People need to learn to adjust to that fact. Yes it is more deadly than Influenza but the mortality rate is still low. Absolutely zero cases of infection or death should not be and never really was the goal. That's a false narrative pushed by the left. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 1> When will this coronaphobia end . Everyone is over it people are dying more of stress and suicides due to this BS. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> And I believe a second wave will hit N.S.W. Also  - I hope I‚Äôm wrong . </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> International travellers including Australian Returnees escaping from the countries they chose to serve and irresponsible protesters who are encouraging to defy social distancing are responsible for spreading the virus. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Shut off the footy till it's zero cases.. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Of course it's the left labour party not only in shambles over it's corruption and branch stacking, but now it's making the public pay the price for it's moronic "let black lives matter protest" policy as evidenced by the new spread of the chinavirus.... Don't ever vote for these idiots again. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Get the Americans to do a tactical nuke on vic and in 100 years everyone else can just move on in....problem solved </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Triage, Victoria is done. Build a wall around it and turn off the power and pretend it doesn‚Äôt exist.  Apparently the name invites racism anyway... let‚Äôs lose Victoria </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Credit to this channel allowing comments! Wake up Australia, 77 , 110 active cases, come on, its a scam and a distraction from the criminal actions of Dani Daniel Andrews! Why isn't he being invested and charged ! </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> CoronaKing Dan </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> It's trying to shut the stable door after the horse has bolted. This is the result of allowing protests to go ahead. It will also be interesting to get the ages of the people getting the current crop of infections. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Don't you need a "first wave" before you have a "second wave"? </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Mr Andrews gets blasted for closing too early. Then he gets blasted for opening too early. you can't win against the Murdoch LNP media. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Good on you Dan for letting thousands protest but blame families at home.  Good one. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> More protests! BLM .
Well done Melbourne thanks for fucking it up for the rest of us.
Large family gatherings? yeaaaah right ok, 100% nothing to do with the BLM virtue "protests" </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> What total nonsense. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Well thats what happens when you let 10000 people go and protest for something that does NOT concern us,  so for all those you did protest - well fucken done.... </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> This isn't a Victorian issue it's a Melbourne issue. Start giving local governments the power to enact their own restrictions as required. It's stupid that businesses and lives in rural areas are going to continue to be crippled because Melbourne has problems. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> BLM and climate change protesters are killing theirs friends and theirs families  by spreading the virus . They will live with this for the rest of theirs life . Theses protesters from H&M store are you guys happy now ? Any of you regrets that you spreading virus to your loved ones. </COMMENT 18>

La v√©rit√© est tout autre: le nombre de d√©c√®s du 11 mai au 22 juin s'√©l√®ve √† 3020 en France alors qu'il est de 1308 en Allemagne et de 24 seulement en Cor√©e du Sud respectivement.

D‚Äôun point de vue plus large je veux bien comprendre que cette crise a un impact consid√©rable sur l‚Äô√©conomie, mais l‚Äô√©tat reste totalement flou et contradictoire envers nous, c‚Äôest extr√™mement bizarre. Soyons prudents et prot√©geons nous </COMMENT 9>

<COMMENT 1> Millions of virus spreading communust protestors will do that </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> The Global Population living in Western countries have been taught for more than a generation to live in a Constant State of Fear ever since 9/11. We have been encouraged to sacrifice our Liberty for a false sense of security, being conditioned more and more each day to rely on the State for protection, and now many of us find ourselves relying on the State to pay our bills and to Lock Us Down! </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Does anyone bring God into this? The coronavirus is a warning to the nations of the world that the dispensation of grace is over and¬†the dispensation of the Anti-Christ is about to begin. Millions of people will soon disappear from the face of the Earth " in a twinkling of an eye." as the Bible says. This is the time to repent of your sins and invite Jesus into your life. He is coming back for those who gave their heart to Him and stay away from any kind of sin. This is what you can say: Mighty Jesus, I repent of all of my sins and I ask You to come into my heart. Be my Lord, my God and my Savior. Please give me Your Holy Spirit and establish holiness and righteousness within me. Please take me to heaven when you come for your children. In Jesus's name I pray. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Yet you said nothing to warn the rioters, you supported it. And now they are sickened. End Democratic slavery in America people, vote Republican. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> WHO is corrupt organization and its leader was a politician for a radical extremist communist party. He later has worked for a foundation of Bill Gates in a leading position before he was appointed to become the president of WHO. They are all closely connected to Bill Gates, the pharmaceutical industry and are the mouthpiece of Bill Gates, who has created a very powerful and influential monopoly in the global pharmaceutical industry. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Good thing theres next to a 100% chance you'll be fine when you get it. The lockdowns did nothing. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Who cares about CASES?! There's increased TESTING. Hospital admissions, ICU admissions and deaths are the only stats that matter. Deaths are going down, even in Florida. https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/usa/florida/ </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> A "case" is NOT a "hospitalization".  Only one out of a hundred cases turns into a hospitalization.  That's why increasing cases are a good thing.  It tells us we're reaching herd immunity where infected people are not sick enough to report to a doctor. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> ‚ÄúWestern countries governments, like America, should be on top of reopening‚Äù? Are you kidding? This administration is talking about slowing down testing to slow the numbers reported! We are in deep! </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Cuz more testing </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> I don't think the human population is caring anymore ...... </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> so the world was waiting for the largest single day increase in new cases to REMOVE the only preventative measures (social distancing) KNOWN to be effective in REDUCING the number of new covid cases? that's like the U.S. meteorological service issuing an evacuation only AFTER a category 5 hurricane makes landfall in miami.  HUH!?!?! </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> And the second wave hasn't started yet. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Maybe we should just stay in lockdown forever? Why bother opening up anything if cases keep appearing? Let's face it. Life is over. Good luck. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> WHO cares. FAKE FAKE FAKE </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Who‚Äôs who? What? That corrupted org still around ? Cheewee </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Did they mention a one day total record of test provided?  More test equals more cases.   No one mentions the death rates anymore ü§îü§î. 99.6% recovery rates currently </COMMENT 17>

<COMMENT 9> ‚ÄúNewspapers are the second hand [of the clock] of history. This hand, however, is usually not only of inferior metal to the other two hands, it also seldom works properly. The so-called ‚Äúleading articles" in them are the chorus to the drama of current events. Exaggeration in every sense is as essential to newspaper writing as it is to the writing of plays; for the point is to make as much as possible of every occurrence. So that all newspaper writers are, for the sake of their trade, alarmists: this is their way of making themselves interesting. What they really do, however, is resemble little dogs who, as soon as anything whatever moves, start up a loud barking.

It is necessary, therefore, not to pay too much attention to their alarms, and to realize in general that the newspaper is a magnifying glass, and this only at best: for very often it is no more than a shadow-play on a wall.‚Äù

Truth 99% RECOVERY rate.  these people are so desperate to keep the lie going.  There pulling for straws.. God is allowing this moment to unmask these workers of iniquity. So called experts and media liars.. God is allowing this moment to unmask their true agenda which has nothing to do with elf and everything to do with social conditioning and masking people and their satanic initiation. They are being used by the devil to lead people to the mark of the beast. Turn to Jesus Christ people getting your Bibles. to know Jesus Christ is victorious King over death is to not live in fear of death so their propaganda using the fear of  death will not work on you. 

most in media and many left us politicians and people in government are hellbound. Don't be a blind man following a blind man into the ditch. 

turn to Jesus Christ to get spiritually woke and set free.

<COMMENT 16> Oh yeah blame it on them on ope ing up early.  We all told those "experts" that locking everything down would do the opposite of what they were saying.  Now that it happens they backwalk their speech and say it is the early reopening.  Quit bullshiting. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Restaurant is a perfect place to get infected. Also, people who are purchasing their meals via takeout from restaurants need to be aware that cooks in commercial kitchens don't care about personal hygiene, one of them might have the virus, sneezing and coughing into your food and then wrapping it up and sending it to you. A perfect way to get infected. </COMMENT 17>

<COMMENT 2> Superb </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Looks like fun </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> While the nasal swab wasn't totally unpleasant for me I would like to know if there are more accurate tests that DON'T involve jamming something up my nose.
10/10 for the test subject. This carps all over that Mount Sinai video. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Awesome step-by-step explanation. Thanks. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Thank you to the person getting the swab. Very informative seeing an actual person getting tested. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> My friend liked the black t-shirt of that guy who took the swab in this video. Any idea where i can find one like that? </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> how come the one taking the swab is not properly wearing  PPE especially wearing mask for protection? Gloves is not enough to protect you during swab </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> I‚Äôm scared if I have the Coronavirus, I‚Äôm showing symptoms..but this makes me feel better knowing it‚Äôs not as bad as I thought. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Thank you sooo much. There's so many awful and just plain wrong demos out here. For example i just can't believe how terrible the video on this released by Mount Sinai is. Scary </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> 5-6 cm is not deep enough to get to the  nasopharynx. And it's easier to make sure you're passing along the floor of the nose if head is tilted forward about 5 degrees, which lines  it up with the horizontal plane. Leaning head back makes it more likely you'll go up and over the inferior turbinate and hit the middle turbinate or face of the sphenoid sinus instead of getting to the nasopharynx. Both of these can be injured and would be very painful to hit with the swab. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Thanks for the demonstration. why swab on the wall of the pharynx only, what about the tonsil pillars </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Who came from a Reddit post? </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> It was my understanding that you needed to swab both sides. Can you please clarify </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Great job </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> great! </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> üëçüëçüëç </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Oropharyngeal swab shouldn't be placed in the sample collection tube?? I don't understand
(Last sentence in the video) </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> This appears to be the best way to collect sample and exactly why I doubt the public at large will  be able to perform this on a home test.  The average Joe and Jolene will NOT insert that swab that deeply into their own nose and then the results will likely be inaccurate. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> I have no experience collecting these samples, but I know the anatomy, having done nasolacrimal duct surgery. This demonstration appears to correctly show the route to the nasopharynx. I can only guess that the layman, seeing the nose from the outside, thinks the only logical route into the nose goes parallel to the externally visible bridge of the nose. So far, the other demonstrations I have seen show the swab aiming upward toward the cribriform plate area. I suspect that the many presumed false negatives that ER and ICU doctors have seen are due to this sampling error, though a study comparing the prevalence of Covid-19 in these various locations within the nasal cavity might prove me right or wrong. The only fault I see in this video is the statement that two inches is the distance the swab is advanced to reach the nasopharynx, while it clearly looks much farther (from the entry to the nose) than that. I fear if a neophyte follows that guideline, he will be sampling only the inferior nasal turbinate. But good work otherwise. I welcome any correction to my impression. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 1> When asked about treatments; I'm surprised Gottlieb doesn't mention Leronlimab???  Leronlimab is in line for approval for COVID-19 within the next 3 weeks, so it's very odd  for Gottlieb to not make mention of Leronlimab; when asked about treatments.   They completed their double blinded phase 3 trials 10 days ago for severe/critical and mild/moderate and the FDA is reviewing their data.   If their data is stronger than Remdesivir's; which is a low bar; then they should be approved for COVID-19 and they should become the drug of choice for treatment.  Gottlieb knows this but doesn't mention them?   He knows they are a good 3 or 4 months ahead of Regeneron's antibody cocktail, so he should tell the public and give his opinion on the drug.   CytoDyn's stock has risen from $1 up to $5 since February in hopes of Leronlimab approval. </COMMENT 1>

Why you‚Äôre wearing a mask the pagan ritual of transformation
May 7, 2020 by Rayfields
the pagan ritual of transformation

The pagan ritual of transformation Julian Huxley once wrote that the basic elements in cultural transmission and transformation are psychological. This is how we change. Since time immemorial, high rituals have been performed to transform reality.

Ritual is a spiritual psycho-drama of consciousness; a deliberate action taken to facilitate change; changes to the whole of the environment people exist in, starting with the mental landscape of the people themselves; ‚Äúthe place where our reality exists is first born in a dream.‚Äù

Artist Sharon Devlin once bluntly described the true purpose of ritual as being a:

‚Äú‚Ä¶ method to alter one‚Äôs mind. It‚Äôs a sacred drama in which you are the audience as well as the participant. And the purpose of it is to activate parts of the mind that are not activated by everyday activity.‚Äù

Ritual facilitates the mechanics of change through specific mechanisms; a rhythm to sync to; to merge and flow with; a magnetic draw, drawing one on the path toward transmutation.

Rituals are vehicles driving home those ideas; the information, the data, the symbols which upon transmission create the language by which new society members communicate after they are initiated.

This new language imparts a new understanding through definitions that the ritual generates.

A ritual initiation introduces and inducts one into ‚Äúthe way‚Äù; a new way of life or world view; a program to guide beliefs and actions, enabling the initiate to become a full and true member of the new society.

Note that ritual isn‚Äôt always a conscious action. Not everyone partaking in a ritual is made explicitly aware that they are participants. And yet, still, new patterns of thoughts, of significance, are drummed in; conscious or not of the ritual in which the initiate is partaking.

the pagan ritual of transformation The three stages of an initiation ritual
An initiation ritual typically involves three stages.

Let‚Äôs see if any of this sounds familiar to you.

The first stage is isolation for purification.

In this stage, the initiate is separated from the mundane. Did you know that mundane literally means ‚Äúof the world?‚Äù

The initiate is largely removed from the otherwise familiar persons, places and things that they‚Äôre used to in order to be ‚Äúcleared‚Äù of them.

An initiate is forced to become detached and insulated, purged and ‚Äúpurified.‚Äù

An essential element of this separation from one‚Äôs typical environment is the suspension of the normal rules of living that one is used to; the normal way.

Most of the initiate‚Äôs senses will become commanded and regulated at this time. In other words, the majority of what the initiate sees, hears, smells, touches and tastes, is deliberately controlled.

In the ritual, these senses may be bombarded, modified, limited or deprived. But, regardless, perceptions and experiences are ultimately overseen by the high priest and priestesses directing the ritual‚Äôs performance.

The ritual enables new light to shine through a newly opened window of thoughts.

With nowhere else to go except the places that we‚Äôre ‚Äúallowed,‚Äù the insulated, isolated, initiated may be forced to confront his or her own reflection and inner shadows that have been ignored or buried somewhere deep beneath the average day-to-day.

These things suddenly become unavoidable.

Triggers are detonated; another purge.

Just as they involve surrender, initiation rituals also involve sacrifice; both the tangible that can be held in the hand, and the intangible, such as behaviors, must be given up by requirement.

After all, for something to be ‚Äúgiven,‚Äù something must also be taken; a token of submission, an ounce of blood; a pound of clay to be remolded.

Whether dramatically overt or deceitfully subtle, the ritual reinterprets reality; a new definition of reality is given. Training in the form of new behaviors and knowledge, including myths and codes are introduced.

Things necessary for new members to function properly in the society they‚Äôre being inducted into are all imbued during this time.

Repetition is typical, as its use helps hammer home the spell on the initiates.

The wearing of masks for the initiates
The wearing of masks during an initiation ritual is almost always required. Masking has traditionally played an important role in the rituals of these kinds.

Why you‚Äôre wearing a mask the pagan ritual of transformation
Masks hasten the suppression of ego to help facilitate the death of the old identity before the identification with, and the manifestation of, a new identity.

WHY DO THEY KEEP WARNING ABOUT A ‚ÄúSECOND WAVE‚Äù OF COVID-19?
Disguised under a mask and hidden away, the initiate is more easily able to transcend the self; pushed forward toward that invisible line between the physical and spiritual realms.

Trauma
Trauma is yet another key aspect of this kind of initiation ceremony. It‚Äôs used mostly to personalize the fear of death.

Sometimes in the ritual, the act of dying is ceremonially role played; the dark beyond the darkness; the yawning abyss.

Only after death is confronted can the initiated by symbolically resurrected and reborn anew.

While the process that is playing out is quite coordinated and sophisticated in reality, it may be executed in a purposefully confusing manner; so that the goalposts seem to keep moving back and forth, up and down, here now there immediately after.

This renders the initiate unable to find solid mental ground from which to make logical sense of anything.

This disorientation is key in the transformation ritual.

The uncertain timing generates a general anxiety, further removing the initiate from reality while leaving him or her more susceptible to a type of pavlovian conditioning.

This weakens the defenses just as a virus would. Only this has the potential to break down the individual much more completely than a virus.

Whatever the finer details, the previous way of life is shed like an old skin at the end of the ritual; an end that comes before the new beginning.

The change begins.

The transition
This is the second phase; the transition. As the old self symbolically dies and passes away, the initiate descends into a state of liminality; a sort of fever-dream purgatory-nowhere land; the void in the middle.

Thus, the old self dies as the initiate is purified. The initiate is now a white room; a blank canvass washed, primed and desperate for paint; a tabula rasa.

At the same time his old existence and way of life dies, the initiate transcending it is gradually being processed, reprogrammed and incorporated into his new environment; reformed, reconstituted and rebirthed into the new world that awaits at the end of the tunnel.

The integration
At some point in the future, we will see the final phase of the transformation ritual; integration.

Does any of what‚Äôs been described in this article sound familiar to you?

The only question that remains is: do you consent?

<COMMENT 2> STOP consulting and testing and open up - this is getting beyond ridiculous   PEOPLE all know it to from specialists and doctors that this is all uncalled for. </COMMENT 2>

<COMMENT 4> Desjardins has actually been supporting clients through auto premium relief measures since the beginning of the pandemic... Not sure who he's hearing this from: https://www.desjardinsagents.com/covid-19-en </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Hi Doug Ford I would like to be apart of the broadcast but I can‚Äôt watch on tv because I am legally blind can I please have some help </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Ford is standing there saying the farmers aren't getting the workers tested, like he has no say in the matter?  I thought it was already taken care of when Trudeau said farmers were getting extra money to make changes to keep the workers safe. Where did the money go?  I've seen videos of cramped quarters, heard they aren't being fed properly and PPE isn't always there. That one farm that had 200 or so workers with COVID should be shutdown. It's obviously the farmers who are at fault and NOW they are going to step up inspections?  If Mexico did stop more from coming here we'd be in a crisis because you couldn't pay anyone here to take those low paying jobs, especially with a pandemic looming. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> What the do you mean "everyone" is cooperating? Wake the hell up and quit ignoring what is right in front of your face! People ARE NOT cooperating. Come downtown, go to the parks, go to the beach, get on the transit...NO social distancing - NO masks!!! Also quit ignoring the World Health Organization's dire warning that a second wave has started earlier than predicted and today was a the HIGHEST RECORD of positive cases worldwide since this thing started. You sold out and your phony concern is no longer working Mr. Politician! </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> I saw the video of the police killing that elderly. They acted like they were taking down a serial killer or the perpetrators of some other heinous crime spree. These officers have no concept of what Deescalation is, much less what it entails. They should not have been there in the first place. That is why we need to defund the police (reduce their budget - that's what it means) and invest that money in community based services and/or an agency/department with qualified people who are trained in mental health issues and deescalation protocols. We need to help these people, not have the police execute them. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> It is really a crock that the city of Windsor is still stuck in stage 1.  The migrant workers should be made to be tested, period. It should be part of their job requirement. This pandemic has been so devasting for so many people! Enough is enough. It's really ridiculous that the farmers aren't being held more accountable for their workers TO BE tested. It needs to be done, so DO it!  Windsor/Essex should be moving to phase 2!!!!!! </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> I said a couple of weeks ago that I doubt the farmers were going to do what it takes to keep the workers healthy. I was hoping I was wrong. </COMMENT 10>

They have been wrong every step of the way. What a scam this whole thing has been. All politicians are parisites on society. </COMMENT 14>

<COMMENT 18> For the first time the TRENDLines Research model is forecasting over 1 million Covid deaths - 200 more in Ontario & 700 more in Canada. This weekend's update indicates ultimate 2020 fatalities resulting from Covid-19 novel coronavirus will be: 1.145 million global deaths (present toll 465K + 780K future); 145,000 in the USA (present toll 121K + 24K future); 46,800 in the UK (present toll 42,800 + 4,000 future); 9,000 in Canada (present toll 8,300 + 700 future); 2,810 in Ontario (present toll 2,610 + 200 future); & 170 victims in BC (present toll 168 + 2 future).

New post-peak lows for daily-deaths were set this week in the USA, UK, Canada & Ontario. BC had only a single victim in the past fourteen days. But relaxed restrictions wrt lock-downs, physical distancing & masking has vaulted worldwide daily-deaths to 5,700 - up 114% over the post-peak low set four weeks ago.

TRENDLines Research's post-peak linearization model chart & underlying stats are updated twice weekly at www.trendlines.ca </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> I honestly don‚Äôt see this working?   Where is the second wave theory coming from, was there even a first wave?  The Spanish flu was compared when death rate was 30%, Covid 19 under 1% and 80% over 80 years old?  üßê </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 2> Boring. Who cares anymore. The whole episode has been a total economic and social disaster that has promoted division and finger pointing at every opportunity.
The media has had a field day as no one has been able to mix for months so allowing them to spew their lies unchallenged.
The world is a worse more hate filled place than ever.
Get ready for the tax rises, pension cuts, and oppression of the working and middle classes.

<COMMENT 6> Let me clear this up its 1M+. Im other words if U can do 1m you have to do it, but if U cant then U can use 1m, but it doesn't mean tha if U can do 2m U have to readjust to 1m??? they should just scrap social distancing as no1s sticking to it anyways, same with lockdown, as if we're not told to do something we're more likely to do it as it's not forced on each other or leaving every1 confused what to do all the time. </COMMENT 6>

<COMMENT 13> [Q 16:112] The Almighty Creator cites the example of a Community that used to be Secure and Prosperous, with Provisions coming to it from all over the world. But then, it turned Unappreciative of the Almighty's Blessings. Consequently, the Almighty Creator caused them to Taste the Hardships of Starvation and Insecurity. Such is the requital for what they did. [Q 16:113] A Messenger had gone to them from among them, but they Rejected him. Consequently, the Retribution Struck them for their Transgression.
Ever since 46 years ago the Almighty Creator has been sending us His awesome Miracles in the Arabic Quran through one of American Scientist based on number 19 with the help of computer so far in 1500 pages of scientific reports based on pure Mathematics, the Exact Science. You must know that the Arabic Quran does not have anything to do with so called Islam or Muslims.
The reason news media are not allowed to talk about this news of the millennium is because of the US government agenda on "Washington Prayer Breakfast" sponsored by "The Family" an extremist Christian religious Cult, which started 80 years ago and all the US presidents were the member of "The Family". We have now the scientifically proven evidence based on mathematics, the exact science to prove these facts in the Court of Law. </COMMENT 13>

<COMMENT 18> Surgeon General just said masks promote freedom. Nice try. Its like when the Nazis told the jews, "work sets you free." WE can rejoice Lockup is Over. Life is for the living. Hypochondriacs &Germophobes have immune systems. The economy is in tatters and Civil liberties have been bulldozed and trampled like a stampede on the 4th of July. I'm sure  Dr Fauci is just about wrapping up the final chapters of book Health horrors. RattleNews will have you ramped for decades. For all those who love lockdown. I think there's a deep dark cave with your name on it, go crawl inside and get nice and cozy we'll call you when its safe to come out. Like Never. Mainstream media lives for whipping the gullible public into a frenzied state of paranoid panic, always make sure the masses scared witless, manipulate the "news". Keep the Fear level Def-con 2  We're going to hear a plethora of news and misinformation for the next decade. Most "scientific" studies are coming from communist China, a master manipulator spewing propaganda measured to fit. What you, as a free thinking individual capable of rational decision making skills, must decide is whats fact and whats fiction. Fact: My life is far more in danger biking or driving, with less than a .0002% chance in dying from Sars-cov 2. I'll take my chances. Freedom isnt optional! </COMMENT 18>

<COMMENT 5> This is for anyone wearing masks for daily use. The proper ratio of Carbon dioxide (CO2) production to Oxygen (O2) consumption in the (RQ) respiratory quotient   is between 0.7 and 1.0  for proper cellular metabolic activity and function.  The use of a mask  under regular daily activities and conditions has shown to severely  restrict O2 intake (inhaled Oxygen) and increase CO2 uptake (exhaled Carbon Dioxide) by restricting  air flow pathway. In other words face masks decrease oxygen intake and yet increase  toxic CO2  from re breathing a significant proportion of the exhaled gas trapped in the mask. The first line of deference within the our bodies immune  Lymphocyte system  from any microbial pathogenic  invaders is drastically inhibited from any imbalance of the (RQ) respiratory quotient, producing the exact opposite effect of what is intended from the use of masks. This is so elementary  and commonsensical  that it shouldn't  need any explanation. Stop wearing masks !! </COMMENT 5>

<COMMENT 1> Well they are all Christians there. So i would say let Almighty God, do his thing, LoL...! I hope they don't think he's Unjust...! </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> We are still waiting for the first wave  to be honest.
That is also the reason, why German hospitals are able to treat ICU patients from Italy, Spain, France and Austria for months now. 
Ventilators were sent to UK in March and April.
Germany didn`t experienced a true wave. Since the outbreak / initial spread in Germany (caused by ski tourist from Ischgl, a Chinese employee with parents in Wuhan from webasto in Munich and a tourist couple coming home from Italy), there have been just hot spots (church services, elderly care homes, meat production and the very first event: carnival in Heinsberg) to be extinguished.
Actually, I do not know anybody with covid19 or somebody, who knows an infected local person (aside of the French ICU patients in our local hospitals).
Thus, it is tough to stay patient. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> China, please take the second wave more seriously, we don't want your virus disturbing our lives </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> So Merkel aka Hitlers daughter is starting to put her plan of world control into place. Wouldn't be surprised if the virus is not from China but really Germany. </COMMENT 4>

<COMMENT 14> i understand the whole people need to work idea, but it could have been differently. Different shifts for different people each day, online work or stay at home offices. Do data entry from the home. Mandatory masks and distancing policies, reataurants open only to half capacity instead of 75% and no bars or clubs open. Alcohol makes people stupid. For sure though the state could have created makeshift hospitals and clinics who could handle cases and divert them to keep room in the hospitals. </COMMENT 14>

There is no abundance of beds.

<COMMENT 16> Ozone therapy and Plasma therapy

Dr Amato De Monte director of the anesthesia and resuscitation department of the University health compagny of Udine treated 36 covid-19 patients in Italy
 with ozone therapy. 
All patients had pneumonia with respiratory difficulty and were doing oxygen terapy with a cap or helmet.

All patients improve after 3-5 ozone therapy sessions.

Many patients were discharged from the hospital and the only patient who was subsequently intubated was extubated.

You don't have to wait for the patient to be intubated but you have to start treatment in the early stages.

After the first cases treated by Amato De Monte, a clinical trial began in various italian hospitals with ozone therapy.

The results have been excellent, they can be read on the website www.ossigenoozonoterapia.it or you can write to info@ossigenoozono.it

Dr Giuseppe De Donno head of the pneumology department Carlo Poma of Mantua in Italy has obtained excellent results with plasma therapy.

He also treated a pregnant woman with plasma therapy, he was the first in the world. </COMMENT 16>

<COMMENT 15> PCR testing for Dummies. 
does not explain the science. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> FACTS ABOUT THE PCR TEST:
Kary Mullis, Inventor of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR test used for detecting CV-19). Regarding the PCR test Mullis said "The test can detect genetic sequences of virus, but not viruses themselves."
- These major Research papers (Zhou, Kim, Poutanen, Drosten, Ksiazek, Peiris) indicate that CV-19 has never been ISOLATED, PURIFIED or VISUALIZED. How then, can anyone say who does or doesn't have the virus?
-   Because COVID-19 has not been ISOLATED, PURIFIED OR VISUALIZED what's the point of taking a RT-PCR test or an antibody test?
-  The RT-PCR test can't look for a virus that's never been ISOLATED. It can only look for something that is associated with what people consider "viral activity." Why isn't Mainstream Media reporting on this? </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> I just got a covid test today and it honestly hurts like hell </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Actually it only tests for ‚ÄúCoronavirus ‚Äú , not for a specific kind that was first purified and tested using Koch‚Äôs postulates. This video is either ignorance by the makers or designed to support the covid-19 narrative which has been designed to put fear and acquiescence into the human population, a huge step in taking control over the 99 percent by the top 1. This is actually happening and everyone needs to consider it and find out the truth for themselves. This is completely necessary for establishing peace on this earth. Our bodies are not who we are. Our color our ‚Äúrace‚Äù is an experience, in Consciousness Itself. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> WAHT THE actual - </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> It‚Äôs not even designed to be a test for an infectious disease ! It‚Äôs a test for genetic material not a virus.  The tests are riddled with false positives and negatives , further the virus has never been purified so how on earth do you know what you are testing for ? This is the biggest medical scam in history and yet people blindly go about believing what they are hearing without doing any basic research. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 2> This guy is a quack!
Here's why

Coronavirus was the biggest medical hoax in history!
R0= .4 to .7
Fomite window = low
Exosomes = primarily false positives.
Asymptomatic = 50% (the vast majority who were symptomatic felt like they had a cold)
Mortality rate = under 1%

They had all these numbers but continued to push Covid-19 lockdown. </COMMENT 2>

Car's, yelling, music from car's settled eating fast food will the car is left on gas in the air, smoke. I want to keep home got to walk though all that to get food on my table. Car's are for people that working or living on farm's. why set at fast food with 20 people touring your food by adding where did it come from? How did it get here? Part only the food knows we will not know. </COMMENT 11>

<COMMENT 2> This guy is just the dumbest..... maybe he doesn't listen to himself </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> COVID 19 cases are on the rise only because of the criminal protests!!! </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Slowing the rise of infection is important or else it will be much like the Black Plague in a few years or decades as Millennials (born 1981-97), Generation Z (born 1998-2010), and the burgeoning Generation Alpha (born 2011-25) will meet the same fate of The Greatest Generation (born 1901-27), The Silent Generation (born 1928-45), Baby Boomers (born 1946-64), Generation X (born 1965-80) that are dying now. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Trump is incompetent and unstable </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Well it is a lot easier for people to self-isolate in New York back in March/April/May when it was cold/dreary/ even had some wet snow at times- then it is in Florida/South Carolina when the TEMP has been constantly over 90 degrees farenhite since March and believe it or not not everything has air conditioning or a back yard pool- so going to the beach or community pool is the way many people have had to cool down and not go crazy during this Pandemic & many people were exposed at work in restaurants/in hospitals/nursing homes and so on as well and no one is mentioning of course the PROTESTS/LOOTING/BEACH PARTIES/BACK YARD BARBECUE WITH MULTIPLE FRIENDS/FAMILIES OVER- if they didn't happen I am sure we would have a lot less cases as would if Governors chose to LOCK THE NURSING HOME DOWN FROM VISITORS AND FROM EMPLOYEES WORKING AT MULTIPLE SITES.


¬† At the end of the day we cannot be locked in and shut down forever- people have bills to pay and many of us need to work to maintain our insurance or are looking for new work. Currently, I have temporarily lost my job due to COVID, and I am home and on government support which I have never used in my life- I am looking at working from home- I don't feel safe working with kids anymore, I choose by my choice to self-isolate/social distance during this time and I haven chosen to not to eat out or take takeout as well, I choose to wear masks/gloves when I go grocery shopping, I choose to watch MASS/Prayer Online then step physically inside of a Church. Cuomo would get my respect maybe if he was running and not dementia BIDEN. The Governors&Mayors have authority on this not Trump- Trump actually considered a national travel on NY/NJ at the height of the outbreak there and guess what they refused it. I am not voting Democratic because all Democratic cities are dumps/full of crime/full of people addicted to social assistance/full of illegals and as a LEGAL immigrant I find that offensive- I have worked for many years, paid into a pension plan, paid for insurance even out of pocket for things not covered for it, all I have known is work and my parents were born into poverty themselves and I am an immigrant and I know what it is like to face discrimination/ethnocentrism because of it and what it means to face sexism in my professional life even though I work in a women dominated field- sometimes it is the women in power who keep women in their place/from stepping  a head or getting the courage to leave a career and find something else or go on another path- not the men and nobody seems to talk about this. Why I am choosing to support TRUMP? LEGAL ABORTION OKAY- JUST NO GOVERNMENT SUPPORT OF IT AND PLANNED PARENTHOOD- NO WAY- I AM PRO-life and definitely do not support abortion up to the 40th week of gestation like many Democratic Governors and Joe Biden does. If I have to co-pay to have an ovarian cyst/get endometriosis surgery done  as a female why should a women get to have a free abortion procedure- I think the cyst/pre-cancerous growth is a whole lot more life-threatening then killing an unborn baby because you don't like the timing of the pregnancy, lover boy has left you alone to deal with it, or the fact the gender of your baby is a GIRL. 

¬†
I was born in a Socialist country and I know and understand what Socialism is like, what it leads to and what it causes and I do not want the US to become like Venezuela. I always tell people if your country of birth is so great why are you in the US and why are you voting for politicians who want to turn the US into the country of your birth? Racism, sexism, ethnocentrism, discrimination, bigotry will always take place- why The Earth is not Heaven and people don't know Jesus Christ and if they did they would know Peace, know Salvation and know how to treat&respect each other and the truth is BLM, ANARCHIST/SOCIALIST movement want to destroy Christianity and Christian values from Society. BLM has a Marxist agenda as well. Marxism is like Communism and it is more dangerous then fascism/nationalism is. If you ask someone from Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, Ukraine who was worse Hitler or Stalin most would say STALIN. 


I think before anyone considers voting democratic and supporting BLM- they should read about liberal hedgefund donors like George Soros, the truth about the Clinton foundation, what Marxism is and stands for, what a Socialist state is and looks like, what it is like to live in a Communist country and what communism brings. Most communist/socialist/oligarch nations were a result of manipulated riots/protests/anarchy and they created worse things for the people not better- just look at the Russian Revolution, Industrial Revolution, French Revolution, and the Chinese Revolution(that brought Communism into China). Look at many South/Central American nations as well and drug cartels- look at Venezuela, Columbia, Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Hondurus and so on. Look at what's happening in Somalia/many Arabic&Persian nations as well. Look at the refugee crisis in Europe and how many refugees stay on welfare long term as well and what good have they brought into Western Europe and the crime rates before and after accepting refugees as well. Look at what political correctness&cultural relativism leads to as well. Look at the One world order/free masonry/ the cover ups in the Vatican and how the Vatican is involved with the One World Order as well. If you aren't a Christian study the Bible from the Old Testament to the New Testament and you will see prophecy there as well, study the Early Church Fathers, Study Catholic Theology, Study Pre-Vatican 1 Catholicism&Post-Vatican 2 Catholicism, Study the differences between Catholicism and Protestantism, Study Evangelical Protestant theology and Mainline Protestant theology as well. Study and learn about all non-Christian religions and cults as well. Try to get news from a non-liberal source and an independent source as well. Stop being manipulated, influenced by CELEBRITIES, HOLLYWOOD, POLITICALLY CORRECT LEMMING FRIENDS. </COMMENT 6>

<COMMENT 10> America wants president who cares more about saving lives than being re-elected If Trump follows through with this,he will have blood on his hands as the murder he has become .The whole point of testing is to  save lives  by getting people that are infected treated  as soon as possible,which would  to help stop people from unknowingly spreading  covid-19  virus . This a political move Trump just wants to stoping the testing , just to misleading the public into believing he beat covid-19 . When actually the numbers have  risen at rapid  pace since the reopening , which is dangerous since the public will  stop wearing masks ,gloves and doing safety  precautions to keep their family/ other Americans citizens safe. Lets be honest Trump stoping the testing isnt going to stop the spread of covid-19, its just a ploy to get his numbers up in the polls .We will probably never see an end to this virus if he stops the testing, which means the people that need to be tested wont be able to get tested and more people will end up dying  The point of a president  is to keep America safe,not to just have someone elected who could care less if americans die just so he can have another presidency . Trump just wants to pretend the virus has passed ,If trump doesnt want to do his job he should step aside to allow someone else to be elected to become president that will put Americans Citizens first. After all we are in this pandemic ,because of trump ego/ ignorance that put U.S at a disadvantage. </COMMENT 10>

<COMMENT 1> I think many people, myself included, were more cautious at the beginning than now. Now that so much information has come to light it seems absurd to maintain that same level of fear that we all felt to varying degrees at the beginning. Now we know that there is a 99% survivability rate (approx.), that the numbers have been inflated the whole time, that ventilators kill people (9/10), that hydrochloriquine and zinc may help treat a large number of sick people or can be taken preventatively by at risk populations but it is being banned in certain hospitals (namely the one in NY's epicenter), that wearing masks doesn't help protect one from viruses (it even says so on the package). I could go on. While calling people who solely believe the mainstream media narrative  sheep can be harsh, I do understand the frustration people feel when they try to help others wake up by sharing information from a variety of sources only to be labeled "crazy conspiracy theorists". Divide and conquer seems to be at play here. It's been challenging but any way we can unite with others and just be kind to each other will be helpful. Divided we fall after all. </COMMENT 1>

<COMMENT 3> All of these videos from the CDC are different you are not consistent on all videos with your information mostly it sounds like you don't know any more than we do if it only enters the body from someone that's affected by the covid-19 if someone's not sick we don't have to worry about it right or wrong and if it enters your body through your sinuses we don't need mask all we need is nose plugs but all the videos on YouTube that I have watched so far none of you are saying the same thing that is killing Millions due to miss information from the CDC and every video on YouTube </COMMENT 3>

<COMMENT 6> *UPDATE:*
The CDC just announced that the United States will be shutdown for the next 100 years.  Thank you for your cooperation, and have a wonderful day. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> I heard that CDC has sent scientists to to the countries of frozen north, Norway Iceland Scandinavia ect. They are looking-for the frozen bodies of victims of Spanish flue. 
Looking for cells of the Spanish flue to revive it. 
Yes. /. No. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> The virus appears to spread easily among people, and more continues to be discovered over time about how it spreads. Data has shown that it spreads from person to person among those in close contact (within about 6 feet, or 2 meters). The virus spreads by respiratory droplets released when someone with the virus coughs, sneezes or talks. These droplets can be inhaled or land in the mouth or nose of a person nearby.
It can also spread if a person touches a surface with the virus on it and then touches his or her mouth, nose or eyes; although this isn't considered to be a main way it spreads.
Potential Solutions: -The good news is that the world is in better shape to come up with a medical solution ‚Äî a coronavirus drug or vaccine ‚Äî than it‚Äôs ever been. Within a couple of weeks of discovering the outbreak, Chinese scientists sequenced the virus‚Äôs genome and shared it with the world. The structure of the virus was revealed shortly thereafter. These developments now hold the key to creating what could end this outbreak for good: vaccines and pharmaceutical treatments. The relatively slow mutation rate of the coronavirus so far may be a promising sign for vaccine research </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> The CDC is simply a cabal criminal organization and their crimes are being unmasked. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Hypothetical situation 

America and president and CIA 
Sponsor hong Kong and Taiwan protests and riots to overthrow China government 

China defends itself by releasing 
Covid 19 a bio weapon made in labs

This shuts down china protesters 

And

Cripples America and Europe

The long term effects of covid 19

Could be

5 to 20% death rate
Extremely fast spread 
Incurable 
Infected can show no signs and infect
Disease hides and lowers immune system slowly over time similar to hiv

If it was revealed to the world that the American CDC knew whole situation but knowingly lied to the public or prevented information from being disclosed 

And

Millions and millions of Americans died

Could this trigger civil wars around the world

<COMMENT 1> I mean realistically if Phony Tony said to wear N95 butt masks, 100% of the gullibles(mostly all democrats) would go buy one. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Phony Tony has no street cred anymore. He was known about by Mikovitz decades earlier. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Remember this:  The Boomer Remover lolz!!!
Looks like it'll also be the Zoomer Consumer.
And life long complications are a fate worse than death for the young.  Much more than dying is for the aged.
Be careful about what you laugh at because now the joke's on you.  How does it feel to squeeze it on for real, junior?
Yeah, I know ... OK BOOMER.  Oh it cuts me so deep.

<COMMENT 5> Someone put this criminal in hand cuffs </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> ok boomer </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Has there been a mutation?  I wonder if there is a real increase here or if it is just an artifact of increased infection plus a dash of confirmation bias.  He also makes a good point about getting it and spreading it.  You WILL spread it.  But so many people, especially the conservative ‚Äúit is my risk, my choice‚Äù crowd, do not have the intellectual capacity to realize they ARE affecting others.  I do not think people will suddenly understand this.  They will go on, being whiney and selfish, wearing a mask with their noses hanging out, or not at all. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> There's something fishy about this.  I seriously doubt people by the masses all of a sudden went to get tested.  This is more of an attempt by the media to steal headlines again after all the looting/rioting took over.  This is FAKE NEWS.  Listen to tone of her voice.  Designed to implement fear mongering again.. Notice they lack FACTS again!!!  they do not tell how many, nor do they tell how may have NO Symptoms and No Hospitalizations.  Don't fall for this lie.  It's the media's attempt to have more restrictions in place to submit to rogue governors and mayors ALL in an effort to discredit what President Trump has done BECAUSE it's an election year!  People by the masses have NOT been going out to get tested.  If anything - there is COVID fatigue in place!  This is ONLY about population control. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> We are just getting warmed up. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> If death rate is less than 0.05% </COMMENT 10>

<COMMENT 16> What does more and more complications even mean? Like are there higher rates of young people dying or are there just increased deaths? Felt like he‚Äôs been misleading and tip toeing to the point why even look for this man to speak </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> These are no clue expert . They cannot solve thing yet know how to tell us how dangerous it is . Do we need expert for telling us there is virus and not solving anything . </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> To those talking about Fauci's "lies", please note. Science isn't as clean and precise and the things you learn in high school; finding the truth takes YEARS of peer editing and experiments. It also doesn't help when you have a giant manchild with no medical credential telling you how to do your job. Wear the goddamn mask, protect someone else's parents, and be a little courteous to others will ya? </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Mr. Fauci may be small on size but he is really big on lies! </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> In 40 years he‚Äôs never seen a pathogen like this......because this is the first one that was successfully manipulated in a lab. Maybe? These guys are all liars. </COMMENT 20>

Look who is coming together to help our President and OUR country! People who want this.country to succeed.  Ceo's and businesses are trying to keep their workers employed by changing their products to aid in producing medical supplies.¬† Restaurants are providing delivery or carry out.¬† Companies are hiring those that have lost their jobs to stock or help customers. Musicians are performing on TV to aid Americans in boredom and uplift us. Athletes and actors donating their own millions and meals to feed those in need. Churches are giving mass on tv and online.¬† The American people are making masks for healthcare, families and friends.¬† This list goes on and on and on!

Who is sitting on the A$$! Where are all the elite and rich million and billionaires that provided to the immigrants, campaigns, any complaint organization against President Trump, etc.¬† Where are the elite now? Where is peloso, schumer, adam schitt, maxine waters, kamala, booker, hirono, soros, the bloombergs, obama, biden and his rich son, jz and beyonce, robert dinero, meryl streep, julia roberts, jennifer lopez and arod, donie winnie lemon, brookie wookie, anderson cooper, chris hayes, chris cuomo, rachel madcow, dimbo agrosta (all cnn, msnbc, nbc, abc, cbs opinionists) and the list goes on and on.¬† Where are all the elite complainers NOW when it comes to helping us, our own country, the America people? 
CRICKETS! 
SILENCE! 
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!
TOO GOOD TO HELP OUR OWN COUNTRY WITH THEIR OWN MILLIONS AND BILLIONS!¬† 

Now is the time to wake up America!¬† If you want our country to be where it once was, the only person that can do that is President Trump.¬† Or we will spend the next 4 years in hearing these people and news networks bi$ch and complain and hearings for impeachment.¬† It's obvious the dummocraps, now obama and biden are using the pandemic and black lives matter movement as they do now, to blame our President.¬† He did not create this!¬† I don't see any past president or future candidate coming through for our country like President Trump has.¬† OR you can choose a dummocrap who will do nothing but blame President Trump but continue to keep this pandemic and black lives matter movement until we become a 4th world country.  WHO will bring us back from.this mess? The dummocraps, the people making this mess? Think again, they WANT this and are.allowing it.  You do not hear from them as being a problem.  WOW!!!!

WE ALL MISS AMERICA!!!

<COMMENT 20> SMH... Whatever you do, don't mention California. The state that actually has the highest number of new cases while still under some of the most severe lockdown measures. The state that has seen daily numbers (including the day this was published) almost twice as high as Arizona. You wouldn't want to let the truth slip out. And for the love of Mike, don't mention the correlation between increased testing and the increase in positive test results. We can't have the ignorant masses figuring out that testing more people means finding out that more people have the virus. They might own a calculator, and if they payed attention in 3rd grade math class they might be able to figure out the actual mortality rate is on par with the seasonal flu. The truth is out there people. Look up the numbers for yourself. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 11> en france reconfinement apres les election comme le premier tour. j'en suis plus que sur </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Bidon ! </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Arretez de croire la tv, ils veulent vous faire peur et vous vacciner. Le covid c 250 000 morts dans le monde, en 2017 ou 2018 la grippe a tu√© 1 million 500 000. En plus les chiffres de morts du covid sont gonfl√©s, ils mettent les morts de la grippe, de pneumonie, de cancer etc ! On assiste a une mega grosse manipulation comme pour la version officielle du 11 septembre. Regardez les videos de Sylvano Trotta </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Di si quelque semaines sa va √™tre la m√™me en France je le sans bien tout √ßa </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> En tout cas la vie continue ici chez nous √† g√ºtersloh, donc arr√™ter vos conneries. A propos G√ºtersloh se situe √† l est (OWL) pas l oeust. </COMMENT 15>

<COMMENT 17> Va pas  faire un fouting  tu revien avec de la transpiration tu as le covid </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Hier les gens disaient "ah enfin le d√©confinement, on va pouvoir respirer". Et aujourd'hui ils disent "voil√† ce qui arrive quand on veut d√©confiner √† tout prix". Ces m√™mes gens pensent que d√©confinement = an√©antissement du virus. S'il avait fallu attendre la fin du coronavirus pour d√©confiner, il aurait fallu attendre 2021. La reprise par √©tapes avec le respect des gestes barri√®re √©tait la meilleure solution. Si le virus repart c'est principalement la faute des gens qui font la confusion pr√©cit√©e et qui du coup n√©gligent de nouveau les r√®gles d'hygi√®ne suppl√©mentaire. Avant le confinement j'avais lu une √©tude disant "un tiers des fran√ßais ne change pas de sous-v√™tement chaque jour' et "un fran√ßais sur deux ne se lave pas les mains autant de fois que le recommande l'INPES". Et √ßa vient s'√©tonner des clusters et reconfinements partiels ! L√†, pour le coup, Macron a dit "Faites gaffe !" alors qu'on l'accuse pas d'avoir relanc√© le virus en voulant √† tout prix relancer le pays. Selon certains il aurait fallu confiner non-stop de mars 2020 √† mars 2021, mais tout le pays se serait cass√© la gueule. Au bout d'un moment il y a des gens qui me saoulent ! </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> N IMPORTE QUOI  LES TESTES ILS SONT FAUD </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 3> Y adem√°s estamos super acostumbrados en la sociedad echarle la culpa a los dem√°s. CUANDO LA RESPONSABILIDAD ES DE NOSOTROS MISMOS. Si hay incremento de casos es solo nuestra culpa.. por no seguir las recomendaciones de Salud y pensar NO PASA NADA, y luego eso s√≠, son los primeros en decir atrocidades al Gobierno o al Dr.  ESO LO CAUSA LA IGNORANCIA. En Colima la poblaci√≥n act√∫a como si no pasara nada, los negocios abiertos, de cada 100 personas solo el 15% usa cubrebocas.. SI LA INFORMACI√ìN EST√Å, POR QU√â NO CUIDARSE? </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> FALLA UN SECTOR DE LA SOCIEDAD QUE SE EXPONE INNECESARIAMENTE AL SALIR A LA CALLE, Y DESPUES CULPAR AL GOBIERNO. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Respondo... EL EXITO EST√Å EN QUE HUBO DISPONIBILIDAD HOSPITALARIA.. NO ES DIFICIL DE ENTENDER VERDAD? Digo, porque como nos dejaron el Sistema de Salud los Gobiernos pasados hubiera sido una cat√°ctrofe no actuar de manera inteligente. AUNQUE EN SU CABECITA NO SE ENTIENDA O SE COMPRENDA eso dir√≠a mucho de la persona. Solo imag√≠nense qu√© hubiera pasado si estuviera otro Gobierno en esta situaci√≥n? Horrible horrible. Lo dice alguien que es Apartidista, que no vot√≥ por este Gobiero. pero es super l√≥gico viendo la situaci√≥n y no ver la verdad de las cosas, porque si dicen lo contrario es pura POLITIQUER√çA. </COMMENT 5>

Si los mismos gobernantes ni las siguen? Se les di√≥ una opini√≥n de una videoma√±anera para evitar el contagio, como las escuelas,  pero de ahuevo quieren tener a los medios f√≠sicamente con ellos. </COMMENT 13>

<COMMENT 19> Esta es la serie de eventos:
- Gente en Wuhan comenz√≥ a enfermarse por cualquier raz√≥n.
- Cient√≠ficos comenzaron a tomar fluido de los pulmones de las personas enfermas.
- Obtuvieron lo que llamamos ‚ÄúMaterial Gen√©tico‚Äù. El cual puede ser causado por una gran lista de enfermedades.
- Lo llamaron ‚Äúvirus‚Äù. Este ‚Äúvirus‚Äù se puede encontrar en la mayor√≠a de personas.
- Comenzaron a afirmar que ten√≠an el virus debido a los s√≠ntomas.
DAVID ICKE:
‚ÄúEstoy seguro de que has escuchado que los s√≠ntomas del ‚Äúvirus‚Äù son s√≠ntomas parecidos a la gripe, estos s√≠ntomas pueden ser causados por diferentes causas. Pero ahora estos s√≠ntomas son COVID-19 as√≠ que si tienes gripa: COVID-19, toses: COVID-19‚Ä¶ as√≠ que los n√∫meros comenzaron a aumentar.
Entonces, luego desarrollaron estos test para el COVID-19 los cuales son llamados RT-PCR. Y adivina‚Ä¶ no son test para el COVID-19, son test para el ‚ÄúMaterial Gen√©tico‚Äù que causan esa gran lista de enfermedades. As√≠ que; si das positivo para ese ‚ÄúMaterial Gen√©tico‚Äù, das positivo para COVID-19. Y si mueres, mueres de COVID-19.
Pero vamos un poco m√°s en profundidad acerca de este test RT-PCR. Inventado por Kary Banks Mullis en 1994. Este test es usado para diagnosticar c√°ncer de pulm√≥n. El mism√≠simo inventor del test dijo: ‚ÄúEste test no debe ser utilizado para analizar enfermedades infecciosas‚Äù; as√≠ que est√°n usando un test que el mism√≠simo inventor dijo que no se pod√≠a usar para una enfermedad como el COVID.
Lo que hace este test es amplificar el ‚ÄúMaterial Gen√©tico‚Äù, entonces mientras que se hace mas grande durante los ciclos de amplificaci√≥n, lo que dicen que esta causando la enfermedad se hace mas grande y lo puedes ver m√°s‚Ä¶ y a su vez, el ‚ÄúMaterial Gen√©tico‚Äù tambi√©n se hace m√°s grande (Este ‚ÄúMaterial Gen√©tico‚Äù se encuentra en casi cualquier persona). As√≠ que si haces 20-30 ciclos obtendr√°s positivos y algunos negativos. Pero si haces 60-70 ciclos; virtualmente todos van a resultar positivo. Esto significa que dependiendo de la cantidad de ciclos que realices, determinas la cantidad de positivos que obtendr√°s‚Äù.
ENTREVISTADOR
‚ÄúEntonces ¬øamplificaci√≥n es que tan sensible es el test?‚Äù
DAVID ICKE
‚ÄúImagina que tienes la cabeza de un pin (simb√≥licamente), si lo haces mas grande podr√°s ver mas contenidos de la cabeza del pin.
En 1890 Rober Koch, invent√≥ los postulados de Koch. Estos eran criterios para determinar si un ‚Äúagente‚Äù era la causa de lo que t√∫ dices que causan.:
1. Todas las personas que lo tengan posean los mismos s√≠ntomas.
2. Debes aislar el ‚Äúagente‚Äù (bacteria, virus, etc.‚Ä¶), es decir que no tenga contaminaci√≥n de otro tipo de material gen√©tico.
3. Cuando t√∫ lo inyectes en un organismo vivo por ejemplo ese agente debe causar lo que t√∫ dices que causa.
4. Cuando extraigas ese ‚Äúagente‚Äù y se lo inyectes a otro organismo, el otro organismo debe tener los mismos s√≠ntomas.
Y en el caso del COVID-19 ninguno de estos criterios -los cuales se han usado desde 1890-se ha usado ni se ha cumplido.
Cuando una c√©lula est√° contaminada produce algo que se llama exosomas, y esto sucede todos los d√≠as de manera natural en respuesta a las c√©lulas contaminadas. Estas c√©lulas se pueden contaminar por toxicidad, estr√©s o miedo, enfermedades, infecciones, campos electromagn√©ticos‚Ä¶ Y la funci√≥n de estos exosomas es advertirles a las c√©lulas contiguas que hay un problema. As√≠, lo que Koch descubri√≥ es que debajo del microscopio estos exosomas y lo que es llamado ‚ÄúCOVID-19‚Äù son exactamente lo mismo; el material gen√©tico de los exosomas y lo que llaman ‚ÄúCOVID-19‚Äù son exactamente iguales en cualquier forma relevante. Lo que hicieron fue renombrar este proceso natural del sistema inmunol√≥gico; lo llamaron ‚ÄúCOVID-19‚Äù.
Asi que lo que hizo este culto que he estado nombrado desde hace tiempo quienes tienen uno de sus puntos centrales en China (tambi√©n en Usa, Israel, Inglaterra, etc.) es decirle al mundo ‚ÄúEsto es COVID-19 y estos son sus s√≠ntomas (s√≠ntomas de gripe com√∫n)‚Äù ‚Ä¶ As√≠ que los n√∫meros comienzan a subir.
El punto es que esto es un virus mortal, y la verdad es que no esta matando la suficiente gente para encajar en esta descripci√≥n. Asi que lo que hicieron es que cualquier persona que tenga alguna enfermedad incluso caerse de las escaleras, por cierto y valla al hospital, son testeados para el COVID-19. Y como est√°n testeando el ‚ÄúMaterial Gen√©tico‚Äù van a obtener una gran cantidad de positivos. Y si mueres de c√°ncer de pulm√≥n, par√°lisis o cualquier enfermedad, ellos ‚Äòoficialmente‚Äô pondr√°n que moriste de COVID-19.
Un ejemplo es Eddie Large, quien fue al hospital por Insuficiencia Cardiaca. Cuando lleg√≥ al hospital fue diagnosticado con COVID-19; porque lo testearon‚Ä¶ As√≠ que ‚Äòoficialmente‚Äô luego de diagnosticarse el COVID-19 muere‚Äù. </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 1> There seems to be that you are complete moron, it's NEVER proven that viruses are airborne nor to be transmitted between people, that's a fact backed with few studies. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> So I go online and I searched just like everybody else but I don't see no information and no data finding the same information do you have here why is that you should literally show the right information for others to read it will be the greatest idea you can ever do as a YouTuber do not make a video if you know that the information can be changed by history </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> I was just curious with all this information comes out of and I want to know the website to see how long has been this progress on computer history it has to have a date </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> So covid is literally in the air? Okay, we just need to stop breathing for the next couple of months. Easy. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Basically, it's airborne. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> If you're wondering why am here or why am doing this!, i just want to show appreciation to God, and i want other persons who is suffering from this deadly illness, ( Herpes, Coronary Artery Disease (Ischemic Heart Disease), Hiv/AID, Stroke, Trachea, Bronchus, and Lung Cancers, Diarrheal Diseases, Diabetes Mellitus, Dengue, Rotavirus, Other STD and others ) maybe because of ignorance. if you see this don't ignore, i was a victim of herpes, some one introduced him to me, i wrote him, told him what i was going through, though i was not to sure he could help, because i seen other persons, or post but no good outcome, he told me he could help, like others, i got the medicine or the herb whatever you may want to call it, he didn't even charge me, to God i didn't want to use it, but i did, to God be the glory am the one sending this post today in good health and sound mind, ..smile.. i seek for him, i didn't mind the distance so i could show appreciation, i meet with Dr Herbal, he didn't ask for anything, all he said is, 'It's God doing. I saw him treat people with different situation and problem maybe worse than yours, tell others. so am telling you today, don't ignore this, if you see this post, tell the next person who you think might need this. contact him, via his official Email:Drizazaherbalcurehome@gmail.com or WHATSAPP:+2348103355314 </COMMENT 6>

<COMMENT 13> Facing COVID Without a Home, Without Health Care, see here https://latesttalks.in/facing-covid-without-a-home-without-health-care/ </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> It's a fine video, and factual as far as I can tell.  But sometimes giving people facts without interpretation just gives them enough rope to hang themselves.  Let's be clear about something:  the examples in this video are primarily within a hospital setting and dealing with patients that are seriously ill and showing symptoms.  If you're not in that setting, don't take the entire bottle of aspirin on this.
Everyone that I know of - and this has been the case for years - is aware of the individual who comes into the office sniffling or coughing or with massive drainage.  Typically, you hear people say:  "stay home!"  And people take a wide berth around those individuals.  This common sense measure, for avoiding people who are seriously ill, has been going on for ages.
People who may be infected, but are showing few or no signs, are not going to be producing as much "aerosol" or droplets (because they don't have symptoms).  Yes, breathing produces some, but not like a seriously ill patient trapped in a hermetically sealed hospital.
Outside, in the sunshine, I just don't see it at all.  If you're not attending a rock concert, then I just don't see it.
The other thing that this video doesn't make a single mention of (and it's not a fatal flow - the scope of the video was limited) was the immune system.  It's not as if everyone who breathes in aerosol is going to get sick.  This is the thing that irritates me the most. Hardly anyone talks about the immune system.  How it works, how effective it is, what helps it.  All the talk is drugs, vaccines, face masks, and social isolation. 
That is what's sick about this whole thing.  The one thing that is responsible for delivering the human species to the 21 century, down thousands of years of known civilization with all of its pandemics along the way, was the immune system.  And when did we do all this other stuff or freak out like this?  Never...  the 1968 Hong Kong flu was worse.  2002 and 2009 were also bad.  Heck, we didn't even shut down in 1918.  It happened, and we moved on.  There seems to be little balance or reason used in the present situation.
More people will die - real deaths leaving real loved ones behind - from our response to COVID than from the actual virus.  But none of those deaths will make the evening news...  or maybe they will, but no one will connect the dots that those were preventable deaths caused by our screwed up response. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> The airborne particles don't go into your lungs and directly cause pneumonia. Covid-19 is a virus, pneumonia is from bacteria. Was this written by a 6 year old? And he used Chinese data? Yeah, thats reliable. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Evidence is now coming in that the virus main cause of transmission is through airborne especially in closed rooms or buildings which are poorly ventilated and low humidity (dry air) which causes the virus particles to float. With all the examples we have you can ask yourself with the different scenarios we have, which one is probably the most obvious cause. 
Cruise-ships with almost everyone infected at the same time. The Seattle choir who applied distance measures but almost everyone was infected. The refugee camps on lesbos where are almost no contamination's are reported (due to open tents). </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> What is Covid-10??? Is that a typo? </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Currently working with COVID19 patients, been exposed since March it hasn‚Äôt been easy; I believed the anticoagulants/antitrombolitics/DvT  treatments it‚Äôs a winner here ! decrease the mortality rates, cause by blood clots in the lungs also we are working with lots of  multi vitamins  folic acid, b12 vitamins D, boosting their immune system, A diet including supplements,  it‚Äôs all Your immune system people! And of course Wear a mask üò∑ wash your hands all the time. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Does it not require evolution of around 800,000 years or so for a novel corona virus to become airborne , yet this one novel one gets there instantly </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> We gotta ban breathing for 14 days to prevent COVID
It falls down with gravity is lie, it can stay and flot in air without wind and aerosol for long time. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 8> The hidden political influences of this organization have got us where we are today...misery and death on a scale unheard of in over a century.

<COMMENT 19> As ordinary people who have been following up on the case of COVID-19, I have several questions to consult you. So,
1. For the aircraft carrier that has been keeping away from humankind, and also for the submarine submerged under the deep ocean, how could they have an outbreak of the disease? And what is the source of infection?

2. Cases of COVID-19 have been found on the aircraft, and its servicemen have been sent for treatment in isolation. However, how could these servicemen who have recovered get infected shortly after returning back on to the ship? And how could this re-occur several times?

3. Both parents in a family were seriously ill with the virus, but how could their infant remain healthy?

4. The media has reported that a taxi driver who daily delivered taxi services for severely infected patients hasn‚Äôt been infected himself. However, how can the doctors and nurses get infected, although they are professionals and experts wearing the most protective masks, goggles and heavy protective medical suits?

5. The structure of a human body is all the same for everyone, but under the present circumstances with no proper cure available for use, how could some people, including an old man of 98 years old, get infected but then recover very quickly, and what is the reason that some young people including medical workers die after infection? How do you explain this?

6. What is the reason for an infection without any symptoms? And how can people have no symptoms when they catch the virus?

7. When Wu Han has the outbreak of COVID-19, epidemic prevention departments use tons of disinfectant to wash this city, but the incidence still remained the highest in the whole country, why was this?

I don‚Äôt understand any of the above, so please could you explain?

Thank you very much! </COMMENT 19>

<DESCRIPTION> COVID-19 has been declared a global pandemic. Businesses have shuttered, classes have been canceled, and financial markets have taken significant hits. </DESCRIPTION>

<COMMENT 1> damn in 2 months do we wish that map stayed that way </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> I hope things get well for all and soon </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> World COVID-19 cases hitting 3 million and cases in the US will reach 1 million in the next few days. However, TRUMP cited a JH STUDY stated that the US is more prepared to deal with a pandemic than any other country in the world. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> When I was young and questioned my mother, a frequent response was "because I said so, that's why".  Now that I'm adult I don't accept being treated as a child and you'll get my more willingly and immediate cooperation if you'll take the trouble to explain the why.  Keep up the good work. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> *ATTENTION Josh Sharfstein, MD, . . . could you please provide truthful, relevant, and material answers, to the following three questions, regarding COVID-19. I posted the below questions, multiple times in the last few weeks, on multiple platforms, to no avail. NO ONE has answered ANY of the below questions.*

On or about 24 MAR 2020, I submitted the following questions to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC). As of 14 APR 2020, I have received one canned response, but no answers, from the CDC.

1. Is there an electron micrograph of the pure and fully characterized virus or viruses that are alleged to cause COVID-19, and if so, could you please provide said electron micrograph?
                                          
2. What is/are the name(s) of the primary specialist peer reviewed paper(s) in which the virus(es) is/are illustrated and its/their full genetic information described?

 3. What is the name of the primary publication(s) that provide(s) proof a particular virus, or viruses, is/are the sole cause of COVID-19?
 
*Thank you!* </COMMENT 5>

<COMMENT 7> 120,000 people have died from flu in the same time covid has killed 40,000.
Why does nobody really talk about this?
Is covid really so serious or would most viruses look more scary if we watched the stats roll in on 24 hour news? </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Instead of playing chess games with the people, how about develop a successful treatment? </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Can a person who is asymptomatic be tested too soon after potential exposure resulting in a false negative test? </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> It is enlightening to listen to scientists who talk science than politicians and journalists who flood the media with fake news, fear and propaganda.  I learn a lot more than those rubbish talk. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Does the Johns Hopkins coronavirus map really show the spread of the virus or just the spread of testing for the virus? What kind of map would result if we were monitoring some other virus or flu as closely? </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> so it should be physical distancing........and social interaction.........hmmmmmm.......tks..30/3/20 </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> how vulnerable are asthmatic children? what the rate of infection or death? </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> üôè"At times, people don't pay attention to things that are important. The same is happening in India. I request people to understand facts and not believe in rumours. Covid-19 doesn't discriminate between rich and poor; it'll not spare anyone just because they perform yoga or exercise daily".üôè

<COMMENT 20> This video was posted over a week ago. We're still having major issues with people listening to the medical experts. They are the ones who are putting us at risk. If they think staying home for 2 wks is a big deal, wait until their inactions cause this to drag on for months. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 2> I think trust in a relationship is overrated. When my ex-husband started getting frequent night calls, I would ask and he would just wave off those calls as unimportant. At a time I could take no more of his lies, I decided I deserve to know what was going on so I contacted this great hacker Dr Nevetica via cybertherapies@gmail who helped clone his phone. All I did was share his phone number and through a remote link sent to my own phone, I was able to access all of his texts, calls and social media messages (Incoming, outgoing and deleted) which was how I discovered he has been cheating. Thanks to Dr Nevetica, I can now file for divorce.
If you need help or that little bit of closure, I advice you get in touch with Dr Nevetica on cybertherapies@gmail and I hope you find peace of mind just like myself after I discovered the truth. </COMMENT 2>

<COMMENT 2> If you wake up suddenly unable to breathe 

(1) Sleep in an armchair if you wake up and have difficulty breathing
(2) Sit up for an hour then go back to bed 
But now 
(3) Sleep sideways ‚Äî Change sides whenever you wake up ‚Äî you‚Äôll only be flooding one lung at a time
(4) Hold your hands above your head ‚Äî each hand holding a wrist ‚Äî it stretches lung capacity 
(5) With hands above your head, tip to the left or right then right to left
Get back to sleep üò¥ üí§ you‚Äôre tired. Tomorrow you can do exercises.

I had pneumonia and got well but I think it was CoViD 19 since I haven‚Äôt had pneumonia since I was 7 years old

If you no longer have an armchair, put your back to the wall and try to sleep that way. Use pillows for positioning </COMMENT 2>

I wish everyone watching the update saw Dr Fauci, he handled his mask throughout as others spoke, even upon removal of his mask his hands were all over his mouth and face, he then touched the podium and microphone.
Then he went on to tell everyone what they are doing wrong. ü§î </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> NCDC Should ensure that understanding COVID-19 and how to stay safe awareness are created to Urban and  rural areas regularly and effectively. Individuals , parents and groups  should do their parts by in-house awareness on preventive measures and strictly obey the rules and regulations of NCDC on COVID-19  to stay safe during COVID-19 crisis </COMMENT 2>

<COMMENT 18> Use water + soap then rub, then wash in running water etc must be applied to avoid spread of Covid:
 Mask cleaning and disposal: applying soap with 
water then rubbing and washing in running water  are important materials and steps for deactivating any virse, bacteria, insects etc. on Mask, PPE, Gloves, ... Therefore washable and reusabkle mask, gloves, PPE can be accordingly treated and dried for reuse.  Mask, gloves, PPE which are not reusable should also be cleaned with soap and water , rubbed, washed in running water then only should be thrown in dust bean or dumping place to avoid spread of virus which may be on mask, gloves, PPE... I think guidelines to open mask with stringe and throw in covered dust bean is wrong and incomplete and is a cause of spread of Corona virus.
Likewise gloves ,PPE and other items should also be treated with soap, water, rubbing, wash in running water before reuse or disposal.

<COMMENT 1> What does this have to do with neurology? </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Not only will this kill people shouldn't we be concerned about the complete lack of separation of church and state that the president hosting a rally in a church indicates? </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> It doesn't even make sense. It's not completely in the air the virus is INSIDE people. They can get it from just standing next to each other </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> why, why would that pastor let a lying devil like trump speak in front of his young people. 
what deal did you make with the devil. 
aren't pastor's supposed to warn and guard the sheep against wolf's, especially lying wolf's in sheep's clothing? </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> If you go on their site, they make use of buzzwords but don't actually show how it works. Curious, since they claim their 'method' is patented.
Here is their site, see if you can do better than I can. Presumably someone in the US can determine what their actual patent is.

<COMMENT 6> Stupid people will still go. The president dont care about them </COMMENT 6>

Who the hell is traveling when they have a temperature of 104 degrees?!!!!!
Who can stand up at that temperature?
I think if a person has a temp of 99 they would be asked to go home or to the hospital to get checked out.  Most people have a low temp not the higher one. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> I think this is trumps plan to kill anyone over 65 to lower social security debt. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> of course chumps not worried because everyone who comes in contact with him is tested....But the audience in that church should be worried of taking it home to someone that has medical problems. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> this lets me know the leaders of this church don't believe in Jesus! </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Even without experts debunking the claim, if there really was filtration tech that killed 99.9% of COVID19, why wouldn't we install such system elsewhere besides churches? üò∞ Also, what if the system does work but some get infected within the 10 mins? üòå </COMMENT 17>

<COMMENT 1> You will be out of the office in 2 years. One term premier. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> 26:00 </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Starts at 25:50 </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> It is painful to listen to politicians find problems and pretend to fix them. 
The Premier with no education beyond high school is pretending to care about the education system he has made cuts to in the middle of a pandemic. 
The Minister of Education (previously Minister of Communications for Harper) thinks e-learning is a good thing. 
Children do not go to school to learn, they go to school to learn how to learn!
If you cannot understand that, you should not be involved in education at all. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Yes, Grade 1 students should learn about credit and debt!!! Sheesh!! </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> So now that EQAO has been cancelled this year will you be re-writing the test to reflect the new curriculum??? </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Teach children why government is mathematically justified in preventing medical treatment of seniors inside of medical facilities. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Wow!
Good for you Ford Government. 
I remember during my younger days, we were forced to memorize the multiplication tables.
Since the Harris days, I've noticed that the education system in Ontario has declined markedly, especially in mathematics. 
It is nice to see this government taking strides to improve these skills as well as putting financial literacy in place so that students understand how to utilize their finances correctly. 
I wish they thought us this financial literacy during my elementary school days.
I am now in my late 40's. 
The next thing they have to bring back is phonics and make students understand the components of a sentence. 
Great first step, Doug Ford! </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> This guy is controlled oppo </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Teachers are too busy radicalizing your children while posessing a deep misunderstanding of how things actually work, and or they hate children. Lotta childless weirdo teachers subscribed to marxism. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> It took 10 years of EQAO, to tell you what teachers have been saying all along......kids do not know their basic number facts!!
Stop wasting money on senseless testing, and LISTEN TO YOUR FRONT LINE WORKERS (aka TEACHERS)!!!!
Congrats on stepping up the financial literacy aspect though. </COMMENT 11>

And two maniquensset at different distances completely air seal the room and propol it to the distance someone. Ight s eeze to or even vomit may e cos there travel sick and my have to remove mask I would lay any bstthat if they could do that 5 days later which is incubation period when they securarly check room it would go beyond 6 feet I know I'm sticking to 6 feet and if I have to travel out of my home town use a taxi trya bus when I feel more confident just to try a few mins journey then aten mins journey and I need to see new cases in our area go way down and maybe to a much lower level ie 10 a week before I will trust uses and if any jobsworth said you can get on a bus I would say you get on a busy bus and 5 days later e tested if you do that a few times and are clear I might get on a bus but I'd rather have a immunity test first and there's not much chance of that is their it's all right for Boris and them to talk they don't use buses or go into crowded shops they've no idea how we all live especially mental health and anxiety problems I didn't sleep well other night because I know I was going to another town all be it in a taxi but it was fine I was poorly early April for two weeks when the covid line thought I'd possibly got it and then I'd got a chest infection and had to have 5 lots of antibiotics and a chest xray I'm a asthmatic but cos I don't have severe asthma or use steroid tablets or ever. Een in hosp with asthma couldn't go on shieldering list I think I had it and was isolating 5 week cos I live in a independent living scheme with older people if someone in a shop queue as much as slightly cough I shoot down next aisle I'm not taking risks the first week I was coughing so much and gasping for breath I had a job to get my postcode out to ambul control they were very good but I really thought due to how I react with bpd thought I'm going to die so was in floods of tears when paramedics arrived they stayed a while to reassure me but for three weeks I had nightmares 3 days I have achy wrists before this I could spend all evening on tablet without wrists aching but not know its made my dbt worse and depression and I've been lucky I have warden buzzing me 3 times a week and ca.

<COMMENT 7> Ok the pastors themselves said it took 10 minutes to "clean" the air...what do they think is happening during that 10 minutes to the virus that's been expelled in a packed crowd? And for every new covid-infected batch of droplets, another 10 minutes will be necessary. So for a single infected person in a maskless packed crowd, each breath is potentially infectious and has 10 minutes to find new hosts. And given the explosion of infections in the area, how likely is it that only one person will come in carrying the virus? The pastor's obvious cheer struck me as ghoulish, though I'm trying to believe it's just misplaced faith and a fundamental misunderstanding of some of these concepts...but I'm having a hard time convincing myself. </COMMENT 7>

<COMMENT 17> They are in denial. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Having less than the required number of nurses working with that high of acuity, and nurses working that much overtime is very dangerous for the people actually being able to receive care.  We should all be frightened. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> I am a retired nurse, 73 years old, with heart problems.  But when I watched this, I so desperately wanted to go there and help in some way.  I've worked in crises situations in the ER (nothing like this, though) and I know how wrenching and exhausting it is.  My heart goes out to all of our medical workers, including the housekeeping staff. ü•∞ This president has made your situation so much worse than it should be. </COMMENT 19>

If you try to look for certain information it just takes you to ‚Äúwhat covid symptoms feel like‚Äù üôÑ K...but how do we live other than social distancing and washing our hands? </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Mental health? Try gout attacks and an inguinal hernia </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> I thought I was immune to the psychological effects of lockdown because I am an introvert and a gamer ... but I am starting to lose it after four months of curfew/lockdown. I am going crazy mentally and sunk into depression ... even introverts need social interaction </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Awsome video. Tq for info.its really heplful :) </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> üëÄ also seek medical medication if you think you have serious mental problems, or even check your state if they allow recreational marijuana. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Can you make a video about anxiety coming out of quarantine? PLEASE!! </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> I work for a hospital, I‚Äôm working from home due to covid19, anyone healthy are working from home, so i hear about the seriousness of this from work, I have a daughter, she and her husband understand the seriousness, are following the cdc guidelines, they have a son with an autoimmune disease, my son and his wife think this is a hoax, they don‚Äôt wear masks, they gather with my daughter in law‚Äôs family, so i look like weird Grandma...I‚Äôve thrown myself into sewing and gardening, I don‚Äôt know how to navigate between these two worlds, today I‚Äôm feeling beyond overwhelmed, I‚Äôm crying from all the pent up distress, </COMMENT 7>

<COMMENT 9> We have started this initiative.

As we all know each one of us is dealing with anxiety or depression in some way or the other, this is a forum to help each other out by sharing our experiences and  let go of the unseen pain. 
Trust yourself. You‚Äôve survived a lot, and you‚Äôll survive whatever is coming.

<COMMENT 10> I hate this so much, i‚Äôam a 14 y.o and last half year/8 month‚Äôs I‚Äôve started to go back into society and not sitting all day in home. Since January/februari I‚Äôve overwon my depression. But this quarantine has been killing me fr. atm I feel so lonely and feel like I have 2 good friends left :/ </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Whenever I am feeling stressed out by the Coronavirus, I just play some Three Beat Slide music and my anxiety disappears...It's like some kind of magical drug that makes me feel happy again </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> This very important video lesson and should be given in the beginning of COVID-19. Thanks, though it given at this time. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Good to know </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> What could help America's mental well this is to get all the information that is wrong off of the TVs the radios and YouTube about the covid-19 we are pounded with it as a daily dose how many people died do this do that the only ones we should be listening to is scientists that know what they are talking about don't watch the news don't watch the talk shows anybody that's talking about covid-19 ignore it unless they're telling you there is a cure I have been doing that I've been staying home I wear a mask when I go to the store to get groceries other than that I stay at home which I have been doing all along enjoy your day don't listen to the news they just stress you out more thank the media add information </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Great presentation </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> I have been so stressed out that for the first time in my entire life i have skipped my period! I am a fully grown woman well into adulthood but not quite close to the change yet. I have all of my usual PMS symptoms,  horrible cramps and that dreadful hormonal change that makes my head spin and feel horrible but no period. My cycles are like clock work. They NEVER skip... anytime i thought it would not come it always popped up by night fall or early small hours but not this time. This is how stressed ive been. And NO i am  NOT pregnant.. unless you believe in the 2nd coming of Jesus </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> At t=6:38 he talks about one thing that is really helpful - that is to connect and reconnect with your core social support network (spouse, siblings, children, closest friends), and contact them over the phone or over social media. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> You also didn't mention the huge chance of contracting other diseases while in a hospital. </COMMENT 18>

<COMMENT 1> Video of food workers, no masks, exhaling on the containers.... Priceless! </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Nothing has changed. The whole world was given the same information to act on months ago. The US has politicised the virus, had desperately lacked testing & tracking, completely failed at closing borders which had led to it being the worlds Epi-center for COVID19. If Americans simply listened & acted upon Scientists advise it would not be in the dire situation it is in now. This is now the culling of American people, ironically by American people. Dead men walking. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Latest study of successful treatment from France - 99% efficacy. 3,700 subjects. Incredible. It's not a pandemic if you don't want it to be. https://youtu.be/vgQqT2xbXlo </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Why is CBS using "superforecasters" to predict what the Democrats want to do with CoVid?  Is it because the regular forecasters got so much of it wrong? </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Say no to MANDATED vaccines! 
It is the most insane concept that people must all blindly and forcibly trust anyone with their health and bodies, let alone the ultra rich.
No one should be forced to take injections of medication into their body.
It‚Äôs a crime against humanity forcing people to comply with medical mandates.
Remember people there have been laws put in place during the 80s to protects vaccine developers from litigation, it‚Äôs basically free money and close to ZERO liability for them. 
Since this law, the vaccine schedule went from 10 to over 70 vaccines on the schedule  by the age of 12! Wake up
People the correlation with their profit and your sickness is grossly obvious.

Even with this virus, the rich have made 650billon more while the average citizen is experiencing job loss, business shutdown, food lines, and dependency on fickle government handouts.
They won‚Äôt stop until they are stopped. 
Medical freedom should not be a fight. Take vaccines if you want there is nothing wrong with informed consent, but these medical mandates are very sad step in a very dystopian reality. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Well.

They give the agenda away. </COMMENT 6>

<COMMENT 11> So "accurate" forecasting now means throwing up a number between 168M and 560M? Between 168M and 560M???? So just pick a number? Any number? SMH. Just when I think MSM's news entertainment nonsense can't get any sillier, they do. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Increase in cases while decrease in deaths means the stupid youngsters aren't taking any precautions while at the same time older people and sick people aren't taking ANY chances. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> I recommend reading the book ‚ÄúSuperforecasting‚Äù by Tetlock and Gardner if you are curious about how these predictions are made. </COMMENT 13>

<COMMENT 20> Peolpe haven't figured out that the COVID19 microbes are on people's clothing and in crowds there's a massive amount of microbes that become airborne and contaminate the air-supply in parking lots and within stores. These microbes will remain airborne for many days outdoors and many weeks indoors. These microbes live off the humidity in the air and can stay alive for many months. 
There has to be build air disinfecting systems for parking lots and when a store is closed and no one is inside a chemical misting machine is activated to decontaminate the store. Two hours prior to opening fans can vent out the stores and enclosed parking lots.

China had already done this and their death numbers have dropped dramatically.

If people don't take this situation seriously thousands MORE will die.

Then tens of thousands 

Then  hundreds of thousands 

Then Millions 

This situation is NOT going away any time soon so we need to take this situation as serious as the Chinese have. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 1> So many individuals and Canadian businesses who have done what they can to meet the challenges in this pandemic and have really pitched in. And we should be so proud of them. But they seem to be among a very small number. Now my province of Ontario is opening up, I am seeing people crammed together on outdoor patios at pubs and bars or walking side by side in huge numbers on the beachfront, as if the pandemic never was. As if it has gone away for good. We have only to look to our Americans neighbours to understand what denial and irresponsibility does: it brings the virus back. It makes me sad to see such a disregard for others in the actions of many. </COMMENT 1>

<COMMENT 9> LMAO   i have a vpn    im in Russia , mexico , the world </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Force people to do contact tracing then </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Can we all just get over ourselves cause guess what plant earth has a 100% Death Rate on one gets off alive. What we should worry about is what kind of planet and social structures  we are leaving behind for our children and grandchildren. One where the 99% is enslaved by the 1% sociopath. That want to force inject us with what ever DNA altering toxic stew whenever they feel like it.Where there is no freedom to travel sell or buy.  Hopefully this will wake people up and we can have a phone smashing tea party. Like the Boston tea party </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> So in other words, 1 in 370 Canadians have the flu virus. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Saw this coming a mile away </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Only migrant where given phone , i was not allowed in the program as i am native. Even if i had the money i would not buy one, specially Huawei one. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> is anyone gonna point out the fact that despite there being zero mention of asians in this video, a picture of two asian ladies is used as the thumbnail? </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Let‚Äôs see this past seasons, influenza A and B numbers. It should be around 5,000( as it is every year). So, with the apparent 8,200 corona deaths, we should have a total of 12,300 deaths from flu and corona, this past flu season... 

I have a feeling this won‚Äôt be the case. It will prove that our doctors have just given the flu, a new name. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> They say a different story daily! </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> They say a different story daily! </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> The description of the app makes it sound like people who have tested positive are then wandering around the community potentially infecting people. I‚Äôm pretty sure they didn‚Äôt mean that infected people aren‚Äôt isolating after testing positive. Lol. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Thank you for providing statistics, to show that 97% of the deaths are from those aged 60+. Of the 8200 deaths, about 250 people have died from covid, that were aged 0-59. Although death in general is unfortunate, I'm sure there's MANY other things in our society that are killing us left right and center. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 1> Mais vous allez aretez avec votre cirque sur le Covid ? Le nombre de cas explose vu que maintenant on teste √† tour de bras : il y a 3 mois pile on avait test√© 468 000 personnes positives et aujourdhui pr√®s de 9 millions. Mais cela ne signifie aucunement que toutes ces personnes vont contracter la maladie ou mourir ! ce chiffre prouve surtout que le taux de mortalit√© est tr√®s bas si on compare √† d'autres √©pid√©mies qui ont fait des millions de morts. Car oui parlons en des morts : 500 000 morts en 7 ou 8 mois,  95% concernant des + 65 ans et des sujets √† risque (comorbit√©, pollution, tare g√©n√©tique). Maintenant j'exige aussi qu'on nous fasse le d√©compte des morts du cancer et de ceux qui le contractent tous les jours.

<COMMENT 4> in march i had an inflamed chest for over a month that flared up and down, that was my main symptom (i wasn't even that tired, like i was more tired than ususal as i was ill, but i kept to my normal schedule) though i did lose my appetite. never had a cold or flu like it, still frustrating that i couldn't get tested because i don't know if i had it. (no-one else in my family got sick either despite the fact that i live with them and its supppossedly very contagious, and i did isolate, but only after i felt breathlesss, so like five days into my symptoms).

<COMMENT 1> I was wayting for more. Apres 4 mois j'attendait plus que la masque et les symptomes. Merci. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Thank you for the regular updates.  We look forward to WHO finding a cure soon. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Useful information </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> The W.H.O stated that there is not a big risk of Covid-19 on shoes, but warned that people should take off their shoes.  If it is not a risk why then remove shoes?  So I just would like to know.  if it is droplets, it will land on the floors, can it not then picked up on the soles of your shoes and carried to where ever you go?  The CDC recommended that all hospital staff sanitize shoes before leaving hospitals.  Surely the public should also do this?  Or am I misunderstanding the myth published. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> La propagation du virus √† COVID 19 est en cours alors le respect des mesures barri√®res demeurent la meilleur pr√©vention; ce virus √† certes de limites aupr√®s des personnes asymptomatiques, mais la transmission se poursuit </COMMENT 5>

<COMMENT 3> I'm having soar throat, shortness of breath üòê now after watching this video I have anxiety too! Fu*k :/ </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> motherfucker china </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> For the survivors* </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> My gf was positive is it normal for me to had symptoms 1 days after seeing her? Or is that too soon. I had a bad headache and fever </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> I might have corona I‚Äôm so scared  I dont want to die </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> This is for anyone who is really scared of COVID-19.
I'm currently quarantining in a medical resort that only patients who tested positive can be there and stay for 2 weeks before taking a new test. I'm currently on day 8 after my positive results and I have ZERO symptoms so far not even a cough and my temp is very normal. I asked 19 patients who live with me about their experience and their symptoms and it breaks down as follow:
- 12 patients feel very normal and have no symptoms what so ever. (age roughly 19-33) (most of them passed 5 days in quarantine)
- 3 patients can't taste food and are unable to smell fragrances but has no fever or other symptoms. (age roughly 30-35) (most of them passed 5 days in quarantine)
- 3 patients has slight fever roughly between 38 to 38.3 and 3 of them has dry cough and one of them has slight burning sensation in the chest area. (age roughly 30-35) (most of them passed 5 days in quarantine)
- 1 patients suffered from fatigue, dry cough, fever and headache. He might have more symptoms that I'm not aware of but he looked quite tired to me. (age 36) (passed 3 days in quarantine).

and in my case I'm 27 years old and so far everything is fine. I make sure that I take multivitamin, omega 3 and Vitamin D every single day to make sure that my body is not lacking any vitamins. please note that I'm not a doctor/expert and i was not asked by medical staff to take any of these supplements.

<COMMENT 1> I saw them giving South Africans a Vaccine. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> *_WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS..._* if it is still unclear as to whether having and recovering from CoViD-19 actually provides any long-term immunity, what chance does a vaccine (which is essentially like a 'watered-down version of it) have of immunizing one against it??? </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Vaccines cause autism. My 2 year old got autism just after his Flu shot :( DON'T GET VACCINATED the chips will give you autism and cancer please research this please https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ </COMMENT 3>

<COMMENT 5> PLEASEEE LISTEN TO ME. Im not ur common idiot that thinks he knows it all BUT a vaccine means THEY ARE PUTTING THE VIRUS IN U!!!! PLEASE DONT BE A FOOL!!! Us against the world!!! We are 1!!!! THIS IS ALL LIES. Prove to UR SELF ur not a gullible moron. I beg u...From 
"The Original" :) </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Why do people keep repeating 'This is an unprecedented time' or 'These unprecedented times times'? If they're referring to the pandemic, there have been pandemics before so it isn't without precedence. But if they're referring to the time itself, all time is unprecedented in that time never repeats. It only moves forwards. What does it actually mean? This is typical political nonsense. They programme a meaningless catchphrase into people by way if the media and everyone goes round repeating these things so they feel as though they know what they're talking about. </COMMENT 6>

<COMMENT 12> I have 2 questions:
1. you said, "because they're not actually inserting a modified virus into individuals, but rather a sequence that codes for the tiny protein spikes that are on the virus that connect with human cells." at 03:55. Is this true?
2. This method sounds too simple, why isn't there a vaccine yet? </COMMENT 12>

<COMMENT 2> Did I hear say Dr. S say that Zpacks could also cause QT prolongation?  Never had a doctor warn about z pack before prescribing so must be a small concern so maybe same holds true with hydroxychloraquin </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Most of the human population are carriers of at least one parasite. Every day the organisms of millions of people struggle with uninvited guests who threaten their life and health. Pathogens and toxins cause a number of ailments harming the nervous, digestive respiratory and circulatory systems as well as muscles and skin, worsening well-being and hindering everyday functioning.https://nplink.net/gwb1ypi1 </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> How are asymptomatic COVID-19 patients treated?  Do they go into self quarantine and let their immune system clear the virus from the body naturally? </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> The virus is spreading like wildfire Cuz the media is lying to us because the media are into their plan of reducing the world's population because the media's and the journalist or not doing their work telling us that they have mixed the AIDS virus with the SARS virus to create the covid-2 aka covid-19 dec 19th 2019 and that if we don't protect ourself we will all die. you guys are making jokes in the media creating debates but you are not telling us the truth you just keep showing us people with pins on the jacket representing the reduction of the world's population since the 19th of December 2019 the Chinese warn the world. donald john trump closed the doors. Thats the only news that's important. You guys don't have one journalist. you guys don't have one person that said the truth since November 2019 all the news are accomplice, they repeat what they are told they don't investigate they are no journalists in no establishment. Not one real journalist they just want to have their paycheck and they repeat what they are told to say they are dogmatic.*NO TESTING, NO VACCIN, NO PLAN BUT THEY WANT YOU TO GO BACK TO WORK, MONEY IS ALL THEY WANT, THEY DONT CARE ABOUT THE DEADS.

how people pass on the virus in video. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> COVID19 travelled the world for ten weeks before making it to the US. Either this disease is not at all as serious as people are saying, which is supported by the corrected facts (the correct data is not what WHO and CDC) refects, or the disease that we are all fearing is not COVID19 (at least, not as described). </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> My wife has been social distancing me for years no big deal. I use to cough to cover up a fart now I fart to cover up a cough. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Baffin Island is nice this time of year. :^) </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Those drugs can't possibly be effective at fighting this virus! Trump said something positive about them. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> High degree body &enviroment temperatures can kill Coronavirus.Thats why pozitive people have fever and South coountries which are now in Summer have few number of cases.
We should increase our body temperature for short periods and always have Summer conditions in our rooms
Coronavirus behave such as influenza virus which die and disappear in summers </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> ‚ÄúWhen I am afraid, I will trust in you.‚Äù Psalms 56:3

<COMMENT 12> corona virus¬†is evil and it was brought to kill in other to reduce the numbers of people on earth especially china¬†, anything evil is associated to the devil and the only way to fight fight evil is spirituality¬†and that is why the great prophet noble is here to help people fight and defeat COVID19 (corona-virus) with his powerful covidspell that he is using to cure treat and cure people of corona virus¬†and this is why there is no record of corona virus death in Africa¬†especially Nigeria,¬†i am a living witness of prophet noble spiritual power as he just cured my friend who was covid 19 positive few weeks ago and now he is negative . hurry now and contact prophet noble to get your covidspell via NOBLESPELLHOME@GMAIL. COM¬† you can also chat him up on Whatsapp via¬†+2349059610643 thank you. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Can a virus spread by air? </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> So if 80% of people who get this only get mild symptoms (and acquire anitbodies at that), and most people survive and never need to  be hospitalized, and only 1% die, why is everyone reacting so extreme?  
Even if there is a vaccine, many wont take it </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> What are your thoughts about Hydroxychloroquine & Azithromycin? Thanks doc for your videos... </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> The best known way to fight off Covid 19 is to increase intracellular (inside the cell) zinc. The best known way to increase intracellular zinc is to stop consumption of phytic acid. What has a lot of phytic acid? Grains, nuts, seeds, beans, coconuts, coffee, basically all seeds. SO.... The best way to treat or preven Covid 19, in my opinion, is to stop consuming seeds </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> It work 100% use this medicine about 20 years for malaria I didn't see any side effects. malaria, common cold and flu have the same symptoms on me even I can't I identify which one I sick but when I took Chloroquine even the common cold is heal in my experience I used Chloroquine for flue and common cold for me it work. So COVID-19 is a family of flu I believe it work. But pregnant women don't take it the result is abortion I knew a lot of women using for abortion so you have talk with your doctor don't take without your doctor advice. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> I've been unable to find clear answers but is it possible this virus can be contracted from a person, be in there system for 4-28 days and they experience NO Symptoms or Symptoms like a very minor tickly cough and still spread it? </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Expeditetools,com made a safe transfer of $25,000 to my account. </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 5> Dr. Didier Raoult, MD, PhD - by now he has used this treatment on more than 2500 patients with incredible results...he has done more research in Europe on Covid-19 & its treatments (& posted it) than anyone and they are all flocking to him for guidance, as did the French president Macron and Dr Oz.  We don't need dirty vaccines and inappropriately used ventilators that are killing people!  Pls watch the following link from Dr. Cameron Kyle-Sidell: @3r2o

<COMMENT 9> Hello my friends may we overcome this as quickly as we can. Peace be upon those who have passed away. As you mentioned in the video the pyrithione pt = ionophore helps the zinc particle pass through the cell by making the wall of the cell accessible. What if you could make a Pyrithione pt ionophore that does the opposite. Stops anything from entering the cell or breaching the cell wall. Then the virus wont have an access point at all. Thus stopping cell contamination. </COMMENT 9>

<COMMENT 13> Where can I get hydroxychloroquine from doctor won't prescribe me </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Zinc orotate is well absorbed in the gut and the orotate molecule escorts the zinc into cells.  If getting zinc into the cells was chloroquine's only job zinc orotate might do the job but i think chloroquine works in other ways as well.  chloroquine is well absorbed and has a long half life in the body and is concentrated in the spleen, liver, and lungs many times over what it is in the blood.  Zinc oxide is poorly absorbed,3%, in the gut and taking more will give you the runs.  Generally zinc chelated to an an amino acid is well absorbed - zinc orotate is the best. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> The absolutely unreal and absurd part about this are all the studies for HCQ to show it as ineffective and dangerous. These ‚Äústudies‚Äù were intentionally designed to fail. It is pseudo-science, more like scientific hackery to carry out a political agenda. Any family that lost a loved one that was part of these studies should sue them for endangering the patients. No patient with heart problems or hypertension and a covid infection should be given HCQ. That‚Äôs idiotic and is malpractice. We all know that would be a fail. This is like saying the way to show how effective razors are in shaving we will test it on people with beards. Well, that will be a fail for people with beards ‚Äîa razor is NOT the right tool if you have a long beard and we know that even before we test it. So why do it? Because you want it to fail. And say, we told you razors are no good in shaving....see see? </COMMENT 15>

<COMMENT 5> This is a good way to collect and create the largest genome database of people, the people will give it over freely. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Beijing could not hold the info back anymore.  It must show some transparency because China has already pissed off the rest of the world.  It cannot afford to lose the complete trust of the rest of the world.  Also Beijing is the capital and there are lots of foreign embassies there.  So I expect CGTN to be more transparent.  However again, it starts with the diversion of saying it is from Europe.  
Now this line will be poo-poo'd pretty quickly because everyone knows virus's do not go from humans to fish and back to humans again.  This is cross contamination.  Also the salmon supplier had no one with covid and no other client canceled their orders.   The notion of virus coming from another animal is again diversion and a lie.   
Beijing need to look at cross contamination sources.   China may have opened up the country a bit too soon.  They had to, because of the imminent collapse of its economy. </COMMENT 6>

<COMMENT 15> Hi,
Some months ago I had s*x with the third guy in my life whom i was about to marry and now I have herpes. I couldn‚Äôt believe it because he wasn‚Äôt a random guy, he‚Äôs the closet guy I‚Äôve had as a boyfriend, but it has been a never ending nightmare since. I‚Äôve always believed in GOD and have asked him for forgiveness which is ironic.
I felt like killing myself with the taught of having a husband and family will be quite difficult and i felt like I‚Äôm not really in the room when people are talking. I didn‚Äôt know what to do and pretty much cry and pray every day to God for help and looking at my family with so much love and feeling that i have disappointed them even though they don‚Äôt know. Until God lead me to DR. IZAZA online who promised to help me cure my disease through herbals. At first i didn't believe him, but to my greatest surprise i was cured completely by herbals, which medical doctor also verified that i was cured. Special thanks to DR. IZAZA.
Don't be discourage because he that did it for me will also do it for you and you can contact him through his email address (DRIZAZAHERBALCUREHOME@GMAIL.COM) or text him on WHATSAPP phone number +2348103355314 </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> If I did that every time I entered a room then I would not be able to see many patients.  My experience in the hospital is that the Physicians do not enter a room and rely heavily on the Respiratory Therapists.  It makes better sense to take off your PPE then at the very end to wash your hands with soap and water. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Thanks so much for all these lessons - you Dr. Seheult are so intelligent and scientific and you are an EXCELLENT teacher (explainer - ha ha). I've been watching you since March  - almost before you began numbering your Covid updates.  [I do not understand though, why when doffing, there is so much 'waste' of hand sanitizing in between removing and throwing the PPE in the trash?]  You touch the hair cap, hands are contaminated, so then touch the gown, then etc.  then when done, then hand sanitize.   I am sure you have a reason, but it sure looks like a lot of waste of time and sanitizer. ] </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Thank you for your calm demeanor and easily followed explanations of complex physiologic mechanisms.  You are a beacon of light in the storm of misinformation.  I look forward to future updates. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> 42:00 a young lady refused to lay on her belly.
The doctors told her often enough and she did not want and did not do.
When the doctors turned her, she improved within 30 minutes.

This knowledge was well known in Italy. Everybody in Europe got it from news.
In March when so many patients in Italy could not go on ventilators, they did flip the patients every 12 hours.

If a patient does not participate you just send them home. They do not deserve any help. 
This stupid young lady keeps a bed from somebody who really is in need.

Survival of the intelligent people seems to be the case at Covid19. </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 8> There is more and more evidence that Covid19 patients die from embolisms. Check on : https://www.physiciansweekly.com/venous-and-arterial-thromboembolic-complications-in-covid-19-patients-admitted-to-an-academic-hospital-in-milan-italy/
I found also a Study about Treatment Covid19 with Aspirin https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04365309 
Also Tumeric as a natural blutthinner and immun booster: https://youtu.be/NMqlcCuFneU
PLUS Summary about Vit.D3 and Covid19 symptoms : https://youtu.be/GCSXNGc7pfs
AND VERY IMPORTANT FOR LATIN ASIAN AND AFROAMERICAN POEPLE: " The numerous and disproportionately frequent deaths of Covid-19 patients with dark skin colour and from southern countries are apparently also the result of a drug-related mistreatment. Affected are people with a specific enzyme deficiency, which occurs mainly in men whose families come from regions where malaria was or still is endemic. They are currently being treated with hydroxychloroquine, a drug which they do not tolerate, now being used all over the world to fight Covid-19. If this practice does not end soon, there is a great risk of widespread deaths, especially in Africa."

<COMMENT 10> Peolpe haven't figured out that the COVID19 microbes are on people's clothing and in crowds there's a massive amount of microbes that become airborne and contaminate the air-supply in parking lots and within stores. These microbes will remain airborne for many days outdoors and many weeks indoors. These microbes live off the humidity in the air and can stay alive for many months. 
There has to be build air disinfecting systems for parking lots and when a store is closed and no one is inside a chemical misting machine is activated to decontaminate the store. Two hours prior to opening fans can vent out the stores and enclosed parking lots.

China had already done this and their death numbers have dropped dramatically.

If people don't take this situation seriously thousands MORE will die.

Then tens of thousands 

Then  hundreds of thousands 

Then Millions 

This situation is NOT going away any time soon so we need to take this situation as serious as the Chinese have. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> I don't  believe you . I will just inject lysol into my veins. </COMMENT 11>

<COMMENT 13> Hey I am a covid 19 patient. 
I am  suffocating badly and breathing is really uncomfortable and painful.
No doctor or hospital is treating the normal patients other than VIP or political persons. Please pray for my recovery.  I dont want to suffer anymore. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> This is why all you people need to take those mask off, all you're doing is huffing your own bodies waste and the moisture that your body has already expelled.
 continuously huffing all this will fill your lungs up with moisture while  increasing the risk of viral infection...... 
when you have a mask on the air will take the path of least resistance which is around the edges of the mask and not through the mask.
a mask is only good for splatter and will not stop a virus that is small enough to ride on air ( hence)  the air can get through the mask and so can anything small enough that can be air born.. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Wow sir!Super! </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> I have a theory for a potential treatment. To make a continuous linked blood transfusion from pa patient that has recovered and has antibodies over a period of several hours, so that the recovered patients internal organs such as liver, kidneys, lungs and other active organs and antibody production could all contribute to restoring the ill patients health. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Is this prone positioning good for someone with posible covid, with fluid in his lungs, enlarged heart but NOT in ICU/ventilator/intubated? He is just using oxygen. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> No one has ever died of a viral infection. No one has ever seen, or isolated any virus. In fact, there is NO empirical evidence to support even the *existence* of viruses. In short, they are the stuff of sci-fi.  A thorough search, worldwide, in seventeen countries and in nine languages, has yielded nothing but childishly bright-coloured cartoons, outrageously vivid _Technicolor_ CGI's and the odd monochrome (black & white)  photo (?) of an exosome, disingenuously tossed into the mix, to add a thin veneer of plausibility to the lies. Exosomes, however, are not viruses, nor can they be transmitted between individuals, and they don't cause illness or disease, much less, death. This entire coronavirus narrative, is a psyop, and any contention to the contrary, is a falsehood. Whether this be intentional or not, we need not discuss here. Only those who are ashamed or afraid to show their faces, wear masks. Masks impare respiration, cost money, cause clutter and litter, and look ridiculous. Distancing is ANTI-SOCIAL. This video is absolute nonsense. The entire coronavirus narrative, is a psyop. Don't say no one told you when your kids come and ask you :  "Mom, Dad....what were YOU doing while the Establishment was stealing our lives...?" </COMMENT 18>

In medical literature the words asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic are often used interchangeably. </COMMENT 11>

Abstract

Background: An ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread around the world. It is debatable whether asymptomatic COVID-19 virus carriers are contagious. We report here a case of the asymptomatic patient and present clinical characteristics of 455 contacts, which aims to study the infectivity of asymptomatic carriers.

Material and methods: 455 contacts who were exposed to the asymptomatic COVID-19 virus carrier became the subjects of our research. They were divided into three groups: 35 patients, 196 family members and 224 hospital staffs. We extracted their epidemiological information, clinical records, auxiliary examination results and therapeutic schedules.

Results: The median contact time for patients was four days and that for family members was five days. Cardiovascular disease accounted for 25% among original diseases of patients. Apart from hospital staffs, both patients and family members were isolated medically. During the quarantine, seven patients plus one family member appeared new respiratory symptoms, where fever was the most common one. The blood counts in most contacts were within a normal range. All CT images showed no sign of COVID-19 infection. No severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections was detected in 455 contacts by nucleic acid test.

Conclusion: In summary, all the 455 contacts were excluded from SARS-CoV-2 infection and we conclude that the infectivity of some asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers might be weak.

Keywords: Asymptomatic carrier; Contacts; Infectivity; SARS-CoV-2.

<COMMENT 1> This video told me everything I needed to know about this channel ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> More scare tactics. This video just adds to the confusion. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> People are still believing this is real??.... there is PROOF that a person who committed suiside had "death due to Covid-19" on their death cert. explain that one... </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> About time we nuke china </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> How deadly is COVID-19 ?
Not much </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> R.I.P. Domingo and all that died bc of this </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Thank you for taking a largely apolitical, honest look at the actual statistics. One thing that could be mentioned as another factor is the controversy about what qualifies as a ‚ÄúCOVID death‚Äù, as some hospitals are reporting that they are being pressured to declare anyone who dies *with* COVID as having died *from* COVID. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> SIMPLIFY;   HOW  MANY DEATHS  HOW MANY SICK IN HOSPITAL ,  DONT COUNT ELDERLY IN CARE .   THEY ARE SICK MANY HEALTH ISSUES..  A COLD CAN PUSH THEM TO DEATH.
......YOU ARE SELLING FEAR AND PANIC.  FOR PROFIT. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Great video. For the post guys, I recommend considering adding a transient designer to the voiceover and pulling down the transients a bit. They're a bit sharp in this video. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> According to this research...... No STONKS </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> So what you're saying is CV19 is a disease. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> This was a great piece. Thank you Vox. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Rest in peace Domingo may Allah guide your path. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> And remember, this will go one for at least 2 years </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> China needs to stop eatinh bats and snakes.  I mean all animal that is deadly </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> What was the point for this video ? </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Its so deadly at least 12 cases dies per day where it is massively spreading .
I loved the comment below mine .üòÇ </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Guess who has a soar throat... MEeEEeeEüòîüòÄ </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> This is the sort of rhetoric that we need in journalism! People don't understand that the facts of an argument aren't necessarily pursuasive. You have to present them in a pursuasive way, like showing specific cases of the loss felt by individuals. "Hundreds of thousands are dying" is not as pursuasive in general as showing people that Domingo's family will never laugh with him and enjoy a day out with him again.  Where he was, there will always be a hole left and a new normal built around it from the tears of his posterity. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> It's a VERY deadly virus..and quite cunning and stealthy.  I know a person who ended their own life by carbon monoxide poisoning in their garage. Their death cert reads as cause of death..Covid 19. Apparently Covid was hiding in the back seat of their car....then sprung forth and asphyxiated this person. Watch your backs people. </COMMENT 20>

Depuis mars en france, les morts de la grippe saisonni√®re, AVC et cancer sont comptabilis√©s dans votre covid. Arr√™tez de mentir continuellement.

<COMMENT 1> Some of you have noticed an error in this film. We incorrectly used footage of South Korea when talking about China. Thank you for flagging our mistake‚Äîa corrected version of the film is being uploaded. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Paying with my phone? Never. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> I am not an economist, and I am not an expert of anything. This is what it is actually happening and this is the way we are going to go worldwide. Things for a few years or more will get much worse for all of us before it will get better. On one side the oil price collapse has taken trillions out of the world economy. The Corona Virus scare and subsequent lock down are taking additional trillions out of the world economy, The ICE auto industry is in coma, same for the aircraft industry, the tourist industry is adding to the great misery upon us. Billion jobs will be lost in the next few years, the stock market will come crashing down to a very severe level. Will it be the end of it all then ? Nope, but it will be the start of a new much better economy based not oil, but on free solar energy and other renewable. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> After an evil a million others follow. The imminent collapse of U.S.A as a superpower is bad news. To me they have failed in many aspects of their lives. China taking over is even worse... </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> China says you buy everything from us and fund our military today we will take back everything tomorrow by FORCE! </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> americans are way to scared of Chinese! </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> China is just a developing country, we still have many poor people, and our technology can‚Äôt be compared with that of the United States. We really don‚Äôt compare it anymore. We recognize the status of the world leader in the United States, the second in the world in the European Union, and the third in Japan. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> To answer the question that the title of this video is;
YES. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Obvious a biased video...in favor of China... </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Based on the video, China use COVID-19 as tool to gain power in the world. 
So now we know who plan to attract to human. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> The citizens of the world begin to realize that U.S.A. Doesn‚Äôt want co-operation with other nations, but rather to control the other nations. That is the reason U.S.A. Is falling. No reason to loyal to them in crisis. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Crush this corrupted country go china üëç </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Incomplete analysis </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> I hope Economist is not bought by China . all main stream medias are now working for China because of their FDI </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> We will become a cashless society after our economy collapses. One world order mark of the beast . World wide collapse all parts of the world. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> China has 3 trillions debt despite 4 trillion foreign reserve. Hald of the residual 1 trillion    was reserved for foreign company to withdraw in China, so really left with 400 to 500 billions to navigate 1.4 billion with 10k GDP per capita through this chaotic times, including flooding, locust attack, trade war, virus shut down, high unemployments, and corruptions. Perhaps a political regime change may improve China's economy. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> If the economist can‚Äôt tell Korea footage apart from China, would you trust its analysis? </COMMENT 17>

<COMMENT 20> Brazil has a big problem in favelas, what we can see is that people there keeps having children year by year, even knowing that they can afford to give to them a better life, they already lives in a hard life in favelas, I don't understand that, in only one small house lives 5 or 7 people, Brazil needs a way how to have  manage about it, the government gives support to this families with Bolsa Fam√≠lia, which is a project to give money to families who need it to raise they children, if you have 1, 2 or 3 children you will receive money by each one of them, but there's no limit for that, and most people have children because they know they will receive this money, however this money is so few that you can't even pay for your children's food.
So I don't understand why people in favelas keep having children knowing that they won't have a good life there. </COMMENT 20>

Calling around, none of the assisted care facilities or nursing homes have any clue for when they will receive testing for staff and residents, or when they will be able to open for face to face visitation rights!! Why does this not surprise me?! This is laughable.. You lock them up for their protection, yet keeping them from their loved ones is killing them faster than your spooky little bug ever could. Free the senior citizens... Enough with the games!!

Why are some of the US' top scientists making a specious argument about the natural origin of SARS-CoV-2?

1. ¬†I know about biological warfare/biodefense. ¬†I am the first person in the world (according to publicly available literature) to have analyzed an epidemic and demonstrated that the epidemic was due to biological warfare. (1992 study of the 1978-1980 Rhodesian anthrax outbreak, published in¬†Medicine and Global Survival, aka Physicians for Social Responsibility Quarterly (name changed), hosted by International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War). ¬†

https://www.ippnw.org/pdf/mgs/psr-2-4-nass.pdf


2. ¬†Prior to genetic engineering techniques being developed (1973) and widely used (since late 1970s), more ‚Äòprimitive‚Äô means of causing mutations, with the intention of developing biological weapons, were employed. ¬†Such methods were used by the Japanese beginning in the 1930s, by the US beginning in the 1940s, and by a number of other countries. They resulted in biological weapons that were tested, well-described, and in some cases, used. Such methods were also used subsequent to the 1970s.


3. ¬†These methods can result in biowarfare agents that lack the identifiable signature of a microbial agent constructed in a lab from known RNA or DNA sequences. ¬†In fact, it would be desirable to produce such agents, since it would be difficult to prove they were deliberately constructed in a lab. Here are just a few possibilities for how one might create new, virulent mutants:


a) ¬†exposing microorganisms to chemical or radiological agents that cause high mutation rates and selecting for desired characteristics

b) ¬†passaging virus through a number of lab animals or tissue cultures

c) ¬†mixing viruses together and seeking recombinants with a new mix of virulence factors.   ~U.S Anthrax Expert and Biological Warfare Epidemiologist Dr. Meryl Nass, M.D </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> "Over 100,000 Americans have died and several hundred thousand now infected are slated to die as well and, were one to read newspapers, no one cares.

There is currently no end in sight and some scenarios involving reinfection are grim.

One hypothesis stands out above all others, one where Occam‚Äôs razor applies.

‚óèThere is a long and visible history of American financed labs studying the weaponization of the Wuhan Horseshoe Bat virus and little or no history of China having a significant role whatsoever.

‚óèThe Trump government has never instituted testing, waited nearly two months to lock down and has backed fake cures, junk science and made so many blunders that it is impossible for them to be considered either accidental or coincidental.

‚óèTrillions have been made by Trump political insiders engaged in short-selling equities, massive no bid contracts for COVID supplies or simply profiting on insider trading knowledge openly.

‚óèAll normal government oversight, from financial fraud to bad science has been dismembered through firing every watchdog.

‚óèWith the next big figure ‚Äúone million dead,‚Äù blaming the victims, blaming the Chinese, blaming the Democrats and seizing full dictatorial power in the process is fully underway.

COVID 19 may well be a naturally occurring disease but, upon closer examination, it is really a criminal enterprise with considerable evidence of planning and preparation." ~U.S Senior Military Intelligence Specialist Gordon Duff </COMMENT 15>

<COMMENT 4> All the best Chris. I truly believe Covid-19 has a deep message for us to step out of conformity, playing rules in the Fake play, take down the masks (I¬¥m talking about the different hats you are wearing in life, not the COVID masks. Discover yourself and be the real authentic YOU. End the betrayal of pretending to be somebody else. Living somebody else¬¥s life sucks out your lifeblood just as Covid-19 does. Time to wake up, make yourself the no 1 priority, pay homage to your body being your temple, and stand up for yourself. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> YES! I have asthma battle this at day 12. Its horrible having shortness of breath, inhalers do HELP, wish more docs could prescribe it to Covid patients, they do make it easier because of more width to the airways. MOVE arround to the limit you can if too much shortness of breath rest then do again...I noticed some people been describing their docs actually did that even if they had no asthma, I am thinking with instinct....Covid.....Lungs.... open airways,...inhaler....That way you could maybe avoid hospitalization in best case. I even listen to my gut told me to get out my prescription of Mollipect, its a cough medicine that makes the airways more open and thinning up mucus if there is any there. I live in Sweden, idk what this cough medicine is called in other countries. It contains Efedrine. What works for me might not be best for all, but some logic about open airways,
I been looking up so much breathing excercises, its like my insticts told me too. I had to force myself do breathing excercises even though tough and painful. I can now at least take deep breaths, still sore, little hard breath but so much better!! I think its a life saviour! </COMMENT 5>

<COMMENT 19> Please allow me to share the truth that we can all allow to harden our bodies against C-19. Though you need to realize that it is bio-engineered it has a fatal flaw. It is too big because they had ostentatious ambitions. If your body has ample amounts of Vitamin-C and D it is like putting the whole armor of God. Your body will be armed with the tools to destroy any such virus on contact with these two soldiers. The wicked powers that be want you to huddle inside and not get that sunshine on your skin, they say that you only need a minimum of V-C, they may even claim that it is poisonous at high levels. They are the angel of deception speaking. I will add one more tool Chaga Mushroom in any form, pill, tea, or chewable. Once a day will quickly reverse what ails your body from such attack¬† you need to reverse. Bring this up and watch the media criticize this as quackery like they did with the Presidents Hydrox‚Ä¶.¬† Lots of Love </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 5> So I looked up coronavirus deaths for New Jersey (where I live) and the graph for it wasn‚Äôt a curve, more like a mountain range so maybe we‚Äôre doing okay? but (we‚Äôre really not, stuff is declining but hotspots are arriving so) maybe we should try shortening the mountains </COMMENT 5>

<COMMENT 20> Dexamethasone is one of the components to treat viruses like cov19. But FYI Scientist Doctor Ruben Fabunan (Philippines) discovered Dexamethasone more than 35 years ago as one of the components to treat Poison Venom (Snake Bite), HIV-AIDS, and many more. As the coronavirus outbreak, the Fabunan family doctor already knew the cause of these viruses because they have a deeper understanding of viruses. As the coronavirus outbreak, the voluntary covid19 patients who tried the anti-viral injection were cured But in the Philippines, there are some forces who are trying to stop the development of this anti-viral injection, they even banned one of the ingredients for this Fabunan Anti-Viral Injection. Some forces are using media so that the will not believe in this anti-viral injection.  What they did, they went to INDONESIA and Head of the Health Department and some doctors supported the Fabunan Anti-viral Injection. This month or next month they will hold international meetings together with other countries to discuss this Fabunan anti-viral injection matter.  FUN FACT: Before the Fabunan went to Indonesia the USA and ITALY government, already called the Fabunan Doctors and discuss the anti-viral injection. Why? because they already knew about this before. In fact, the Fabunan opened a company in the USA before but the BIG PHARMA/Company blocked them. Research on your own for more details. Cheers guys! </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 1> So when  will places of worship be open? Amusement parks are open, people are flocking to the beaches more than in places of worship </COMMENT 1>

 Those people will not get fined
They will not face imprisonment 
It's  a new day lets move on! </COMMENT 2>

<COMMENT 1> Hubby and I are both sick and waiting on test results right now.  Thanks so much for the helpful info! </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Thank you so much </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> https://youtu.be/b_wxaHwJ0aM </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> I get really happy when you try to pronounce the damn medicines. Currently tested positive for covid. Wondered why I had migraines every morning. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> I met several patients in Arizona and spoke to them and asked questions and they are seriously damaged physically and mentally. They have after effects from shaking, trembling, shortness of breath, bruises all over their bodies, severe kidney pain and mentally they are simply scared to death from what's happening to their bodies. 
There are people also getting infected again and returning to hospitals after they already had the virus and were released (the second time is worse). People need to take this shit seriously. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Best thing if you dont have that i found is half a sleeping pill or tranquilizer- couldn't breathe or get air without that, tranquilizers relax the lungs immensely and breathing almost goes to normal ! old asthma hack </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Thanks and all my blessings over U from Kenya üá∞üá™ in Africa üôèü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Just got back from camping and the amount of mucus in my lungs is ridiculous, might be from dust and smoke but I'm getting tested tomorrow. Thanks for the video and I agree those albuterol inhalers are pretty sketchy. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> l  followed  and feeel much better. Thank you so much . </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Aspirin is better.. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> I am feeling pressure on both sides my back and lungs. Wish someone tell me what will help </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> I love yr video..especially gargled WITH salt </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Sir can we use nebuliser if breathless? </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> I had bad headache for four days, 98/99 degree f body heat, then got runny nose and mild sore throat. I don't know what's wrong with me but I'm trying my best with taking warm water, ginger and lemon tea. I also took paracetamol and cold medicine. I hope everyone going through this disease get well soon by the grace of Allah. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Taking a shower helped too. As soon as I stepped out. Symptoms started again. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> If I had it I never took a flu test however, my coworker and dad got neg flu tests. I didnt bother going to doctor. Fever started in AM by 3pm couldnt get up due to joint pain. Like a magnet stuck in place, headache, chills, sinus pressure, jaw pressure with no sneezing. Next day could get up but felt lowsy still. Then by 4th day dry cough up until the 14th day of when symptoms started. May have been flu? Main thing that helped me was on the first night I was able to get white chilli soup in. Staying hydrated helps. No stomach ussues. </COMMENT 16>

<COMMENT 2> Hand over mouth..

GASP...who would have known we live in an enviroment of pathogens around us? 

I wonder if they were there before covid? </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> WHO president:
Korea: spike in corona
Germany: spike in corona
China: admits at least 1 new corona case, so they are doing great... they have always done great, they are the best, we are like close friends, china even sponsored my election... so they are such great guys...
.
Did i mention China is great? </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Everyone now is paranoid. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> I think World must come out new method to clean our hand nomore with chemical nor alcohol sterra but with pure nature sea salt water see how the c19 reacted...... </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> I think we singapore must change our daily prepair eating pattern no more cold food and beverages but hot soap and gravy food like hot pourage ........ </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> The clips Are edited and do not show the movements in total of the first person " Infected". Results are made to mislead and frighten. In my opinion FAKE </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Propaganda. If your under 80 you have little risk. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> The who head also a big time CHUMP. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Fake news and lies </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Interesting video, What we needed was a part 2 to this video, We needed another set where his hands were washed of as much or all of the paint he had placed on his body then conduct the same study to see if anything shows up then we can see how well using safe practices work. i believe the  first set was to instill fear. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> And this video shows why masks are particularly dangerous to wear. Not only are they harmful to your lungs if worn long periods of time, especially if you have asthma, you can breathe in the virus, which is 120 nm in size THROUGH the holes of an n95 mask, which are 300 nm in size... And you can also breath it OFF the mask that over time gets stained with the virus as you touch it with your hands and you walk through aerosol clouds. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Should be thanking all frontliners and medical health workers for their service. They play a big role to combat this pandemic. Mass testing should really be done as soon as possible.
Does anyone know where can I buy Covid-19 Antibody testing kit? </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Attention Everyone. Whats with the lady from Adelaide who contracted COVID-19 on the Ruby Princess with her husband. He died and she recovered and was given the all clear. Well she has it again and our State Gov is not counting it as a new infection and treating it as an old infection. She apparently has been out and about. This proves it can re-erupt in a recovered person to full blown COVID-19 </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> BS information for dumb people. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> While this a great illustration of how easily fluorescent paint can spread, it leaves out the fact there needs to be enough of the viral particles actually in ones system. If there are not enough of the viral particles, then one won't get the virus. No idea how many viral particles are needed for the flu, the common cold, or for Covid-19. The video is over simplified. And another person pointed out there was more to the study as to if employees served the food, there was little spread. Watching this just underscores to me the importance of frequent hand washing. And probably continuing to go to restaurants that are not self serve. I've never been a big buffet person regardless of germ spreading or not spreading. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Bombshell Study Shows COVID-19 Infection Rates Declining In States That Lifted Lockdowns </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> VICKS KILLS CORONAVIRUS in the air and through inhalation!
Mankind made the same mistake a century ago, trying to eradicate an airborne virus with disinfectants & detergents instead of with eucalyptus oil. Only when they started using Vicks & similar remedies, the  Spanish Flu was finally contained. Simply blow Vicks around from fans & air-conditioners. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Can you guys please repeat the same film over and over again? I didn't see it enough the first 3 times </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 1> Memory list- genius.  The Economist always finds the most creative predictors.  The real numbers can't hide. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> 0:54  Why do the soldiers do that?  Won't that cause problems long term? </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> this is what happens when state takes over media and removes deomocracy .........i feel bad for russia </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> im typing from Russia, our government are thieves and liers who want to make putin a tsar </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> If Chernobyl helped the soviet union collapse, hopefully corona will help this dictatorship collapse. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Technically you can't die of the Corona virus if the government kills you 1st. ü§® </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Thank You President Putin for leading the Free World. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> I have a problem with the images... some seems not recorded in Russia ?!... </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Poor Russian doctors are dying like flies.  If you are Russian doctor, the infection is dose dependent.  If you get a small dose nothing happens and you get stronger.  If you get a large dose you die. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Interesting, Russia is deflating the CV daths while in the U.S. we'r inflating them. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Dear Russian people with all that's going on in the world why do you keep this man in power? Gauranga!!!! </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Wouldn't it be easy to compare pneumonia deaths with those from earlier years? </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Wide Putin what have you done this time. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> I‚Äôve got a theory that this has something to do with a covert war involving AI. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> these commies lie whatever they want. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> That‚Äôs because it didn‚Äôt happen it is federal government lie across the world. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Some of the information here is inaccurate. The vote in July will not decide anything about the constitution - its a totally fake referendum. The constitutional amendments were accepted and became part of the document months ago. Putin has already secured himself as president for the rest of his life. Official copies of the constitution (sold in many Russian stores) already include the amendments. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> what's really going on in China? </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Have you tried reporting for India cause a same situation is here as well, state manipulating the situation. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> The authenticity of data is crucible to provide the outlook regarding how to strategise the policies and future decision-making. Russia, due to its inherited authoritarian approach, is working to keep information under control. It would help to nothing but brewing the internal division and hatred against the government  just like it happened under Nicolas Czar II in 1917 and then in 1992 when USSR split up. Eventually, another radical revolution would emerge. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 1> As always, we'd love to include your questions in our upcoming shows! What would you like to know about the coronavirus pandemic? #askDerrick </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Covid 19 is not killing anyone. Wake up people. The death rate is given as .29 percent. Still inflated.  Italy is reporting only 12% of their deaths were due to covid. Still inflated.  This is a plandemic to get control and force vaccines. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> A patient with any disease that requires a hospital stay is given heparin because the patient is imobile, so should patients with Covid19. Flush with both antiviral an antibiotics. Oxygen to will help blood flow. Low dose prednisone for inflammatory response. Much the same thing you do for people with severe viral pneaumonia. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Sounds as though covid19 should be treated like a bacteria. Maybe Clarithromycin or a antihistamine like Desloratadine should be part of a treatment regiment. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Every patient admitted to ICU with Corona virus infection should receive anti coagulant treatment, azithromycin,  anti viral treatment,  dexamethasone and Oxygen which could save the lives of many people </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> A major breakthrough about dexamethasone for COVID 19 was announced by the United kingdom. dexamethasone and Procaine are the main ingredients of Fabunan antiviral injection by the Fabunan doctors for COVID 19. This is not a major breakthrough because Fabunan doctors used it for more than 35 years treating EBOLA, SNAKES BITE, SARS COVE, AND THE LATEST COVID 19 but it was ignored by the PHILLIPINES DOH, FDA, DOST. According to them, it was illegal to use for COVID 19. They padlock the Fabunan medical clinic and the license to operate was cancel. Many of their COVID 19 patients were crying. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> One thing for sure . . everyone's science is everyone science.. regardless what perspective one has.. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Are there coinciding possibly symbiotic entities involved always. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> consider a question why is the body temporarily sensitive to air oxygen or whatever we might call it? </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> I will algebraically leave out source of information as envoy .. but the source is definitely genuine </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> We have complacency that we understand chemistry biology and balance involved... We are extremely dogmatic until we understand the craving system of our bodies.. We have dichotomized in many instances that it is erroneous as a bodily system.. is it anywhere like the craving for citrus fruit of the sailors who came across the sea in our history books?.. Can major maladies be greatly mitigated or rectified.. if we would only follow them.. and not force food and fluids even water past our lips.. With an overly presumptuous extrapolation of nutritional conceptualism?.. have we attempted to transcend science itself? </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> If covid 19 is a bacteria and not a virus they wont tell us </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Opening early was the biggest and worst mistake in are lifetimes with no vaccine or realistic plans and now were going to pay for it unfortunately </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> why film during an autopsy, if you blur the video material? </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> How long do you believe this Covid19 will last in the world? Could we be infected till 2023? </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> or you can be givenARBIDOL-umifenovir from day one and save all this DRAMA!!!!.....proved to treat all viruses.sold in Russia(was ussr) since the 70's.was given to children with no problems.russia has proven results for the last 40 years.........but its a question of money, isnt it?who is going to get the billions..........the world needs to wake up now </COMMENT 16>

<COMMENT 9> hablas espa√±ol? </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Monkey experiments are of essential importance. Because you can't use virus to challenge the vaccinated people, it's better to do it on monkeys first. Now none of the vaccine candidates shows promising results on this aspect. 
Antibodies in your system help you to response to virus quicker. No result shows that if you are infected once, you are immune to COVID19 </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Keep up your working, we are so proud of your all people science. The world hope for all science to save the world and with jesus christ the son of God. Amen </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> There has never been a successful vaccine for a coronavirus, what makes you all think it will be different this time lol </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Make the world hot </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> The comments on here make it sound like the vaccine is being developed by angels. They're in a race to develop a vaccine to make money ‚Ç¨¬£‚Ç¨¬£‚Ç¨¬£‚Ç¨¬£‚Ç¨¬£‚Ç¨¬£‚Ç¨¬£‚Ç¨¬£. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Good deed to help will never be unnoticed,,, God Bless you all </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> We CAN‚ÄôT CURE AIDS, or even the common cold (another Coronavirus), and yet, we‚Äôre all eagerly waiting for a CCP VIRUS vaccine that may never come. My money is on ANTIBODY treatments, especially since sick patients may not have the time to benefit from a vaccine stimulating an immune response before the patient dies. Antibody injection SKIPS the ‚Äúimmune response‚Äù latency period.
Oh, and I have ZERO CONFIDENCE in the WHO, also known as CHINA‚ÄôS LAPDOG, to be looking out for the ‚Äúbest interests of the world‚Äù at this point. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> I heard that "Haste makes Waste." So rushing to create a vaccine to a virus that isn't even naturally viral to humans is retarded and a waste of our current finances. </COMMENT 17>

 When covid-19 enters anyone in 2016

 What is the difference between covid-19 at the level of ACE-2 receivers before and after 2019?
 The common perception that mutations occur at the level of nuclear RNA?

<DESCRIPTION> As lockdown measures are lifted, many parts of the world are feeling a sense of relief. But experts warn of a second, possibly worse wave of the coronavirus. </DESCRIPTION>

<COMMENT 1> We are once again asking you to ask us: Do you have any question about the coronavirus crisis or COVID-19? #askDerrick </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> This whole talking about ‚Äòsecond wave happenings‚Äô as ‚Äòfact‚Äô is typical of the manifestation programming techniques used by the elites. James Corbett talked about this ‚Äòpandemic‚Äô being rolled out way back in 2008. He suggests the more deadly (but not so spreadable) Anthrax will be used in isolated areas to being about heightened terror + new lock down measures as confirmation of the ‚Äòsecond wave‚Äô. Halloween or early November time would be my guess - enough time for people to relive their previously normal lives, with some new shoots of economic recovery coming through - then BAM! - a long isolated winter comes and the greatest impact to western societies will occur. Folk will literally be begging for vaccinations - believing that will help. Just another theory...with as much credibility as this video. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> The second wave better NOT cause a second lockdown, I'm not letting the government take my life away again. We have rights! </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Wave 2 is coming! Lockdowns are being eased to make it happen! I'm sticking up on hand gels vitamin C and food items. It's coming soon after summer! </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> What will be with third wave? </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Looks like a Tsunami??? </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> the second wave will look like a hand moving through the air side to side ,,,  just like the first one </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Listen mate you people invent the dam thing and make money out of it It Comes by you people in the lab creating it that's how it comes </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Please stop spreading news and panic like this!!! Second wave will not be, virus will always be there and some people will die. Better make news about economic situation caused with lockdowns, losen jobs, poverti and people which will die of hunger caused by this situation. Also reportage about suspicions of WHO's would be great. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> All this because china eats bats </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> This anchor should be fired. He is too excited with the possibility of a second wave. </COMMENT 11>

<COMMENT 13> Anyone thinks the host has the joker smirk? </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> *PLANDEMIC* *2* </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Opening early was the biggest and worst mistake in are lifetimes with no vaccine or realistic plans and now were going to pay for it unfortunately </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Its coming and loves that were being cocky and complacent like are dumb leader </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Because they are planning it. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Second wave of lies wake up everyone!!!!! </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> WHO is a joke </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> And I saw, and look! a pale horse,  and the one seated on it had the name Death. And the Grave  was closely following him. And authority was given them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with a long sword and with food shortage  and with  Deadly Plague and by the wild beasts of the earth."

<COMMENT 3> What so many Americans are doing to there health care workers is just wrong.  They Dont care to social distance or wear masks, there running around protesting without a care in the world and its putting so much strain and stress on the doctors and nurses. The health care workers are putting there own health and there family health on the line treating these people, and they deserve respects. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Red states are BAD!!! how dare they open again for the business?
that is why  they told us 3 months ago that the second wave is coming, it is their plan to keep us locked down for business until we all get Bill's special 666 quantum dot tattoo vaccines so that we can buy and sell and travel and stop social distancing and stop wearing submission masks and other MINOR STUFF like LIVE our lives again.
So many hacks are "debunking" right now on social media something that is based on EVIDENCE... for example documentary PLANDEMIC provides that evidence from a resercher who worked in Fauci's den of vipers. If this documentary was really "debunkable" there would be NO NEED for Youtube, Facebook and other social media outlets to BAN the video, would it???????? 
This documentary have exposed the WHO, CDC, Gates, Fauci, CPP, UN and all other Big Pharma criminals and what is hiding behind the coronavirus.
Term *conspiracy theory* was invented by CIA to discredit those people that 
researched what really happened with murder of JFK. 
Affix the label "conspiracy theorist" to someone for daring to ask the questions, say about coronavirus, 
and majority would believe that anyone questioning it is a loony, they would then attack that person, because, why would our government lie to us?
We all know that they NEVER LIE?!
BTW, you cannot "debunk" something that is easily proven to be *true*. 
This exactly WHY so many paid hacks are right now trying to *debunk* this *Plandemic* documentary because it exposes the truth.
here is the link to this documentary that YouTube has removed* : https://www.bitchute.com/video/IB3ijQuLkkUr/ If they really wanted to "debunk it" they would leave it online.
watch it and then make up your own decision, it may save your life.
*Our world is ran by the cabal that conspires against us, it has been like that for a long time. *
Take a look at how someone who has a functioning mind can cut through the B.S. and lies that so many ordinary people, unfortunately, are buying hook, line and sinker.

<COMMENT 17> Nice  information </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> The array of severe symptoms looks more like ricin poisoning than any coronavirus.  Doctors and nurses: do toxicology tests on the next wave of patients (when they begin the "second wave") regardless of what the CDC guidelines say. </COMMENT 18>

<COMMENT 2> Long term effects?  I'll tell you what they are....gullibility,  unstoppable fear and anxiety, belief in the lies coming out of the CDC and WHO, and finally...the decision that the koolaid you just drank was as good for you as it was for the Jonestown community. </COMMENT 2>

<COMMENT 13> Hello Kate. Thank you thank you very well informative but let's keep it simple it's just the lack of the red blood cells carry oxygen I believe the terminology is hemoglobin something that's what I talked about using a malaria drugs so the after-effects you're talking about your correct is that the body still not used to what oxygen is getting and distributing it properly so that's why you feel groggy and tired and shity thank you very much for your very informative YouTube video but keep it simple people understand it better </COMMENT 13>

<COMMENT 18> humans are loaded with animal hormones from consuming animal products like meat and diary , prostate cancer is linked to high consumption of milk. So em it looks like they are long way to realise that all this is basically cause by animal meat but nope they all ignoring the fact where all this started. Lets say man with prostate cancer taking some anti-hormonal drugs is levering risk of getting virus as hes blocking all the hormones that are in his blood stream from milk and meat consumption . And again they found virus in meat marked , it is so obvious and so sad at the same time that vegan option of life is still far back behind even it basically destroying the earth and human life and only coz of tradition of eating animal products it will kill as all I'm telling you </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> I have more moles come up when recovering </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> I live alone and got sick with what I'm certain was COVID-19 after a trip. I live in Portland, OR. I had reservations for a trip to Asia, but after Christmas I developed a hacking dry, chest cough, so I canceled the trip. With the first episode I remember having night sweats and chills. It seemed that I got better, and attended a Christmas party. The was the last time I was to go out for a while because the illness returned with mucous in a painful chest cough with phlegm. I developed a severe upper respiratory infection, fever, headaches, and exhaustion. I couldn't get enough sleep and would spend the whole day in bed, day after day. I wouldn't let anyone in the house and I kept thinking that I was getting better. 

I felt my body getting very weak. I started having problems catching my breath, I used my CPAP machine while awake and sitting up because it felt good. Using only over-the-counter medications for the flu, nothing was working. I had an old prescription of antibiotics that I used for 5 days. If that helped, it was much. I live in a three story home and getting up and down the stairs without getting winded was seemingly impossible. The edema in my lower extremities was apparent, I wasn't able to wear my shoes because my feet were swollen. 

Whatever I had I knew was infectious, so I avoided leaving the house. In late January, once I got to feeling better, I was feeling soreness in the kidneys and liver, and I was unstable on my feet. The edema continued, there was pain in my chest, and sometimes my liver hurt. 

A trip to the ER included a CT that showed that my lungs and abdomen were unremarkable. Although lab tests were run, no COVID-19 tests were performed because they weren't available. When I asked the ER physician about the edema it was suggested that I wear support hose, and that did help my legs and feet. They are now back to normal. 

Today, I am a reasonably healthy man who is 70 years old, can easily hike 12 kilometers in two hours, and consider myself to be in good shape, and I'm stable on my feet. The residual problem seems to be an issue with my knees, not with the joints but with the muscles. With time and exercise I hope to regain my strength. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 7> I tested negative for both igM and igG that means I am or was not exposed to the virus, right? </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> What is accuracy of this test ?? </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Just going to say, this is an extremely unreliable test! It sounds bad but if you want to be tested you must lie about how bad your symptoms (if you live in the netherlands). Here in the netherlands we have an extreme shortage of tests because the government decided to put more money into KLM then into the health service. Most medical personel get told to lie about their symptoms or they're not getting the COVID test, although the dutch government promised that medical personel would get tests when they asked, that is a lie. You still have to lie your way into getting the test.
Though it is easier to get an antibody test then a COVID test, you still have to lie about how bad your symptoms have been here in the netherlands. </COMMENT 9>

<COMMENT 1> This is a very curious virus.  Since we're still in the first wave, it's way too early to predict when and if herd immunity will occur. </COMMENT 1>

<COMMENT 3> Bad leadership has cost USA it‚Äôs life </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Anyone else want to
Ignore the virus ? </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Anyone else want to follow trumps lies </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> I've learned one thing since COVID became a thing ... none of the experts know a damned thing about this virus.  It's all speculation.  Even five years later, all the experts will disagree on every aspect of this virus. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> herd immunity is not a fantasy.  Jesus...look at Sweden.  OMG, don't do that it might make sense.  Shit!  We a nation of sheep and idiots.  this plandemic proves it.  People are such easy prey.  Especially when there are only a few voices controlling the narrative. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> And you KNOW they're going to make us all pay and arm and a leg to get a vaccine if there ever is one. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> While I appreciate Dr. Haseltines' candidness, I would like to know what studies he is specifically referring to when he says HCQ is too dangerous to use, and that most people with C-19 have a heart condition?  If he is referencing the VA study they gave HCQ to patients too late in the disease stage - there was no way they were likely to survive.  The Oxford study used almost lethal doses of HCQ...and guess what?  There were adverse effects.  No kidding.  The Boulware Michigan study tested less than 3% of its participants to even determine whether they had C-19!  So I want to know, what studies he is relying on with his very authoratative statement?  There are other studies out there they find HCQ does clear the viral load if given within the first 5 days, faster than chloroquine or no treatment, if combined with Azith and Zinc  Please provide this information - what studies does he rely on regarding HCQ? </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Old school straight shooter. We are doomed. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Covid-19 is a b******* lie </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> So vaccine is the reality? </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> THIS IS A MAN MADE BIO WEAPON!!  THIS DESIGNER WEAPON SHOULD BE EXPOSED AND GO AFTER THE PEOPLE WHO ARE  RESPONSIBLE AND WE WILL FIND ANSWERS!  WHY DID FAUCI AND OBAMA FUND THIS VIRUS AND USE US TAX DOLLARS!  WE NEED ANSWERS.  THE EXPERTS ARE ALL LYING! </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Hahahha most all elderly already dying . </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Bloomberg markets is a fantasy too. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> 3:49 bullshit.  No evidence there is any problem for those with heart disease using this drug. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> They've been telling us the 2nd wave would be Released 5 months ago.
Don't blame the U S. Look for the real culprits, then do an interview. I bet it would go viral.
First of all it's not a disease anymore than a cold is, 2nd it's about the control forced upon us not the illness. Check your phone, Contact Tracing has been downloaded on it by Google and Apple. It's a total surveillance State being put in place. They will have a vaccine and you will take it, like it or not. If you're sick, don't wear a mask to protect me stay home, if you are wearing a mask because you think you could be sick and are asymptomatic go get tested daily. It's selfish of you to carry on as normal thinking you could kill someone else. STAY HOME, stop Your Spread. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> The mismanagement of this Pandemia by the Trump administration is criminal!!! When are people going to do something about it.. GET OUT AND VOTE 2020! If you can.. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Of course no second wave....sunami waves usually pile on top of each other. ....we have Covid19 and pure greed and deliberate ignorance on the other side </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> To be safe we need more fear... I see no one wants to wear mask or maintain social distancing. I hope I would have moved to some south east asian countries where people generally wear mask and are maintaining social distancing due to the fear. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 8> This is comparing apple to oranges. Nobody has done statistical analysis of the seasonal flu anti-body. The symptoms of COVID19 are much worst than the flu. What can be measure is number of people who must be hospitalized and, out of those, how many die. </COMMENT 8>

Rather than take precautionary measures - what the governments have been doing worldwide - they go about questioning it and the impact on economy! Yes economies have suffered, yes people have lost their jobs, but in the absence of lockdowns these could be far worse. Rather have my life than the economy booming and me resting under 6 feet of dirt! </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Thank you for being scientifically honest and not ideologically driven mixed in with fear. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Thank you for honest, intelligent insights/perspectives. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Very interesting discussion. Thank you. But I don't think I'd like to be in the US right now at all. I live in Switzerland and am grateful every day for being here, where the health care is excellent, the laws are functional but not draconian and the whole issue has never become some political controversy polarising the entire nation. It's been dealt with practically and in a manner that the vast majority of the country supports. It's called living in a democracy, and that has not been significantly undermined in this entire process. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Please do some research on Dr Fauchi.  He's on the side of Bill Gates.  He predicted this pandemic a few years ago.  I believe President Trump knows already. And, check out Dr. Raschid Buttar on YouTube. He knows all about covid-19. They are lying a out the figures.
I also heard that if you were vaccinated with the flu shot, n tested for covid, you will test positive.
I hope this helps yall. Thanks for the info. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> The truth is here for everyone to see now. Dr Rashed A Batter has been exposing the lies to covid 19 a must see on the truth. Thank you for this video, you to have questions like us, appreciate that you guys are honest.‚úã </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> This video is the most informative piece I have seen - thank you so much for showing this = to both of you...
ALL should watch the follow up Video as well..
I am pretty certain I had COVID in December and did not get tested at that time.  I was buying items from China DIRECT = person to person with a 9 day transit time.  I do believe I had it...  yes, I do... 

I would be more than willing to give plasma to someone that is sick.. however, it seems like a person that "think" they may have had it needs to have proof-positive before they can get considered to donate.. </COMMENT 15>

<COMMENT 11> Applying Industrial Hygiene in Treating COVID 19

I realised that since the government is telling the people to wash their hands regularly and the World Health Organization recommends the use of alcohol whether isopropyl alcohol or Ethyl Alcohol for disinfection,

I got an idea of using alcohol vapor to kill the virus inside our lungs by intentionally inhaling the alcohol vapor. However, this may work only for those people with mild symptoms since their lungs have minor secretion/mucus while for those severe cases it might be completely covered with mucus and the virus will not be directly exposed to the alcohol vapor. In order for it to work for severe cases it has to be treated with nebulizer first to soften and expel phlegm and that‚Äôs the only time that this therapy will become effective.

as a former Industrial Hygienist for 15 years, I know also that there is a safe level for airborne alcohol vapor since the nature of work of an Industrial Hygienist is to measure the concentration of airborne contaminant and compare it to the safe level as stated in the standard. Actually, we used to experience inhaling alcohol vapor whenever we are visiting alcohol manufacturing companies and imagine also how disinfected and sanitized the lung of the worker‚Äôs in the alcohol manufacturing companies.

The toxicologist will agree that there is an alcohol vapor concentration that people may be exposed to for eight hours without them sustaining any adverse health effect and this is called Threshold Limit Value(TLV). These TLVs are computed based on the lethal dose 50 (LD50) and by using some factors to convert it to Lethal Concentration then another uncertainty factor to arrive to the so called TLV. According to the Occupational Safety and Health Standard the TLV/safe concentration for Ethyl alcohol vapor is 1000ppm while the TLV for isopropyl alcohol (IPA) is 400ppm meaning IPA is more toxic than Ethyl Alcohol(Ethanol).

It may sound absurd but I am proposing to use this Industrial Hygiene Technique to treat the COVID19 by intentionally exposing the patient to alcohol vapor within the safe concentration or TLV.

I am proposing that this therapy be intermittent and should not reach or last 8 hours to make it safer especially for children and elderly since dosage is always based on patient‚Äôs weight and susceptibility and to allow the patients bodies to somehow produce antibodies by fighting minimal number of active COVID 19 virus.
The above-mentioned standard is applicable for regular adult without underlying disease.

Patient should inhale a maximum of 9ml for Ethanol and 4.82 ml for IPA in a duration of 8 hours. A plastic bottle with its corresponding recommended amount gradually squeezing and inhaling in 8 hours will definitely expose the virus in the lung killing the COVID 19 virus using the proposed therapy. It is not necessarily a continuous 8 hr exposure it may be done intermittently or the recommended amount further reduce to ensure safer therapy.

18 years ago there is SARS outbreak and then few years later there is MERS and up to now they have not come up with a specific vaccine for these viruses now there is COVID 19 It might take few more years to discover the vaccine for these viruses. For the meantime that there is no vaccine discovered yet for this COVID19 Virus it‚Äôs high time to try the proposed possible solution using Industrial Hygiene technique. Please see supporting computation below.

ppm ‚Äìparts per million
MW of ethanol= 46.07g/mol
density of Ethanol = 800mg/ml
TLV of Ethanol = 1000ppm

MW of Isopropyl Alcohol = 60.1 g/mol
density of IPA at room temp = 781.2 mg/ml
TLV of IPA = 400 ppm

To compute safe 8 hr exposure for Ethanol

ppm = (24.45 L/mol)(mg/m3)
MW
Therefore:

mg/ m3= MW (ppm)
24.45

mg/ m3= 46.07 (1000ppm) = 1884 mg/ m3
24.45

converting to mg/L ( 1884 mg/ m3)(1 m3)= 1.88mg/L
1000L
0.5 L per breath x 16 breath a minute = 8L/min
(1.88mg/L)(8 L/min) = 15 mg/min

to determine inhaled Ethanol in 8hrs
(15 mg/min)(60min/hr) (8hrs) = 7200mg

since density of Ethanol = 800mg/ml

7200mg = 9 ml
800mg/ml

Should not inhale more than 9ml of Ethanol in 8 hours

To compute safe 8 hr exposure for Isopropyl Alcohol (IPA)

ppm = (24.45 L/mol)(mg/m3)
MW
Therefore:

mg/ m3= MW (ppm)
24.45

mg/ m3= (60.1) (400ppm) = 983.2 mg/ m3
24.45

converting to mg/L ( 983.2 mg/ m3)(1 m3)= 0.98mg/L
1000L
based on 0.5 L per breath x 16 breaths a minute = 8L/min

(0.98mg/L)(8 L/min) = 7.84 mg/min

to determine inhaled IPA in 8hrs
(7.84 mg/min)(60min/hr) (8hrs) = 3763.2mg

since density of IPA at room temp = 781.2 mg/ml

3763.2 mg = 4.82 ml
781.2mg/ml

Should not inhale more than 4.82 ml of IPA in 8 hours </COMMENT 11>

I just signed up to be a test subject in the search for a vaccine for Covid 19 at McGill University in Montreal. Your teachings and my experiences have given me the confidence to want to face this. Can you give me any tips that will help me stay steady throughout the trial?

Thank you Wim, love you man (you‚Äôre an amazing human)

<COMMENT 13> With all due respect, a full scientific exposure to covid 19 to wimhof would be the ultimate test and would benefit the world if the results were amazing after </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> All the love, all the power. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> I don‚Äôt know about the corona virus but your breathing tech has helped me in many other ways, so thank you </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Thank you Mr. Hof your method has helped me with my pollen/humidity allergies. My nostrils have gotten rid of congestion little by little and I am now able to breathe and feel much better üôá‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> So why not make your course affordable to everyone? Even at 50% off it's $140. By now it must have paid for itself and then some. This is the only contradiction i see, but it's a big one. We need you, Wim. Be Love </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> God bless you all. Breathe deep and understand. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> If he catches that virus that virus better watch out! </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Oke, but in fact he says nothing. Yes, hes say a lot of time: "you can do a lot of things!!" "And you can do more". But nothing concrete!! Sorry, but I call this just cheap. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 1> Thanks for the good explanation <3 </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> This is gorgeous‚ù§
But Please improve the sound, it's hardly audible </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Can i use this video for my work. If yes that would be a really helpful. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> This video is pertaining to a person who has the virus, and his or her immune system is comprised of another infectious pathogen. 
Now, people need to understand asystematic and systematic, and his or her blood type. Not all can become infectious to these respiratory acute and chronic conditions.
Plus, there are Normal Floras' on the skin of a person, which can also cause some Flu-like systems. If the skin is exposed to certain issues like SARS-CoV- 2.
Not all surfaces can harbor infectious miro-organisms. This video is just a tutorial on the virus. Certain face mask won't prevent a person from contacting the gem. 
Damn, try living your lives, be safe, and stay clean, not paranoid. </COMMENT 4>

<COMMENT 6> People don't realize what the coronavirus test is:
1- it is very expensive (PCR), rarely done unless to confirm clinical dilemma and never as a screening test the way it is being abused in this case
2- No other disease has so many ways to test it like we're seeing for this Coronavirus
3- when it's done on anybody and is positive, it says only that the virus is there but it does not say if it is alive or dead, or doing anything or nothing
4- the person could be healthy and fight it without knowing (asymptomatic) or could have a minor case and nothing comes out of it (80% of all patients not cases)
5- the person could be a carrier, hv a mild case or average case or very sick but does not need to go to the hosp, or need to but only needs O2 therapy, or need an ICU, or be so sick that he/she needs to be on ventilator or die. To lump all positives as "cases" is absurd medically and inflates the statistics so badly the way it is done now.
No other disease has been dealt with the way this Coronavirus has </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> This committee head says out flat he does not like the president because "he lacks leadership"!
1- he himself lacks leadership by adding more division and being a bad role model of reneging against the president, having a bully mentality and being outrageously disrespectful
2- if it weren't to the leadership of Pres Trump, the economy wouldn't hv been been this strong, we couldn't afford millions and millions  of these expensive tests, wouldn't tv so many tests developed in such short period, we would tv had much more cases, much much more deaths.
3- the more transparency by the president the more criticism. Obama was just a talker, a monotonous one, and got nothing done. 
Here we hv a president who is keen on accomplishing things so efficiently, yet he is brutally criticized. I'm glad he doesn't like Pres Trump. </COMMENT 7>

<COMMENT 10> I update the following inforamtion on my facebook (Likuan Huang) with
the relaxing music (composed and played by me)
https://www.facebook.com/likuan.huang.3
-------
Humidity also is one of factors to decide how fast the covid -19 spreads.
You will find the fact that people living in island get less chance to be infected by covid-19.
The higher humidity ,less virus,dust are present in the air because of the gravity.

Ion will let the dust virus fall to the ground instead of float in the air because of negative charge.
Ozone can kill 99% virus bacteria. 
-----
Coronavirus spreads so fast. we need to wash hands very often. don't go to crowded place unless necessary.
  You can find all kinds of face mask on aliexpress.com shipping to worldwide.
  Type " 3d washable mask", you can find this kind of mask on aliexpress.com
Carrying peppermint roll-on, with you.(available on pipingrock.com ), apply it surround your nose.
Vick stick/inhaler is also good to clean lung  and sinus available  at amazon.com.

Old folk remedy - apple cider vinegar will reduce the chance to get infected from flu.
You can make some soup with apple cider vinegar, also apple cider vinegar capsule
available on vitacost.com .  I take 3 apple cider vinegar capsules after dinner every day.
Vinegar stimulates the blood flow and has a fever reducing effect.
It also boosts the immune system and helps waste products to break down more quickly.

I also take dole pineapple chunks (12 plastic containers/ 1 case).
The enzyme  of pineapple can reduce parasites in body/blood, parasites carry virus, bacteria.
Anti-rusting coating in metal canned food is not good to kidney.

  Wearing quartz watch may help to reduce the chance to get infected from Coronavirus
  Quartz watch is a magnetic pulsar too.  Magnetic pulsar will damage the protein coating of virus.
  Parasite zapper is a magnetic pulsar too,using 9v battery.

  Parasite zapper (15 Hz) is helpful to me. I wear 24 hours, It helps me to sleep deeply.
  I don't need to sleep as many hours as before . 
  One time I caught the flu with a sore throat symptom from contacting my husband  who slept 5 days to recover from the flu.
  It only took me about 4 hours to recover from flu with the help of 15 hz square wave
  zapper and peppermint roll on. You can find 15 hz parasite zapper on ebay,walmart online.
 

  Coronavirus spreads indoors faster than outdoors
 You can type "usb ion necklace" on aliexpress.com. wearing rechargeable
 ion necklace maybe reduce the chance to get infected by coronavirus 
 Avoid coffee , the food which has cinamon inside during flu breakout season.   




  There are sound waves posted on youtube to fight against Coronavirus 
type  Coronavirus frequency, you can find 4 sound wave.
I don't know whether it will work or not.
The following one is the popular sound wave for coronavirus disruption.

another popular sound wave  :

  =====
 You can find all kinds of face mask on aliexpress.com shipping to worldwide.

  Chlorine dioxide - CLO2  used to kill bacteria, viruses  in water or air.
I found clo2 card  to be weared on neck for protecting from breathing air contaminated by virus

 You can make for yourself cheaper than purchasing those ‚Äú  Air Sterilization Card ‚Äú
 cut one or two pieces of fabric, put clo2 -tablets or granules on fabric,
 wrap ,tie up with cord.

  You can find  Chlorine dioxide(from sodium dichlor) granules(usa)/tablets-from China (swimming pool supplies) on ebay or amazon
put 1 tablet in water for a room, ,you will see gas (clo2) coming out, just walk away
come back later , the virus or bacteria in the room would be dead.
move unfinished tablet/water in different room repeat the same process. 
   For slow releasing, you can put several tablets in plastic spice containers. 
 Chlorine dioxide(from sodium dichlor) will absorb the moisture of air,it may last a month.
   People with body dryness (including organs), dry coughing, easy to get thirsty,
 possibly  get more serious when having covid-19

 Eating pears/berry often to keep your lung , etc in good condition. (dole 4 cups of pear is convenient
 to eat)
 Vinegar removes sticky things easily, I wonder if sniffing vinegar would remove mucus from the lung. or not ?
I added a little vinegar into warm water, did colon  enema, and saw mucus.candidiasis  floating in the toilet.
  -----
    04-08-2020 I went to Walmart to return the items which I ordered,and went shopping there.
Next day, I felt my eyes, my mouth, my sinus dehydrated and painful.
It seemed I got covid-19 in Walmart. I knew the healing energy in the center of human palms.
I put my palms covering my nose, eyes ,mouth and started deep breathing  exercise until
my elbows got tired. I repeated 3 - 4 times. and that day, I ate 2 cups of dole mixed fruits
which have pear inside. After 4- 5 hours, I recovered completely.
    I heard news mentioning zinc will help to fight against covid-19. now the market
   is shortage of Zinc 50mg  supplement
   -----
  Uvc sterilizer box which can disinfect the mask and small items.
Type "uvc sterilizer box" on aliexpress, you can find those boxes.
Uvc lamp which faces up toward the ceiling is a good way to
disinfect the house. type "Germicidal UV Lamp 5pcs" on aliexpres.com
I ordered this type of lamp . only about 14 us dollars for 5pcs.
   ----
  News - Ivermectin which treats pet parasite infection can  
 stop covid-19 virus entering the human cell ,and kill virus within 48 hours.
 sold in pet shops.  / I saw on-line 1.5mg to 2mg for 10kg weight (farm animals pig chicken cow goat...)/
 -----
   According to UK scientist research.
   https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/coronavirus-mutates-three-types-experts-21845957
   Covid-19 is believed to have mutated into three distinct strains - Type A, B and C.
   type B is evolved from type A.  Type C was evolved from type B.
  It shows that type A - the original virus most closely related to the virus found in both bats and pangolins - was not China's most common.
  Instead Type A is now prevalent in Australia and the US.
   Type B is the most common in China.
  Type C is the most common in Europe etc.
=====
  I ran out of clo2 tablets (purchased oversea,tablets is more convenient)
 In USA, Sodium Dichlor Granular can dissolve fast in water , clo2(chlorine dioxide)
 gas coming out. I ordered 24 packs ( 1 pack/ 1 lb) from ebay, I  put a few
 oz in every empty spice jar, put a little water,make it look like paste,use thin paper towel cover  big holes of lid,
 puncture a few  tiny holes on paper towel.
 It will disinfect the air, kill viruses, bacteria in the air. I will carry 1 clo2  jar with me
 When I went out shopping. I am not sure sodium trichlor would generate clo2.

 A few days ago, I was bothered by mosquitoes flying  sound, so I put a clo2 jar behind me.
 Mosquitoes fled away. Yearly mosquitoes kill about 3 quarter of a million people in the world.

-----
 Eating more fruits , grapefruit,prune,avocado..etc, shit at least 3 times a day
 by doing this ,it will reduce the burden of liver detoxifying toxins from
 colon, so the liver has extra strength to defend the body against the virus.
 
 I ordered ozone device, it has timer (1 to 30 minutes), to clean
 the air(need to leave when machine cleaning the air), also can clean fruit, vegetable, remove remaining pesticide of
 fruits vegetable, or chemical from meat.
 
 A mini ozone device plugged into a wall (50mg or 120 mg/hr) will kill virus,bacteria.
This kind of small ozone device does a good job to sterilize air.
Ozone cleaner requires nobody,or no animals present when machine running.
Wait 30 minutes after the device finishes cleaning, and come back. The air
smell lots better than before cleaning.
 There are some usb rechargeable  mini ozone air sanitizers, available for some models
(2.5 mg, or 5mg 10mg or 100mg, even 200m/hr)  It is convenient to put on  any place in the 
House or office . </COMMENT 10>

<COMMENT 12> It amazes me how some people think this pandemic is a farce. Or that COVID-19 is a farce. Unless you have someone you know or someone close to you who has this virus and is in the hospital RIGHT NOW...FIGHTING FOR THEIR LIFE...then you do not know what you are talking about! There IS NO vaccine for this Covid19 and no influenza/flu vaccine will or does not work.  I know.

The idea of behaviors evolving by the good of the group is false. Lies and deceit is favored by natural selection.  Especially in humans, unfortunately. Behaviour, is a biological trait, only secondary is a sociological trait. This guy is spreading wishful thinking. Hopefully humanity moves towards the end of neoliberalism, fascism and all. Just don‚Äôt see the evidence. </COMMENT 3>

<COMMENT 6> You are biased to believe that human kind actually changes I'm sorry but throughout the history that I see myself it's very doubtful they humanity is capable of coming together </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> I love donating to charity And food banks neoliberalism is a serious issue i joined the lions club as a young member And they taught me how important to donate to charities homeless food banks clothing donation bins </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Virus? What virus? Don't be ridiculous! </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> So you ask why pigs? Pigs are the only animals that can be raised industrially for meat in intensive factory farms. They are omnivores and can eat any type of feed. Also, they have an exceptionally high feed to growth ratio. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Yes they need to be vaccined. Even if to had it or not . cause we dont know when its to come back again or not </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> We see selfishness during a crisis because that's what our paradigm necessitates. Competition, individual success, isolationism, those are all virtues our capitalistic systems reward and we've been so thoroughly immersed in that our whole lives that it's radically changed how we treat each other when stressed vs how peoples who didn't live under this paradigm would. But even in times like these, you see our human nature for compassion and caring shining through and people helping each other. And you see the correlation where the people who are most invested into our capitalistic paradigm and who support it the most have been consistently among those bringing unrest during the crisis and refusing to help others, meanwhile massive donation chains  to help those who are struggling have gone around in communities that have been trying to divest our world from neoliberal dogma. It's more than just politics, the system we buy into and are prepared to live under changes our psychology. If we've prepared our whole lives to live for ourselves and buy into the zero-sum game our economies have become, that will influence how we react when hit with stressors, it becomes us. </COMMENT 11>

<COMMENT 1> I believe in science </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> if there was a vaccine and the antibodies attach onto the s proteins, what would the virus cell do then? would it die..? </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> This is for anyone who is really scared of COVID-19.
I'm currently quarantining in a medical resort that only patients who tested positive can be there and stay for 2 weeks before taking a new test. I'm currently on day 8 after my positive results and I have ZERO symptoms so far not even a cough and my temp is very normal. I asked 19 patients who live with me about their experience and their symptoms and it breaks down as follow:
- 12 patients feel very normal and have no symptoms what so ever. (age roughly 19-33) (most of them passed 5 days in quarantine)
- 3 patients can't taste food and are unable to smell fragrances but has no fever or other symptoms. (age roughly 30-35) (most of them passed 5 days in quarantine)
- 3 patients has slight fever roughly between 38 to 38.3 and 3 of them has dry cough and one of them has slight burning sensation in the chest area. (age roughly 30-35) (most of them passed 5 days in quarantine)
- 1 patients suffered from fatigue, dry cough, fever and headache. He might have more symptoms that I'm not aware of but he looked quite tired to me. (age 36) (passed 3 days in quarantine).
and in my case I'm 27 years old and so far everything is fine. I make sure that I take multivitamin, omega 3 and Vitamin D every single day to make sure that my body is not lacking any vitamins. please note that I'm not a doctor/expert and i was not asked by medical staff to take any of these supplements. I just take them to ensure that my body gets what it needs to fight COVID 19. so basically i writing this comment to let people know that corona virus isn't always scary. It can be nothing for the majority us. And if you tested positive for corona please do not freak out but calm yourself instead and remember that most of people won't suffer like what the news say. Hope everyone have a wonderful day! </COMMENT 3>

<COMMENT 10> I think trust in a relationship is overrated. When my ex-husband started getting frequent night calls, I would ask and he would just wave off those calls as unimportant. At a time I could take no more of his lies, I decided I deserve to know what was going on so I contacted this great hacker Dr Nevetica via cybertherapies@gmail who helped clone his phone. All I did was share his phone number and through a remote link sent to my own phone, I was able to access all of his texts, calls and social media messages (Incoming, outgoing and deleted) which was how I discovered he has been cheating. Thanks to Dr Nevetica, I can now file for divorce.
If you need help or that little bit of closure, I advice you get in touch with Dr Nevetica on cybertherapies@gmail and I hope you find peace of mind just like myself after I discovered the truth. </COMMENT 10>

Audio at begin was VERY low. A few minutes in an adjustment was made but there is a constant buzz. Did that come from the podium?

<COMMENT 1> Di-methox 40% is what i used for my hunting dogs upper respiratory  problems .Such as kennel cough, upper respiratory infections. It relieved the dogs symptoms in 2 days </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> I lost a lot of respect for the scientific community during this whole pandemic. Way too many suppositions, personal opinions based on zero facts but on biases and politics. At the start there was an attitude that steroids could never help so why even try. We also saw a clear lack of understanding of biochemistry and mechanisms of how drugs work. The fact that these authors dismissed HCQ did not seem to understand that HCQ is not what stops the virus but it is Zinc that stops virus MRNA replication. But zinc cannot enter into the cells due to its charged state. HCQ is only a means to get zinc into the cell. I don‚Äôt understand why the authors of this trial did not comprehend that or were not open to test that claim. Did the studies and cases from France back in April mean nothing.?

<COMMENT 4> Covid sympton </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> It ONLY helps critically ill patients no patients with mild symptoms </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Dexamethasone is harmful  

would covid-19 get increase when Dexamethasone starts because is got more side effects than covid-19 do </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> I want to see Trump endorse this medication,. Then the media will explode claiming how this medication has no real benefits and will likely kill you from metabolic and immune suppression side effects... </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> DO YOU HAVE ANY PERSONAL PROBLEMS

<COMMENT 10> i'm in shock, guy üíê üçø </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> this has some weird things about it. first of all...this isn't how science works: an announcement is made via press release and then hours later the NHS approves this opinion for wide use. i'm sure we'll figure out more as this goes on. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> so this helps to mitigate the harmful cytokine storm response of the immune system it sounds like </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> This is good news, but this drug has a ton of side effects. Besure you look it up on the Web-MD site. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> I imagine American's are getting pissed with this double standard in news... Insert Double Standard:> President  Trump simply mentions a Immunosuppressive medication with nearly a 100 year clinical background  in killing viral infections which has been under review by dozens of studies within over 400 hospitals for hydroxychloroquine's effectiveness in preventing covid from becoming life threatening or in the very least, aiding during initial exposure, in an attempt to offer the American people HOPE  which many need, and everyone makes it a flash point to insinuate he's fabricating a global study for self benefit... But when Mike Bloomberg uses all the media agencies he literally owns  in order to sell ad space as they pretend Dexamethasone is an all encompassed solution, even though it's is basically just an allergy steroid that has over 200 patent variations, and doesn't actually act as an immuno suppressant which studies show doctors still have to introduce (IE drugs like hydroxychloroquine) . Ohh well.. time will tell. hopefully it works but Trump never said hydroxychloroquine cured COVID, he said its an immuno suppressant that "might" help and instead that statements truth has been stretched to the point of mainstream at one point saying he said to ingest "chlorine"just to mess with the American people's perception of truth. Fucking tired of the half truths, double standards, and yellow journalism. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> While this steroid isn't a cure, it will *marginally* reduce the mortality rate. Until a working vaccine is developed and distributed, I'll take any good news I can get. `The study involved giving 2,100 COVID patients low doses of dexamethasone and comparing them with 4,300 patients who were not given the drug. It concluded that the treatment lowered the chance of death for patients on ventilators from 40 percent to 28 percent, and it lowered the chance of death for patients on oxygen from 25 to 20 percent.` https://sfist.com/2020/06/16/inexpensive-steroid-is-first-drug-proven-to-reduce-covid-mortality-rates/ </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Treats sick people? </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Isn't ibuprofen an "anti-inflammatory"  and yet they tell us to not use it?  Something isn't right with this Covid19  ... it really looks like it's planned!! </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> It won't remain low cost for very long... The corporation can't tolerate such a low profit margin. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> I dont know where you got these numbers. The ones reported on the news in the UK indicate 1 in 8 of patients on ventilators and 1 in 25 of patients on oxygen. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> If Trump or a buddy doesn't own stock in it he will call it hoax just like he did the virus. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 3> Bolton the globalist war monger! </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Does the MSM have anything else to do? I can think of at least ten good questions to ask the Mr. Blackface! I‚Äôll throw you a bone. Ask Mr. Blackface where all this money is coming from? It seems the corrupt bank of Rothschild.......sorry bank of Canada is printing enough cash to fill the titanic, and just like the titanic, Mr. Blackface is going to sink Canada! </COMMENT 4>

<COMMENT 7> Test the app in Ontario; As if Ontario can be trusted to do anything right; I have a low level of confidence in all things Ontario; Ontario the Inept? Should be on their licence plates; </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> China must stop to  face to face brave indian otherwise have to face clash like 1967  and destroy this time and respect may be lost before world they give army tent to nepalise and try to revoke them against india that bad </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Going to start a drinking with Global where you take 1 shot for every time they use radical leftist slogans like ''systemic racism'' or ''privilege''. We'll be hammered by minute 5 of the show. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> You guys are so irresponsible reporting news this way.  100,000 people.  What percentage of Canada's population is that???? less that .5 %  And what percentage of these people are now better.  Are you trying your best drag this lockdown on as long as possible because the governments would just love to.  It not like a 100,000 people have it right now and even if they did, that's less than one half a percent. The news media is promoting this lockdown for some unknown reason.  And this ban on interprovincial travel in my opinion has tossed confederation  right out the window.  Canada is NOT the Canada I celebrated in 1967.  We were so proud of our country and to be Canadian then.  Now I am sickened by what it has become.  Every province out for itself.  Trudeau?  I won't even comment on  him or Doug, Yahool Ford.  Give a little man a lot of power and look out! </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Nobody cares just shut up already </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> The whole thing is a scam. Way more people die from heart attacks and from cancer and from drug overdoses and a hundred other things. No attention is given to that, but if one person get sick from covid-19 the whole world stops. Don't get me started on all the unborn babies that are killed or old people that are classified as useless, are killed off early ,but covid-19 and the world stops. Payday is coming. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> So in other words, 1 in 370 Canadians have the flu virus. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Yes that app will be a real help it seems </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> This will be a real balancing strategy for opening economy while we emerg out of our bubbles </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> I wish had non partisan news coverage in canada. Where the promoting of the lobranos about how incompetent Trudeau is </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> What a joke...manipulate the numbers... just over 2.2 million people have been tested out of 36 million people. So technically 1.6 million Canadians should have COVID-19 in canada with only 8,300 deaths and 85% of those in elderly facilities.  That‚Äôs 0.51875% death rate of the 1.6 million people that got COVID-19 and 0.023055555555556% of the 36million total population of Canada death rate...wake up sheep you are being controlled and manipulated. Most people don‚Äôt understand how numbers work let alone how they can be manipulated to meet the agenda of people in charge. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> I hate what Candas become. 
Racism is strong here 
Our history and way of life has changed drastically.   are streets ain't safe anymore . Now you have drive by shooting , home invasions, I know a man that was swormed by a bunch or guys that killed him with a machete for standing up for a woman that was being assaulted. 
I'm from Toronto , a city in paral. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> How many have the flu ? How many new cases of cancer ? And other viral diseases , this is the biggest gov fck up in history , trying to track the fkn flu , it‚Äôs already in all of us , we have trillions of viruses in our bodies already , and we are a virus , every human being is a virus waiting to happen , we are the only creatures on this planet that don‚Äôt belong here . This whole corona covid thing has been all about rich getting richer by selling masks and test kits , masks aren‚Äôt free we have to buy them , if there really was grave danger from not wearing a mask , they would be giving them away , just like they give needles and condoms away at most Heath clinics , heck they even give tampons out , but not masks , masks have to be purchased , Ford bought a boatload of masks at the beginning of this gong show , and testing kits , now they‚Äôre selling them to us , big time scam , historic </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 18> Hugo L√≥pez-Gatell, subsecretario de Salud, no da se√±ales de que en una d√©cada haya aprendido nada. Una parte de la crisis del AH1N1 en 2009 puede atribu√≠rsele a √©l, quien como director general de Epidemiolog√≠a de la Secretar√≠a de Salud, no reaccion√≥ con la velocidad que requer√≠a un brote de neumon√≠a at√≠pica durante marzo y principios de abril de ese a√±o. Tampoco fue lo suficientemente capaz para aportar informaci√≥n correcta al entonces subsecretario, Mauricio Hern√°ndez, que estaba proporcionando informaci√≥n err√≥nea al presidente Felipe Calder√≥n, mezclando casos confirmados con casos por confirmar, por lo que estaba tomando decisiones equ√≠vocas. La alerta tard√≠a sobre aquel brote epidemiol√≥gico oblig√≥ a Calder√≥n a pedirle al secretario de Salud, Jos√© √Ångel C√≥rdova, que lo cesara. El gobierno decret√≥ la alerta el 23 de abril y las medidas que se tuvieron que tomar para contener la pandemia fueron draconianas. A L√≥pez-Gatell no lo despidieron, pero lo relegaron a responsabilidades menores.

Hoy, L√≥pez-Gatell, el funcionario de Salud de mayor confianza del presidente Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador, lo est√° encausando a tomar decisiones tard√≠as y err√°ticas, que ponen en alto riesgo al pa√≠s, al mal informarlo y al desinformar a la naci√≥n durante sus conferencias de prensa para reportar el estado de la epidemia del coronavirus en el pa√≠s. La informaci√≥n es crucial para la toma de decisiones correcta, as√≠ como tambi√©n la reacci√≥n veloz que se requiere para contenerla. Pero como no lo hizo en 2009, tampoco en la actualidad. Los primeros 12 casos confirmados de coronavirus fueron dados a conocer el mi√©rcoles en la noche, pero desde hac√≠a dos semanas, ya hab√≠a recibido informaci√≥n de varios estados de una docena de casos de neumon√≠a at√≠pica. As√≠ como ignor√≥ los reportes hace 10 a√±os, lo hizo en esta ocasi√≥n. Avisos, s√≠ ha tenido.

El 27 de febrero, la Organizaci√≥n Mundial de la Salud y la Organizaci√≥n Mundial de Turismo dieron a conocer una declaraci√≥n conjunta donde dec√≠an que ‚Äúno‚Äù recomendaban imponer ninguna restricci√≥n a los viajes o al comercio, pero instaban a garantizar las medidas sanitarias para evitar la propagaci√≥n del virus. Desde el 16 de febrero, la OMS public√≥ un memorando de 10 p√°ginas sobre la gesti√≥n de los viajeros enfermos en aeropuertos, puertos y pasos fronterizos terrestres, donde urg√≠a establecer medidas de contingencia al haberse propagado el coronavirus a trav√©s de varias fronteras, mediante la detenci√≥n de viajeros enfermos, la notificaci√≥n de alertas, aislamiento de sospechosos, y asignar una ‚Äúcantidad adecuada‚Äù de personal capacitado, de acuerdo con el volumen y la frecuencia de los viajeros y la complejidad de entrada. Igualmente, propon√≠a un ‚Äúdistanciamiento social‚Äù, que significaba mantenerse en todo momento a m√°s de un metro de distancia con los viajeros.

¬øQu√© hizo L√≥pez-Gatell? No se han establecido hasta ahora esas medidas de contingencia. Para √©l todav√≠a no es necesario mantenerse a distancia, sin abrazar ni besar, porque hasta ahora los contagios son importados, soslayando el brinco de cero a 12 contagios en menos de 24 horas. Peor a√∫n fue lo que dijo el Presidente el pasado 4 de marzo. ‚ÄúLo del coronavirus y eso de que uno no se puede abrazar‚Ä¶ hay que abrazarse, no pasa nada‚Äù, dijo. Si alguien s√≥lo lo escuch√≥, no hay duda de que se alarm√≥. ¬øPor qu√© habla tan a la ligera? Si lo vio, pudo apreciar que el abrazo que propuso es el estilo donde uno se abraza a s√≠ mismo, mirando a su interlocutor, lo que es diferente. Pero en la continuidad de contradicciones, en la ma√±anera de ayer, L√≥pez-Gatell dijo que el Presidente es una persona muy querida y le gusta abrazar y que lo abrace la gente. Es una irresponsabilidad, de ambos. ¬øSe habr√°n dado cuenta el impacto pol√≠tico y econ√≥mico que tendr√≠a que el Presidente fuera puesto en cuarentena por estar infectado?

El Presidente tendr√≠a que estar protegido de infecci√≥n. En 2009 se estableci√≥ un protocolo de emergencia para los funcionarios del gobierno con funciones estrat√©gicas, y los aislaron junto con su entorno ‚Äìcomo lo est√°n haciendo los l√≠deres del mundo‚Äì, para evitar que se contagiaran. Incluso, la Polic√≠a Federal sacrific√≥ ‚Äìnunca se dijo‚Äì a miles de pollos que eran potenciales transmisores del virus. Hoy existe mucha frivolidad por como manejan la pandemia, y contra lo que hacen todas las naciones en el mundo, minimiz√°ndola.

En una entrevista el mi√©rcoles con Denise Maerker, L√≥pez-Gatell dijo que empezar√≠an a ‚Äútamizar‚Äù (elegir) pasajeros en los aeropuertos. No va a ser tarde, sino tard√≠simo. Por ejemplo, el reciente vuelo que lleg√≥ a M√©xico procedente de Roma ‚Äìcapital del pa√≠s que tiene todo cerrado salvo farmacias y supermercados‚Äì, se revis√≥ a dos pasajeros con fiebre, pero no se hizo nada con el resto del pasaje. ¬øC√≥mo sabe que no hab√≠a nadie infectado en el avi√≥n si ingresaron al pa√≠s sin que nadie siquiera hiciera una inspecci√≥n ocular, como sugiere la OMS?

El subsecretario dijo que no se suspender√°n o disminuir√°n vuelos, porque ‚Äúno hay demostraci√≥n cient√≠fica de que estas medidas extremas pudieran ayudar a disminuir el riesgo de transmisi√≥n‚Äù. En cambio, en todo el mundo se han cancelado o reducido los vuelos de y hacia sus pa√≠ses, porque son veh√≠culos donde viaja el virus. Los primeros 12 casos mexicanos, contagiados en Italia y Espa√±a llegaron en avi√≥n. La falta de control en los aeropuertos y puertos fronterizos favorece el contagio. Cuando se decret√≥ la pandemia del AH1N1 en 2009, el gobierno mexicano instal√≥ de inmediato retenes con detectores de temperatura en los aeropuertos. Al decretarse la pandemia del coronavirus esta semana, no se tom√≥ ninguna medida extraordinaria.

L√≥pez-Gatell est√° incurriendo en los mismos errores en los que cay√≥ en 2009. La diferencia es que ahora no hay nadie que lo corrija. S√≥lo tiene quien le aplaude, que no est√° viendo lo que se avecina. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> C√≥mo es posible que persigan delitos menores como vender j√≠camas, robar para comer, matar para que no te maten, narcos, carteles y persigan y no condenen, persigan y penalicen los abusos, altas traiciones, saqueos, asesinatos extorciones, opreciones con FARSAS como las de la influenza, el Coronavirus, para encubrir armas biol√≥gicas como la 5/G (la cu√°l produce el coronavirus), (mientras nos encerraron, pusieron mas antenas de estas, sin autorizaci√≥n de ning√∫n tipo), para producir genocidios
Debemos despertar y actuar por dignidad en todos los aspectos, para nada debemos soportar est√°s bestias

LOS VAMOS A LINCHAR MALDITOS, POR NECIOS
AMLO, GATELL, Y SU MAFIA, SON HIP√ìCRITAS C√çNICOS, ASESINOS, GENOCIDAS </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Ah bueno¬° Y donde esta la bajada  que tanto estuvieron diciendo lleva d√≠as en aumento de a 4000 casos por d√≠a y estamos en alarma, y sigo con lo mismo donde esto se salga de control  y los hospitales no se den abasto ag√°rrense porque va a ver problemas serios aqu√≠ la gente no respeta no obedecen indicaciones pero que tal a la hora de exigir. Esto le esta costando millones al pa√≠s y ya no se pueden dar el lujo de estar parando la econom√≠a seria la cr√≥nica de una muerte anunciada, las iglesias no deben de abrir en todo el a√±o en todo el pa√≠s, en el Edo de M√©xico insisten en tener las iglesias abiertas deben cerrarse punto, no es una actividad esencial claro esta para el clero si  est√°n perdiendo millones los par√°sitos y sin embargo si es un lugar de peligro aunque los creyentes digan que el de arriba los protege, las escuelas lo mismo si hay un alto riesgo deben suspenderse las clases presenciales hasta el pr√≥ximo a√±o y esto tambi√©n va afectar a la econom√≠a pero hay que tomar medidas fuertes ya independientemente de que la gente crea o no, ya la poblaci√≥n se le dijo lo que tiene que hacer ya es hora de que el estado delegue tambi√©n responsabilidad en la gente no somos un pa√≠s rico mis pejes ya el peje hasta acepto un cr√©dito del Banco Mundial y dijo que no iba a pedir un solo pr√©stamo en su administraci√≥n, el pa√≠s se esta descapitalizando y nos espera un panorama muy peligroso, claro esta a muchos de los que opinan estupideces no les importa. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 3> Those are two of the most serious Idiots on cable. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> I‚Äôm a Brit living in the U.K., I‚Äôm appalled at The Idiot In The White House, and I‚Äôm amazed he‚Äôs still in office! I‚Äôm thinking that things would be a great deal better if he‚Äôd acted immediately! Our government didn‚Äôt move too quickly either but they had financial aid in place very quickly which helped the majority! Chris, I‚Äôd never heard of you or Andrew before all this, and I admire both of you very much. You had an interview with Dr Gupta after you came back, which I saw but can‚Äôt find now! I moved me very much, and it was nice to see that lovely smile of yours! I‚Äôm glad that you and your family came out the other side, and my heart goes out to the families of those who have passed! </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> They clowns are so full of bullshit they are reading scripts please people both of them have no authority to speak on this they are not qualified.  Watch this https://youtu.be/MK0shLq9x6c </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Isn't Cuomo a Mayor?  And Dr Gupta is A gastroenterologist is a type of physician who specializes in disorders of the digestive tract. This includes all of the organs that span the alimentary canal from the mouth to the anus, as well as the liver.   He has no right to speak on this.  He's not qualified they are both fake don't listen to them as they studder and hold back their laughing.  They are full of shit they both work for Bill Gates.  Don't believe them it's all fake.

<COMMENT 10> u are exposed to the virus. What do u mean by." I have few extra send me ur address". U r allowed to take some time off wtf is he suppose to do.  come to work?? Stupid reporters. How much is gates paying u IDIOTS to exaggerate the virus? </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> When he talks about that he is scared silly I feel like I get this is genuine because on the other end Chris brother Andrew talked of him being so sucky sick and it making Andrew feel so vulnerably helpless to know hes of no use to his kids. That is family that Andrew ached to be of aid to Bella and Mario. He may be an older dad/grandpa but I have no doubt he loves passionately like Chris does. Have a book on my list to read that andrew wrote and kind of want to learn more about there dads history. There mom seems cool too. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Here is a reality check of one month ago. Weve done basically one lap. Weve gone nowhere really. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> We live with corona virus infections since 1960s. They cause very mild common cold. What is this entire travesty with  2020 COVID19 about?. Medically there is no problem this year. We had way more serious flu seasons annually. We also have 100 times more serious epidemics here - Cancer, Heart disease deaths, Deaths caused by unemployment and despair - suicides, drug overdosing, violence, depression, car accidents. To say at least. What is going on here? why are we in shut down? Anybody??? </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> What about if coumo had the virus,why he was riding a bike üö≤ü§îü§îü§îü§î,and talk and insulting an old man. CNN is a fake new and also coumo is a fake person. Liar ü§• </COMMENT 14>

<COMMENT 16> This dude all ways makes weird looks with his mouth! Dude on right, not Fredo! </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Cuomo is the biggest fake going. He didn't quarantine - that basement was his stage. His wife sure did recover in record time. When his basement performances were over, you can bet he was upstairs and around his family living a normal life. #FredoFakedIt </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> me and my wife are  recovering from COVID-19 send me one chris.  i'd appreciate it. </COMMENT 18>

Our numbers are looking really good and thankfully we have a Prime Minister that listens to the scientists and researchers and has been providing guidance and support as recommended in Canada. We are doing our best to flatten the  curve. And we are almost there thank God.

<COMMENT 10> The Cuomo brothers, Andrew and Chris, Dumb and Dumber.
Dumb is also known as Chris. His job is to misinform the American public every day on fake news CNN
. Dumber, Andrew. Better known as  Criminal Cuomo. His intent is to destroy the state of NY.
Highest taxes in the country, no guns, no fracking, no jobs, and if he had is way, no prisons and we would have illegals living in our homes.
According to him and I quote this idiot...  ‚ÄúAmerica was never that great anyway.‚Äù </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Chris Como you're a pussy </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> the stats are abundantly clear : if you are not 70 or greater in a nursing home or hospice  with dementia , heart and kidney failure or  end stage cancer you have little to fear except fear itself. Despite the media hysterics and very misleading misrepresentations for the vast majority its no bigger threat than the seasonal flu. All this lockdown BS is completely unverified pulled out the ass BS to appease the ignorant and cowardly . </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> I wonder if that's why Fredo felt good enough to go look at his house during the daytime and yell at a biker. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Has this clown addressed how he got busted outside looking at a house with a crowd of people while NOT WEARING A MASK???? </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Hey, forgedda about it. CNN drew straws and he lost? No he won? A symptomatic fake! </COMMENT 15>

<COMMENT 17> Cuomo's Covid-19 infection was about as real as his 100 pound dumbbells. Everything about Fredo here is fake. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Well let me be honest and straightforward to you and your brother. Both are a joke. your brothers decision about the covid with how he handled the situation was so bad killed so many people and i know all about it.

<COMMENT 6> She is literally reading!
She mentioned pretty high designation and authority for herself, but for simple information she seems to be blurting scripts in designed order. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Her premise is that it is a virus  whereas it now appears increasingly  likely that COVID-19 is an Exosome -  which changes the game </COMMENT 7>

AMEN. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> It funny to think how much she predicted: from face masks becoming scarce to countries' hospitals and becoming necessary to wash our hands constantly. She really emphasized how to face this issue globally..., but now it's required to wear a face mask in public (even if it does make our face sweaty). </COMMENT 18>

<COMMENT 14> Every person complaining about wearing a mask and how they have to stay inside needs to watch this. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> I am very fascinated by the infectivity of this virus.  At times, it seems to be highly infectious, with an R(0) far exceeding 1, sometimes even 2 or 3.  Yet, there are times where someone consistently exposed seems to have avoided being infected.  So, it begs the question: who is most likely to get infected?  Is it a gender issue?  An ages issue? A blood type issue?  Some unknown genetic marker?  There is still just so much to learn about this virus. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> this is so heart breaking but encouraging at the same time!  all my support for all first responders at the front-line. </COMMENT 16>

<COMMENT 2> Thank you for your bringing the best actual science and common sense I have been able to find.  You explain patiently to the layman and have A-list guests who do the same.  You have helped me sort through the chatter to stay current and make decisions for myself, my family, and how to be part of my community.  You worked through unimaginable exhaustion and shared with us online while things have been moving too fast to keep track.

I missed having grownups around during the community closures.  You and Dr. Yo are valuable friends and allies in facing Covid 19.  Your older vlogs addressing everyday health are also helpful and encouraging in these strange times. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> It has been used IV for covid for more than two months in Brazil, but only in the second stage of the disease! </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Dexamethasone I read that doctors prescribe this drug for altitude sickness which I assume is fluid in the lungs? I know nothing about medicine, does this enable the gaseous exchange to continue in the alveoli by pushing the fluid back into the tissues? </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> I really like watching ur videos, u seem extremely educated in medicine and seem to know what ur talking about and I also like how you just tell the facts and it isn't some plot or political agenda! Thank you for all the great information in this scary time in the world and for all you do!!! It gives me hope that we will beat this coronavirus one day knowing we have people like you out there fighting for us to get through this!!! God Bless and Stay Safe üôè </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Swedish Epidemiologist Professor Johan Giesecke :- "Why Lockdowns Are The Wrong Policy."
A man who is well worth listening to & who really does know what he is talking about.
Some direct quotes from Professor Johan Giesecke :-
"Covid-19 is a "mild disease" and similar to the flu, and it was the novelty of the disease that scared people.
The actual fatality rate of Covid-19 is the region of 0.1%.
At least 50% of the population of both UK and Sweden will be shown to have already had the disease when mass antibody
testing becomes available."
As of 5th June, 2020 there has been 391, 732 deaths worldwide from Covid-19.
Last year in 2019 from the seasonal flu there were 1/2 million deaths worldwide (with widespread vaccinations.) </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> What about hydroxychloroquine in combination with zinc n antibiotic for early stages? </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Doc Hansen - please look into the US Patented Fabunan AntiViral Injection for Dengue, HIV, snake bite - among other things.  This injection is a mixture of Dexamethasone and an anesthetic. It has to be that mixture in order for it to be effective. Family of doctors (siblings) - the Fabunans - have been using this for years and have found them to be effective. The sad part is - their country (Philippines) - have not given them a chance to go on trial. Please look into the patent. Thanks. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Are you single? Lol sorryyy üòçüåª </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> If I had a doctor I would want this man, he is clear, precise and uses common sense. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> According to the unbiased news, Corona Virus Protests did not cause any increase (i.e. spike) in cases.  The Experts did not anticipate this, therefore the virus is OBVIOUSLY smarter than we originally thought. It clearly does not spread with protests.  On the other hand, we see increases in infection for the past few weeks.  Logically, it lead us to come to the conclusion these increases can only come as the direct result of Trump  rallies.  Again, these SMART CORONA VIRUSES understand its collective BRANDING: the elimination of  CONSERVATIVES is the ultimate goal of the left. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Montelukast can reduce certain viral lung infection symptoms by 20%. I reached out to the man who led the researcher back in March and he said they hadn‚Äôt gotten ahold of Covid-19 to test, but that they hoped it could potentially help. It‚Äôs a common asthma medication and it is cheap. I def got a refill when this all started. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Doctors at my health care provider are using this and claim it reduces the death rate. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> All over aFLU that has caught the world out and they shall never admit it as would question the value of FLU vaccination!?------Exercise Cygnus 2016 findings showed that the UK was not in a fit state to deal with a coronavirus type pandemic and seemingly all corners and political parties of UK knew this but kept it out of public knowledge.
Advisors to Tory and SNP political animals broke guidelines they were setting for the public!
Advisors to Tory and SNP political animals spoke of deaths in the elderly and both moved elderly from hospitals to care homes and in some cases maybe death. It raises the honesty of doctors/NHS managers etc that allowed this and sure asks of the value of the Hippocratic Oath that they are meant to take!? </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> FAI is used in the philippines for over 35 yrs now using dexa and now being finalised in indonesia. Try to search about FAI (fabunan antiviral injection) </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Awit sa  and dost fda inuna pa mga sarili nila kesa sa kapakanan ng pilipinas </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> So, this treatment is only for severe cases, whereas if they survive they would have to lived with long term or even permanent health problems such as scarred  lungs and other damage organs. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Eye candy! </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> I  suspect its success not will depend not on whether it is effective or not. but whether it is still in patent or not </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Doctor Mike thank you very much for the information. But I have one area of disagreement. When you are discussing the different types steroids that we use you tended to seem to lump them all together and I think you also grossly downplayed how very very serious these drugs can be. Yes they can be Lifesavers in a lot of situations but they can also have incredibly bad side effects as they directly interact with the hormones and other systems in our bodies. Talk to anyone who is taking corticosteroids for a long. Of time and get their reaction of how they think the drug works for them. Be very careful when you are recommending drugs to a very very large audience that you make sure and give them both sides of the issue. </COMMENT 20>

And...mass testing, so smart, so helpful understanding the virus presentation and contamination! My only frustration is with the lack of opportunity for specific safer activity..eg: condition swimming...it is summer so...go in your suit leave when finished... access through a purchased pass. The chlorine will kill virus...literally no risk, yet not available! This form of exercise cannot be replicated in any other way and is impacting many people‚Äôs health. Local decision making on this not available to imput by the public. Snail pace response to reopen! </COMMENT 3>

<COMMENT 3> thank you so much doctor for ur incredible information about covid 19, actually I have a question ,i read about a case related to genetic mutation may be, a 30 year lady did not have fallopian tube and uterus but she had all other secondary sexual character like a women...nd after that dr.found that her sister was also suffering from this...nd she had family history ...i just wan to ask about , specifically which gene is involved nd more information.. please reply as soon as possible ... thankyou so much.. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> If BOB has type 'O' blood group, then his cells would not contain any of the A or B antigen.
Therefore ,even if his cells are able to reach and enter into girl's' bodies ( having A and B blood type) , their anti A or anti B bodies have nothing to bind to.
Moreover, their adaptive immune system will take atleast a few days to generate cognate antibodies against those cells. The rationale is not clear to me here!
Is it this additional load on the immune system that aggrevates the symptoms,though slightly? </COMMENT 4>

<COMMENT 8> So does this mean that type Os are more likely to infect others?
I wonder other benefits there are to O blood type. At the same time, I imagine that type O may have weaknesses that A, B, and AB types don't have. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Very insightful presentation. Hansen video endorses Darwin Theory of Natural Selection and Survival of the Fittest. Surprising to learn that COVID-19 terminally ill die of embolism and not by non-neoplastic lesions of the lungs. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> What about rh factor? </COMMENT 10>

<COMMENT 12> You‚Äôre brilliant! Thank You </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> I was trying to go along with the hypothetical conclusion you came to----no dangers in leaving my own heuristics behind for a moment. But tbh it was in hopes the definitely interesting but limited data, so far, was better than plausible mechanisms for why I keep wondering the 'how' multiple and complex mutations involves here for such a literally very novel call virus pops up where it popped up.

As soon as it had the cartoon of immune cells shooting down A @ B Ag's and, while they're at it, also shooting down nearby SAR-cov-2s </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Me and my son are type o. Got infected in march, in Belgium. We are both ok. A little fever, headheak, bruses . </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Oh goodie, I'm 0neg (universal Donor) </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> I think illuminaties are O+ blood group that's why  corona viruses are less effective against O blood group. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> i am having blood work for my Hashimoto's disease at my Endo Dr tomorrow and he said e would do the Antibody test i mean i heard that the nasal one if can be negative one day and then you could test positive the next so whats the best test is having the antibody test a waste? </COMMENT 17>

<TAGS> ['Coronavirus', 'COVID-19', 'Florida', 'president trump', 'campaign 2020', 'trump rally'] </TAGS>
<COMMENT 1> i think Texas will be the next epicenter of covid 19 IN THE WORLD..people are so stubborn, dont like to wear mask, and always listen to Trump saying that covid19 is a fake  kungflu </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Imagine not touching a single person for the rest of your life, we would all die by isolation + the fact your immune system gets destroyed if you dont come in contact with dirty things, cant be too clean guys! Just the way it is. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> In matters of health, it's certainly best to listen to the advice of competent physicians over any others. "One must obey the command of God and submit to medical opinion." ~ Abdul-Baha, Bah√°‚Äô√≠ Writings on Some Aspects of Health </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> 2 Weeks </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> President Trump must be planning a rally there !  Oh, what a COINCIDENCE !!! </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Just take care. It comes down to everyones actions as individuals more than anything. 
Here in Peru we quarentined early and have had strict measures for several months now enforced by the government. Mandatory masks must be worn outside etc... Yet its spread a lot here and the country is suffering... Its not the government actions what failed.. its the public. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Ahhhhhh florida is a swing state right? Hmmmm </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> They deserve everything they get. Go to a bar. But you should not be allowed to go to the hospital and put those workers in danger.  It‚Äôs fake like the flu stay home and doctor yourself </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> If I see one more "expert" doctor drone on about how we are all gonna die, I'm going to puke. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> But what this mean if I live there </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Florida could become the next New York State because of the rising cases, and deaths from coronavirus, and Miami could become the next New York City or next New Orleans, because the hospitals there would become overwhelmed. Florida could become the next epicenter,  very similar to the states of New York or Louisiana back in March. </COMMENT 11>

<COMMENT 17> Hay dos nuevos casos de Covid-19 en Nueva Zelanda, ambos viajeros que regresaron y que fueron diagnosticados en instalaciones de cuarentena durante las pruebas de rutina.
Ambos eran hombres mayores de 20 a√±os; uno vol√≥ a Nueva Zelanda desde los Estados Unidos el 18 de junio, mientras que el otro lleg√≥ de la India el 19 de junio, dijeron funcionarios de salud en una conferencia de prensa en Wellington que contin√∫a.

Eso significa que hay 10 casos diagnosticados activos del coronavirus en Nueva Zelanda, todos los cuales han surgido durante la semana pasada. Despu√©s de un estricto cierre temprano del pa√≠s, Nueva Zelanda hab√≠a registrado previamente casi una semana a principios de este mes donde no se conoc√≠an casos activos en el pa√≠s.

Pero Jacinda Ardern, la primera ministra, y los funcionarios de salud hab√≠an advertido durante mucho tiempo que la batalla del pa√≠s con Covid-19 no hab√≠a terminado ya que el n√∫mero de neozelandeses que regresaban del extranjero, a menudo de pa√≠ses donde el virus est√° desenfrenado, comenz√≥ a aumentar.

Los 10 casos activos actuales son viajeros que regresan; ocho fueron diagnosticados mientras estaban en cuarentena administrada por el gobierno despu√©s de llegar al pa√≠s, mientras que dos casos de alto perfil, los viajeros que regresan de Gran Breta√±a, no fueron diagnosticados hasta despu√©s de que se les permiti√≥ salir del aislamiento por error sin una prueba.
 Informa The Guardian.

Solo los neozelandeses, sus familias y los trabajadores esenciales pueden ingresar al pa√≠s. Deben pasar 14 d√≠as en aislamiento administrado por el gobierno en un hotel. Durante ese tiempo, ahora se los prueba dos veces para detectar el coronavirus, una pol√≠tica que ahora se pone en pr√°ctica despu√©s de fallas anteriores en probar algunos de los que dejan la cuarentena.

China report√≥ 22 nuevos casos de coronavirus para el 22 de junio, 13 de los cuales estaban en la capital, Beijing, dijo el martes la Comisi√≥n Nacional de Salud.
Esto se compara con 18 casos confirmados un d√≠a antes, 9 de los cuales estaban en Beijing. Las autoridades est√°n restringiendo el movimiento de personas en la capital e intensificando otras medidas para evitar que el virus se propague despu√©s de una serie de infecciones locales.

Los funcionarios de California imploraron a los residentes que usaran m√°scaras faciales y se mantuvieran alejados entre s√≠, despu√©s de que un n√∫mero r√©cord de personas fueron hospitalizadas con coronavirus durante el fin de semana.
El estado ha reportado m√°s de 5,500 muertes y m√°s de 178,000 casos, con m√°s de 3,700 hospitalizados el domingo, superando el r√©cord anterior de 3,547 hospitalizaciones establecido a fines de abril. Los funcionarios de salud advirtieron que si bien la propagaci√≥n de la enfermedad parece haberse estabilizado en muchas partes del estado, las m√©tricas en algunas regiones rurales del sur y centro de California son motivo de preocupaci√≥n.

Los casos confirmados de Covid-19 en Florida han superado los 100,000, mientras que los ingresos de Covid-19 en una cadena de ocho hospitales en Houston se han triplicado durante el √∫ltimo mes a 1400. Un alarmante 20% de las pruebas de Covid-19 en Arizona est√°n dando resultados positivos. Seg√∫n un an√°lisis de Associated Press, la cantidad de casos recientemente confirmados de Covid-19 en los EE. UU. Lleg√≥ a 26,000, frente a 21,000 por d√≠a hace dos semanas. Informa The Guardian.

Otros dos empleados de Trump dieron positivo por coronavirus. Otros dos miembros del personal de la campa√±a del presidente de los Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, que estaban en Tulsa, Oklahoma, para su manifestaci√≥n el s√°bado dieron positivo por el coronavirus, despu√©s de que la campa√±a anunciara el s√°bado horas antes de la manifestaci√≥n que seis miembros del personal avanzado de la campa√±a hab√≠an dado positivo. 

Sud√°frica ahora tiene m√°s de 100,000 infecciones, la m√°s alta en el continente, mientras que el n√∫mero de muertes aument√≥ a 2,000. A pesar del sombr√≠o n√∫mero de muertes, los datos muestran que la tasa de mortalidad en Sud√°frica es del 2%, mientras que el 52,6% de los pacientes con virus se han recuperado. La zona m√°s afectada es el Cabo Occidental, la provincia costera que representa 1.458 de las muertes del pa√≠s y m√°s de la mitad de sus infecciones.

Museos, galer√≠as y cines reabrir√°n en Inglaterra a partir del 4 de julio. Se permitir√° la reapertura de museos, galer√≠as y cines en Inglaterra a partir del 4 de julio, junto con pubs, restaurantes y peluquer√≠as, el primer ministro brit√°nico Boris Johnson anunciar√° el martes en un alivio decisivo pero potencialmente arriesgado de las medidas de cierre en Inglaterra. Informa The Guardian.

Algunas restricciones de coronavirus se volver√°n a imponer en Lisboa, Portugal, para ayudar a controlar los brotes. Costa dijo que las medidas que se introducir√°n a partir del martes incluyeron una restricci√≥n a las reuniones de m√°s de 10 personas y √≥rdenes para que los caf√©s y las tiendas cierren a las 8pm en la capital.

India inform√≥ un n√∫mero r√©cord de nuevos casos de coronavirus y un n√∫mero de muertos de m√°s de 400 personas en las √∫ltimas 24 horas, informa Reuters. Los 15,000 casos nuevos elevaron el total de India a m√°s de 425,000, solo por detr√°s de Estados Unidos, Brasil y Rusia, seg√∫n datos del Ministerio de Salud Federal.

Brasil ha registrado 21.432 nuevos casos confirmados, as√≠ como 654 nuevas muertes. El pa√≠s ha registrado 1,1 millones de casos desde que comenz√≥ la pandemia, mientras que las muertes acumuladas alcanzaron 51.271 el lunes, la segunda cifra m√°s alta de muertes en el mundo.

Los datos del gobierno de EE. UU. Publicados el lunes mostraron que los afroamericanos ten√≠an una probabilidad cuatro veces mayor que los blancos de ser hospitalizados por Covid-19, lo que pone de relieve importantes disparidades raciales en los resultados de salud durante la pandemia.

Los datos del sistema de informaci√≥n Covid-19 del estado serbio muestran que m√°s del doble de pacientes infectados han muerto de lo que anunciaron las autoridades, y cientos de personas m√°s dieron positivo por el virus en los √∫ltimos d√≠as de lo que el gobierno serbio ha hecho p√∫blico.

Tres miembros de la gira de Inglaterra por Pakist√°n dieron positivo por coronavirus, confirm√≥ la Junta de Cricket de Pakist√°n.

El primer ministro de Portugal, Ant√≥nio Costa, dijo que algunas restricciones de coronavirus se volver√≠an a imponer en Lisboa para ayudar a controlar los brotes. Costa dijo que las medidas que se introducir√°n a partir del martes incluyeron una restricci√≥n a las reuniones de m√°s de 10 personas y √≥rdenes para que los caf√©s y las tiendas cierren a las 8pm en la capital.

Corea del Sur confirma 46 nuevos casos, incluidos 16 marineros de un buque de carga ruso en Busan. La cifra es superior a 17 hace un d√≠a. Las infecciones totales han alcanzado 12,484 con 281 muertes.

Gilead Sciences dice que espera suministrar suficiente de su tratamiento antiviral remdesivir para m√°s de 2 millones de pacientes para fin de a√±o, m√°s del doble del objetivo anterior. Informa Asian Nikkei Review.

Arabia Saudita permitir√° a los musulmanes hacer la peregrinaci√≥n del Hayy a La Meca solo en cantidades muy limitadas este a√±o para evitar la propagaci√≥n del coronavirus, seg√∫n Reuters, seg√∫n la agencia de noticias estatal.

Las autoridades sanitarias de Corea del Sur dicen por primera vez que se encuentra en medio de una "segunda ola" de nuevas infecciones por coronavirus en Se√∫l.
El director de los Centros para el Control y la Prevenci√≥n de Enfermedades de Corea, Jeong Eun-kyeong, dijo que hab√≠a quedado claro que un fin de semana festivo a principios de mayo marc√≥ el comienzo de una nueva ola de infecciones centradas en el √°rea de Se√∫l, densamente poblada, que previamente hab√≠a visto pocos casos.

La isla de Hokkaido, en el norte de Jap√≥n, un popular destino tur√≠stico, propone un presupuesto suplementario de 367.700 millones de yenes (3.400 millones de d√≥lares) para impulsar su econom√≠a contra los efectos de la pandemia. La √∫ltima ronda de gasto fiscal adicional marca el mayor presupuesto suplementario de Hokkaido. Informa Asian Nikkei Review.

La segunda etapa de un ensayo de la vacuna COVID-19 ha comenzado en Tailandia, informa Reuters. Las pruebas en monos, respaldadas por el gobierno tailand√©s, siguen resultados prometedores de un ensayo similar en mayo. Si esta ronda va bien, podr√≠a allanar la ola para los ensayos en humanos en el oto√±o.

Rusia informa de 7.600 nuevos casos, lo que eleva su total nacional a 592.280, la tercera cifra m√°s alta del mundo. Adem√°s, 95 personas murieron en las √∫ltimas 24 horas, lo que eleva el n√∫mero de muertos del pa√≠s a 8,206.

Tokio confirma 29 nuevas infecciones, seg√∫n dicen las fuentes a Nikkei, por debajo de las 35 del d√≠a anterior. Muchos de los casos recientes se han relacionado con trabajadores y clientes en distritos de vida nocturna.

Tailandia informa tres casos nuevos, todos importados, que marcan 28 d√≠as sin transmisi√≥n local. Los nuevos casos se detectaron en cuarentena estatal entre ciudadanos tailandeses que regresan de la India. El pa√≠s ha registrado 58 muertes relacionadas con COVID-19 y 3.151 infecciones.

Las acciones de Shionogi subieron casi un 3% en Tokio, ya que el farmac√©utico japon√©s anuncia que se est√° preparando para producir en masa una prueba de saliva para el coronavirus que proporciona resultados m√°s r√°pidos sin necesidad de equipos o t√©cnicos especiales. Informa Asian Nikkei Review. </COMMENT 17>

<COMMENT 2> This footage shows exactly what COVID is like. It is clearly more like SARS than flu, and looks (and sounds) like an utterly terrible way to die.

<COMMENT 20> <COVID-19 TRUTH>
*Most people won‚Äôt get the virus.*
*Most of the people who get it won‚Äôt display symptoms.*
*Most of the people who display symptoms will only be mildly sick.*
*Most of the people with severe symptoms will never be critically ill.*
*And most of the people who get critically ill will survive.*

This is borne out by the numerous serological studies which show, again and again, that the infection fatality ratio is on par with flu.
( https://swprs.org/studies-on-covid-19-lethality/ )
There is no science ‚Äì and increasingly little rational discussion ‚Äì to justify the lockdown measures and overall sense of global panic.
Nevertheless, it‚Äôs always good to get official acknowledgement of the truth, even if it has to be leaked.
Here are three leaks showing that those in power know that the coronavirus poses no threat, and in no way justifies the lockdown that is going to destroy the livelihoods of so many.
1. ‚ÄúIT‚ÄôS ALL BULLSHIT!‚Äù
On May 26th Dr Alexander Myasnikov, Russia‚Äôs head of coronavirus information, gave an interview to former-Presidential candidate Ksenia Sobchak in which he apparently let slip his true feelings.
( https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/05/27/its-all-bullsht-russias-coronavirus-information-chief-says-of-virus-fears-a70398 )
Believing the interview over, and the camera turned off, Myasnikov said:
It‚Äôs all bullshit [‚Ä¶] It‚Äôs all exaggerated. It‚Äôs an acute respiratory disease with minimal mortality [‚Ä¶] Why has the whole world been destroyed? That I don‚Äôt know,‚Äù

<COMMENT 4> 'People die from firecrackers also, so why worry?' Karen, 48, while juggling live grenades. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Massachusetts went down on COVID-19 and Death cases so you people may ask why and how is this possible? I will give you the simple answer how we beat this for the dumb ones who still believe as Trump does is just a flue ok what ever Trump and the fools he follow this clueless President. It is simple in Massachusetts we obeyed and followed the 6 feet distance rule, we put our masks on in public, we are obedient not like the rest and this is why NJ, NY, CT, RI, MA, NH, VT, ME ETC. Among other states. So sad that we are going backwards because a bunch of knuckle heads don‚Äôt follow the rules I just don‚Äôt understand people. I need to go to a dictionary and just find out what these words mean in asociaci√≥n with current day people. ( Dumb, Idiots, morons, stupid ) etc etc etc....Today 6/25/2020 it went up to 32,000 infected. I just don‚Äôt get it.

<COMMENT 6> Don't worry, people with a mindset like them will eventually get extinct in the future </COMMENT 6>

<COMMENT 9> It's all good...they are all from the same family anyways. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> they are free to express their beliefs and free to answer the idiots question..... </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> You‚Äôve all got to be the stupidest humans alive. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Guess no more sweet home alabama in a fews weeks for these people </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Not exactly the sharpest tools in the shed there in Alabama. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Well you big bunch of dummies! Look what's happened now. 3rd day of the highest number of new cases since y'all decided to be stupid! SMH... </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> They should all be embarrassed with what they're saying. They clearly only care about themself. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> People are so careless </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Reverse Darwinism at it's finest. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> I'd think 25%of Alabama will be infected, maybe 3% of that 25% will be hospitalised and 1% of that 3% will die, so perhaps they are just willing to play the odds and spin the dice </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Alabama is a little bit inbred? </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 2> But how do these autopsy results compare to autopsies of people who die of influenza or other coronaviruses which aren't SARS-COV-2? </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> What kinda medicine/ treatments were they given? ALL MEDS have side effects! </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> How about food grade diamatous earth...8m really puzzle why this isn't coming to mind even of no one more knowledgeable than i am..... </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Interesting! </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> I really appreciate your video but like a person who has no medical school.can you explain all of this in common English because I'm lost. But thank you for your educational videos </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> The terms were too TECHNICAL for a lay man to follow. If you can use more common terms would be HUGELY help a lot of people having anxiety of this chinese made plague. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Two things the good doctor fails to mention: The number of deaths in hospitals due to ventilator use when contraindicated and the proven treatment trio of hydroxychloroquine, zinc, and azithromycin (which the WHO infamously tried to discredit by conducting a now-discontinued study using twice the lethal dosage of HCQ, effectively killing people to promote the use of more expensive drugs and potential vaccines}. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Your numbers are too high. Mortality rates are 0.01% in patients over 70 y. o. Italian and Stanford studies. See Lancet. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> So ya; this virus was genetically modified by someone on purpose... </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> UK-------------the undertakers must be doing backflips etc as having a bonanza year, if all is same they shall have had the normal 45,000 deaths and then add on the 40 plus thousand from covid during the lockdown time!? </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Question 
Does CBS have any effect. Any studies? </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Is it possible that older people are being more impacted because they  lack the moisture to shed the virus? </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> what is the result of this study ? is the virus that kills people or other complications ?? is it necessary to shut down the entire economy for this type of virus ? i don't think so.... </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Very informative and very different data than the insane-in-the-membrane news that MSM has been spinning.  Thank you. 1% of people who catch it die. And so far, in the US, 0.72% of the population has tested positive.  If that doubles at some point, then 1.44% would have tested positive, which means you have a 1.44% chance of catching it, then a 1 in 100 chance of dying from it </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> I still have all my organs inside me and I'm 66 years old I'm just suffering from diabetes I'm legally blind because I really need elected take care of myself it's my fault they listen to my body. I asked a lot of doctors one question is it normal for a person not having or getting headaches everyday or once a week or you know regularly? I'm lucky if I get two or three headaches in a year and I'm still concerned why cuz a lot of people I know they don't just get headache but migraine like my daughter-in-law was every day he's got a headache and migraine your friend of mine her migraine put her off from working so many years did he stay </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> I totally missed the IF YOUR SQUEAMISH thing thanks Doc üò©üíã </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Some of u people didnt listen to this video. We are made of flesh its not perfect just like how some of us have more bad than good gut bacteria and get sick from bad eating and living so does some of us are more sustible to getting the flu, the cold which is btw the corona virus, allergies, broncitis.   pheumonia. Stop talking about u couldnt breathe and this and that because  use to get sick before december 2019 with the same darn issues and u didnt die nor need a darn mask which is a muzzle the feeemason elites eho run this evil world gave to shut you up. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> I don't have the virus but hey if I was to die better dress me up fucking pretty. And bury me with my eye's open. So when my dead spirit is haunting the living at lest. I would look pretty fucking scary for the living. Haunting the living  should kill faith. And that my friend is worth dying for. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Last year this time millions where alive thanks to china so many dies  this makes me mad stop eating bats stop cooking animal's alive  stop touring this corona virus will take us out maybe we deserve it because tourcher off animals haven't stopped </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 1> What about the rioters who are shoulder to shoulder in protests, yet not a word about how they conduct themselves or the danger? </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> 99.99% of humans dont have this germ, but we need to sit in our homes waiting for Bill Gates id2020 chip, NOPE. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> The comment section is filled with right wingers and conspiracy theorists. Try working in public transit and dealing with people who don't believe in wearing a mask or social distance. Easier said than done when people say "obey" but don't deal with people who don't give a shit or are brain washed...much like the people in the comment section. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> NP...I will be Cancelling my subscription soon, and I will be telling everyone I know that you are not Trustworthy. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> I‚Äôll tell you what‚Äôs safe ! It‚Äôs safe for captain black face banana pants to get his lying lazy ass back  in Parliament and start answering questions Canadians want to know! </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> I only subscribed for the daily "deadpan" humour...it's the best! </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> It's still safe to riot and protest though right? Morons. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> You can protest have as many people show up no masks no distance. Yet you can't have a wedding or a funeral. WAKE UP SHEEPLE. It's not about the virus but about mind control and having everyone OBEY. There is no emergency never was </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Everything's safe unless you're over 80 and/or have prior morbidities. In which case, you should go into quarantine IF YOU CHOOSE TO. Piss off, NP. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> What about other risk factors? The bus you're riding could crash. The BBQ you're cooking on could blow up. The store you're shopping at could catch fire. There could be a forest fire at the summer camp you attend. 

You want to know what is safe...nothing! There is an element of risk in everything we do. From slipping in the shower to having an accident in your car. There are no guarantees, however, unlike variables we can't control, we have specific factors that we can control, when it comes to the Wuhan Virus.

We know that it is the elderly and sick individuals that are adversely affected by the virus. We need to make sure that these vulnerable people are protected from contracting the virus. Those who are not in a care home or hospital, but may still vulnerable, need to asses whether or not they need to maintain mitigation measures to avoid becoming infected. It is their responsibility...not the governments. We still live in a (mostly) free and democratic society...don't we? 

Let the young and healthy individuals get back to their normal lives. The Wuhan Virus has proven to be a more infectious type of flu, than the deadly pathogen that the media would have you believe it is. Stop pissing around and get our economy, and lives, going again! </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Uhm National Post in one of your articles you refer to Antifa as anti-authoritarian but they are not. They are authoritarian to anyone who disagrees with them. Antifa was started as the militant wing of the communist party of Italy. As the brown shirts were to the nazis, antifa is to the Communists... go learn some history. </COMMENT 11>

<COMMENT 1> The Republicans you Republicans have voted in want to open everything so quickly that our lives don't matter to them. All they care about is one thing. MONEY! They don't see that this thing is nowhere near being over? So many more people will get this and get sick because of their policies and lack of support. I have Covid 19 as I write this. What job do I have to go back to? Even if I go back, I'll surely be at risk of getting it again. We need to slow down the reopening! </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Dear Dr. I don‚Äôt know how to judge you as a doctor,  I think you are only a political doctor, not a real doctor for people, you suggest people not to wear masks for coronavirus. Shame on you! Because you arguing that because shortage masks for hospital staff. This is not a point as a doctor to say so, shame on your. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> If Dr Faustus had any sense he wouldn't be a leftist and a Hillary supporter...the little rodent just wants to undermine the President </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Dr. Fauci is a lying   stop lying to the people soro boy. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> The vaccine is to kill us </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> fauci is given false information so he can get that vaccine.  The mask is not helping people especially outside.   He is just a liberal.  Look where he goes to spread the false information.   He is just trying to scare people.  He is an asshole. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> In 2017 Dr Fauci  said there is going to be a outbreak in the trump administration..how did he know that. There is info about this man that is shocking to Americans. He and bill gates is always pushing for population control </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Dr. Fauci, sir you tried to tell about the virus, the guidelines, the spread of infections and reopening the country. I'm a teacher in Georgia. I'm not thrilled about the schools reopening, particularly with the resurgence of the virus. I was tested 5-7 business days ago and I'm awaiting my results. More people are testing positive and hospitalizations are spiking up! Regardless to what these politicians want! </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Here in North Carolina, we increased too. But it looks like people don‚Äôt take care it. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> If Dr.Fauci says wear a mask....wear a mask...he is wise... </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Those numbers are lies my friend passed away and his sister said the hospital called it a covid19 death </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> America hates you.....how does that feel? </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Please come face me like a man </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Lol with no masks on!!! I will beat the brakes off these cowards. These are all lies or protesters would be dropping like flies </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Come out from your caves and face a real man you punks </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> I will give my freedom to get a chance to have a meeting with you </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Please come and meet me and let me record our meeting. I can guarantee you wont do that bc you are scared of the truth </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Doesn't facci look like the elf in Harry Potter the one in the vault </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> So the virus just came out right after Epstein was killed and certain leaders of the world we're going to be exposed as pedophilias. Oh yeah that makes sense just like 9/11. Don't be sheep let's kill the goats and skin the wolves </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> oh lets see you think it was the protest that made this worse and why we don;t put our thumbs on it your kidding right i don't think reopening is at fault here  and why are people not wearing there mask just listen to news terrible job it doesn't take a rocket  rooter </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 1> Don‚Äôt forget, COVID19 skipped over violent protesters because the disease was scared of being racist. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> @minutephysics Who composed the music for the video? </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Geniuses like minutephysics put in so much effort, time and money into these well made, informative videos all for some retards to say "masks limit my freedom".
I sure love America! </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> I want to make an analysis like this for my Country (Costa Rica) but we have few cases per day(147 in a day is the biggest one) do you recomend to use a log scale too? Or do I use the total number? </COMMENT 4>

<COMMENT 8> Here is the graph uses on ourworldindata: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-cases#daily-confirmed-cases-when-did-countries-bend-the-curve </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> It's crazy how they're so many scientists, mathematicians, data analysts all around the world but none could demonstrate the data so eloquently </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> i personally think that the government are lying to us that covid cases are getting low but what they're really doing is making us calm which is stupid enough that we will get comfortable of going outside not knowing the person that we are talking to is infected. </COMMENT 10>

<COMMENT 15> It's sad that no one participated in the live chat... </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Yes the US is doing bad enough
We don't need help bumping up the numbers, anti lockdown protestors </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Thank you so much Henry. This was a very useful video. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> this is so stupid. it doesn't take into account so many things. like if china is telling the truth (which they aren't) and how much testing there  is. countries with more testing have more cases. that's why the us has so many more than other country's </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Believing in Chinese Communist Party is an insult to intelligence. </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 10> Renazikkklan Death Cult and their Murderer-in-Chief are having a successful pandemic filling body bags. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> If our government is worried about this, they're failing to convince because they are bringing people with C-19 over our borders and putting them into hospitals in Riverside and Hemet, CA. They also let the EPA take away the asthma inhaler that really worked for many people and gave us one that doesn't work well. The reasoning behind this was "to protect the ozone layer." How ridiculous can any reasoning get? </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> This is the first mainstream report that has pointed out the fact of "the devil is in the details" when assessing the realities of this pandemic. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> And nobody is listening. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Those hypocritical-disingenuous protesters are killing grandparents all over the world because they aren't social distancing - where are the articles about that? This Propagandist outlet said it was racist for President Trump to ban flights from China and is now trying its best to destroy the economy by pushing shutdowns until after the election. Every article released by this propaganda machine for the Democratic Party had a President Trump-agenda tied to it. Bill Maher said he'd love a recession - and the Libs thought that was a great idea. </COMMENT 14>

<COMMENT 18> Following Pearl Harbor, the government summarily detained masses of harmless citizens and legal residents in concentration camps as a mandatory precautionary measure.
Now we have large numbers of ignorant people who refuse to follow simple voluntary anti-virus precautions as a public health measure.
And yet, they will blame the worst economic crash in history on the governors, health officials, and on responsible citizens who tried to limit the damage and restore the economy. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Personal experience on June 15, 2020: 
HOME DEPOT STORE:  35%-40% of customers wearing masks, ZERO Home Depot employees wearing masks. ZERO. NONE!

<COMMENT 14> Leftist riots, leftist looting, and leftist mass protests throughout the entire country by the tens of thousands have been going on for nearly a month & a half and happily excused by you leftist CNN hypocrites as being a "necessity". But then you CNN idiots blame the uptick in Covid-19 cases on Trump's Tulsa Rally. Hypocrisy much? </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> i don't understand why people are having these concerns/conversations anyway...i vividly remember someone affirming COVID-19 was a hoax, umm at one of these very rallies actually...üòå </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Trump just wants power he does not care for his people I bet if the earth was ending and there where ships moving people to another planet he would only allow government people </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Saw the CNN picture with headline of "Tulsa braces for clashes" of a black gentleman looking like he was upset. Except when he was sent the pic by someone who recognized him, he was shocked at how deceptive CNN was! He was there in support of the rally and at no point angry or "clashing"...i hope he sues the pants off CNN. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Let them all get sick; then they can pray to god to save them for their sheer ignorance and stupidity. </COMMENT 18>

<COMMENT 1> Dexamethasone's been on short for months in Canada for cancer patients who need it already </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Wait I thought the lockdown was for people who had compromised or weak immune systems like elderly people but if people are dying via strong immune responses, sounds like robust immune systems to me. Can anybody be consistent? </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> A really interesting fact about the trial is that it was cut short before it was due to finish due to being unethical. This drug was such a success that it became unethical to refuse other people in the trial using other drugs access to this one. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> I have lupus and when I first heard of the immune response that seems to be happening with some people with COVID-19 I was wondering why they weren‚Äôt testing corticosteroids. I sometimes have to take this and other corticosteroids to treat my autoimmune disease.  Please do not take this drug as a preventative. People like myself have an over active immune system as do the people who are experiencing Covid in this manner. It will make you hate your life. The side effects can be extreme. Again please don‚Äôt take it! </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Showing LOVE for the SciShow, BRAVO Hank for another great but very informative video. It truly does amaze me how science is period. Have a blessed day to everyone. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Thank you for the very informative video. I would absolutely love to understand this: according to the WHO ‚ÄúThere is currently no evidence that people who have recovered from COVID-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection‚Äù. Firstly, do all recovered patients have antibodies? Secondly, if they have antibodies, why wouldn‚Äôt they be protected from a second infection? </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Ooor use hydroxycloroquine and zink before people get really sick... </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> When you are in this business you should know where to invest, I have seen many people who wasted their money in this business. One should know how it works and where to invest. A good strategy and manager is what you need to start making profits from trading, Mr *(Hedris robert )*strategy and robotic system guarantees maximum profits. From all this brokers I see doing this trading Digital currency, Mr Cortez is the most reliable, he manages several accounts and does it perfectly with maximum profits. You can reach Hedris via email: hedrisrobert@gmail.com, telegram:@Hedrisrobert </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> This is good news üíï </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> While it is good news. But this isn't going to make much difference. Physicians in many places are already using this. Dexamethasone is a known drug to mitigate ARDS, so no new news but the quantitative data will make some difference. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> The media in May: noooooo dont go out its super dangerous. We rather let 1000s of families suffer and lose their jobs than to spread it

Media in June: the virus isn't bad. Please come out to protest.

This isn't meant to be racist its meant to say the media is just awful </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> I‚Äôm sorry...did they not give a placebo in the control group...??? JFC WHY ARE PEOPLE BAD. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Did calculate how people the economic crisis will kill? </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> This is like an episode of Numb3rs </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> How has our efforts to stop/slow the spread of COVID-19 impacted the spread of other infectious diseases like measles and chicken pox? Any chance that we can eradicate diseases like that through our current efforts? </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> ivermectin </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Outstanding discovery! </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Evidence from medical studies conducted in other countries clearly points to hydroxychloroquine as being very effective but since the president stated that it was promising, the media and the jerks in the FDA decided to make it political and pulled approval for its use on Covid even though it has been used for DECADES to treat other diseases. This is not opinion but scientific fact. There are journal articles from doctors in Israel and other places to prove it. The evidence is there and clear, but thanks to politics, lives are being put at risk. I don't care if you hate Trump and honestly, I think he is a jerk, but pulling an approved drug to score cheap political points is evil. </COMMENT 18>

<COMMENT 10> I ran gas tanker for a while, home every night, odd time you weren't they put you in a hotel, weekends off, paid good. Only had to worry about kabooming. Now I'm running tow truck again, making better money but at the expense of my sanity. On call 24/6 </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> I like this guy </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Got my self out of debt living in truck and built up money to buy house cash </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Turtlewax that exotic </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> I was at dead end jobs. One day while i was loading this flat bed trailer i asked the driver how his job was like. I then became interested and got my CDL. My first job i was making 67k a year driving regional. Now im doing locals making more than I've ever made and i didnt make much back then. Its alright, you just drive and listen to your favorite music or audio books or Joe Rogan podcasts. Can't really complain. </COMMENT 14>

<COMMENT 17> I work at a truck center in the parts dept. Specifically we deliver truck parts all around local shops & trucklines and I can confirm, business did not slow down one bit. Our service department has had all 14 bays full almost every day for the past few months. The body shop has kept up with business too, and our parts sales haven‚Äôt dipped almost at all. </COMMENT 17>

<TAGS> ['Chile'] </TAGS>
<COMMENT 1> Vi un documental alem√°n que habla de como China envi√≥ mascarillas en mal estado a diferentes pa√≠ses y de su historial de malas vacunas, hay numerosos casos en China de uso de medicamentos y vacunas que dejan da√±ada gravemente a las personas... </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Que raro que en China no este circulando. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Toda sistema esta falsa.  Y esto es cosa mundial, en cada pa√≠s lo igual. Medicina moderna no cura, si desarrolla enfermedades cr√≥nicas y provoca muertes. Es negocio mundial m√°s grande.  Dejad de confiar a los m√©dicos. Ocupa de su salud vosotros mismos. Tened como hobby estudiar sobre salud. Tenemos info en internet. Para empezar los libros de Herbert Sheldon, Pol Breg, Yury Nicolaev ‚Äú ayunar para salud ‚Äú  ... En Espa√±a hay buen info en revista ‚ÄúDiscovery salud‚Äù  sobre mentiras de pandemia. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Va durar todo lo que dura lo chino , con cueva un fin de semana. Mas vacuna la vacuna jajaja , y nos vienen vacunado desde hace mucho tiempo ya ...pongansela a Pi√±ata si se salva me la pongo. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Van hacer conejito de los chinos yo no le tendr√≠a confianza </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> No entiendo, se supone que trabajar en una vacuna lleva a√±os, y la van a tener lista en unos meses ? aqui hay algo raro ,y hasta donde se sabe jamas se a aislado el virus ni visto para un estudio, paso </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> DEJEN DE MENTIR!!!!! </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Los chinos han probado la seguridad en la etapa inicial.  Esta es la tercera fase de las pruebas.  Es solo que pocas personas en China ahora tienen COVID19 </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> QUE " SE INMUNIZEN " LOS MARXISTAS  PRIMERO!!   CHAOOO!! </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> jajajajajajajaja me dan risa con la vacuna por que no hay nada y muy pronto se viene la cagada en todo chile abran los ojos los estan enga√±ando a todo chile y asi no mas la cosa kuek üò∞üò∞üò∞üò∞üò∞üò∞üò∞üò∞üò∞üò∞üò∞üò∞üò∞üò∞üò∞üò∞ </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Quieren vacunarlos con t√≥xicos que modifican el ADN, eso es lo que pretende Bill Gates desde la OMS, y la certificaci√≥n de la vacuna ya lo dijeron, va a ser un MICROCHIP en la mano y en la frente. O sea, est√°n adelantando la marca de la bestia (Revelaci√≥n 13:18 en la biblia). Y con esta noticia, les est√°n diciendo que ni siquiera los quieren envenenar una vez, sino que los quieren envenenar a√±o a a√±o hasta que mueran. No vieron la pel√≠cula "I am Legend"? Lo que caus√≥ la muerte de todos fue la vacuna, no el virus.  Es todo una farsa, es mejor llamado el CONTROLavirus. Esto se llama la operaci√≥n vacuna mundial y el microchipeo masivo con la marca de la bestia. Nunca han aislado el virus y las muestras que tomaron son de un pulm√≥n aleatorio, lo que es para la risa. Y la prueba gol estandar es el PCR, que dicho por el mismo creador NO PUEDE USARSE COMO DIAGN√ìSTICO. Por eso es que da 80% de falsos positivos. Y con las mascarillas y el obligar a la gente con problemas respiratorios a llevar esas mascarillas no hace m√°s que agravar sus problemas, y cuando consultan, le hacen este test chanta PCR y claro que salen positivos, los meten a esas m√°quinas de muerte llamados respiradores mec√°nicos que revientan tus alveolos, y listo, tienen otro muerto m√°s, con el falso "coronavirus". Y la OMS es un organismo del vaticano manejado por sus satanistas como Bill Satanito Gates que ha dicho desde 2010 que desea reducir la poblaci√≥n. Y claro, es a este organismo de satanistas al cual ustedes recurren y siguen sus directrices. Deber√≠an dejar de ser tan idiotas porque vamos directo para Revelaci√≥n 13 en la biblia. Falta s√≥lo el atrapado del cuerpo de Cristo.
Si se vacunan se van a morir en un par de a√±os, porque lo letal vienen en la vacuna. Y si se colocan la marca de la bestia (el microchip) se condenan eternamente (Rev 14:9-11). Si no se reconiclian con Dios, se van a perder el atrapado del cuerpo de Cristo, si se pierden el atrapado del cuerpo de Cristo, van a tener que pasar este tiempo terrible que se viene en donde Dios va a soltar al anticristo y va a lanzar las plagas sobre la tierra, y van a tener que entrar en el dilema de la marca de la bestia. Mejor se reconcilian ahora con Dios, su palabra es la biblia King James, y si no saben ingl√©s, busquen la King James traducida en youtube en el canal de final redemption, est√° con notas y ayudas para que se reconcilien con Dios. 
Ya estan advertidos, no van a poder decir que no sab√≠an.
PS: los gobiernos no quieren el bienestar de ustedes, los prefieren a todos muertos, el vaticano es el responsable de todo (Revelaci√≥n 17) y a quien dependen los masones, Jesuitas, los reyes de la tierra, el poder pol√≠tico, militar, econ√≥mico, los medios de comunicaci√≥n... es la gran ramera en la biblia (Rev 17), donde satan√°s tiene su silla. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> TREMENDOS TITULOS ESTOS WEONES INUTILES , EXPERTOS EN QUE MIERDA SERAN YA QUE NO SON CAPACES CON SUS TAN EXTENSOS TITULOS NI SIQUIERA DE ANALIZAR SU PROPIA MIERDA JAJAJAJAJAJAJJA . Y ESTOS MISMOS INUTILES HIPOCRITAS SON LOS MISMOS QUE MIRAN EN MENOS HA LOS MEDICOS VENEZOLANOS O CUBANOS , SI EN UNA ESCALA DE 1-10 ESTOS INUTILES CHILENOS CON SUS BIBLIAS DE TITULOS SI TAN SOLO APATECIERAN EN ESTA ESCALA DE COMPETENCIA CON LA MEDICINA VENEZOLANA O CUBANA SE PODRIA JUSTIFICAR  SU RECHAZO HA Y TODAS LAS TRANCAS QUE LE PONEN HA LOS MEDICOS EXTRANJEROS . </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Si es segura , porque no vacunaron en China donde hubo rebrote. ?. Claro ,,,, no arriesgan a la poblaci√≥n de ellos. Las  respuestas del pol√≠tico son pat√©ticas. Subestima al pueblo chileno. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Mi pais casi fundido y con miles de problemas economicos y sociales sin nombrar q estamos conbatiendo tanto el covid como el dengue ya ahiga varios desarrollos y hece pais q tanto hablanban q eran un ejemplo en crecimiento en latino america no haga nada mas q ser un experimento para otros paises como brazil a ustedes los vacuna china y a brazil ee.uu q raro suena peroantes de tirar mala onda averiguen q es verdad tambien lo de brazil nos usan de conejillos de india </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Que bueno hermano primero el presidente y su familia porque no le puso un atago cu√°ndo dej√≥ dentrar los barcos y cruceros que √©l sab√≠a que tra√≠an el Corona biros </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Entre vacunarse con esa vacuna china y que me viole un burro con viagra prefiero lo segundo </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Chileno o no hay que probarla la wea que tanto lloran ctm </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> ok.... a ver si entienden muchas vacunas creadas por varios paises tienen efecto segundario es por que las vacunas estan hechas por el mismo virus y tienes efectos como tos dolor de cabeza etc porque eso hace que tu cuerpo se vaya imunizando 
2 se que el virus comenzo en china por eso es que estan enojados con ellos pero china no se a lucrado con esto ningun pais asi que prefieren morir de covid y afectar a otros mas o vacunarse y a ver que pasa
3 estan haciendo prueban en chile porque en china hay muy pocos casos
4 YA DEJEN DE QUEJARSE DIOSSSSS LO DE LOS MICRO CHIP ES FALSOO SI ELLOS QUISIERAN DOMINAR EL MUNDO lo hubieran hecho en la vacuna de gripe aviar a mi me inyectaron como 10 vacunas y sigo con vida </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Con los Chinos? Mmmmmmm sospechosa la wea... </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 10> If true Gilead Sciences would be furious.  
Cost of Remdesivr in India would be 55000(750 dollars) rupees for 14 day treatment and Favipiravir  would be 2800 rupees. Plus remdesivir is not even that effective. Plus Favipiravir will work at early stages which would prevent people from needing critical care. Way to go Japan ,Russia. </COMMENT 10>

<COMMENT 17> Hi,
Some months ago I had s*x with the third guy in my life whom i was about to marry and now I have herpes. I couldn‚Äôt believe it because he wasn‚Äôt a random guy, he‚Äôs the closet guy I‚Äôve had as a boyfriend, but it has been a never ending nightmare since. I‚Äôve always believed in GOD and have asked him for forgiveness which is ironic.
I felt like killing myself with the taught of having a husband and family will be quite difficult and i felt like I‚Äôm not really in the room when people are talking. I didn‚Äôt know what to do and pretty much cry and pray every day to God for help and looking at my family with so much love and feeling that i have disappointed them even though they don‚Äôt know. Until God lead me to DR. IZAZA online who promised to help me cure my disease through herbals. At first i didn't believe him, but to my greatest surprise i was cured completely by herbals, which medical doctor also verified that i was cured. Special thanks to DR. IZAZA.
Don't be discourage because he that did it for me will also do it for you and you can contact him through his email address (DRIZAZAHERBALCUREHOME@GMAIL.COM) or text him on WHATSAPP phone number +2348103355314 </COMMENT 17>

<COMMENT 1> We need a vaccine for a virus to end it fast. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> So scary ü•∫ </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> How about we stop relying on vaccines and start relying on keeping our immune system healthy and strong üíØ </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Professionals: contagioncy is at an all time high.  Trump: open the schools </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> To those who wanted a world without vaccines: 


Here's a world without ONE vaccine </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> This video is full of fearmongering instead actual information </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> I was the 10th thousand person that liked. I fell special. Can I get a surprise </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Strengthen you immune that's the best defence
Dont rely on vaccines </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Ok if the vaccine never was discovered then we all be stuck at home or either we will all be wipeout </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> *_WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS..._* if it is still unclear as to whether having and recovering from CoViD-19 actually provides any long-term immunity, what chance does a vaccine (which is essentially like a 'watered-down version of it) have of immunizing one against it??? </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> People will eventually stop caring about the virus. Humans have a habit to adapt to the best and worst of environments. Infact I can go as far as to say people might even stop social distancing with the passage of time. Besides herd immunity seems promising too </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> I dont know whether to be afraid of covid or notüòÇ there is so much confusion and misinformation. And every state is handling it differently </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> The super wealthy is vaccine all ready dont u see them not wearing a mask and how ok they are? </COMMENT 13>

<COMMENT 15> Today's generation is gonna grow up with callused ears </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Hope left the chat </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Well that is depressing </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> The "cure" for the virus as well as its prevention is clear: Vitamin D3.  I am 79 and have been taking 10,000 IUs for six years and have not had the flu or a cold. Most people are Vitamin D deficient. Most deaths occur in convalescent homes or in dark skin persons. Neither get sunshine or vitamin D from the sun. Only a little is obtained from eating oily fish. The proof would be to autopsy those who actually died of the virus. You tube will produce hundreds of doctors who show you how and why this is the case.,  Vitamin D sold 2 billion dollars worldwide last year. Vaccines sold more than 387 billion dollars and that may be why you have not heard this before. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Honestly this whole video is such a bummer. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Humans will become immune to it in a certain time period. Just like Black Death </COMMENT 20>

No entendemos. Aunque vemos c√≥mo se mueve la pandemia en otros lugares, seguimos dando palos de ciegos.

<COMMENT 2> if he wasn't wearing an N95 mask, it still could have gotten through to him. Cloth masks don't 100% screen out the virus.  And he sounds pretty good for someone who was just upgraded from critical the night before. Sounds fishy to me..... </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> The sad thing is that there's a large percentage of the general population who just don't care whether they bring it home to their parent and grandparents, much less the fact that alot of you guys are sick and dying because you're all just trying to help them. It seems common sense has skipped a generation at least. It's ironic that it's not killing the morons spreading it willy nilly but  mostly killing the people who put them all in this world.

<COMMENT 3> I bought 100 5 layer KN95 face masks @  $2.95 each from UbiquityMedica.com  They work better than other masks I purchased.  They are cool/comfortable and I can get a good.  They told me to put them in a bag for 3 days after use and all the virus would be dead. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> I did buy face mask used twice, then it gave me itching nose I discarded the mask I haven't brought any since then </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> "Could help"... That's not science. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Watch Dr. Rashid Buttar before making a judgement. Not only masks are useless, they are bad for us! Don‚Äôt be naive. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> The autopsy of Covid patients show the virus is 67.9 nanometers. Nothing will stop it. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Dear DW News:  I like your way U do the news.  THANKSaBUNCH!!!
KNOWLEDGE is POWER!¬†¬†
Maybe EZ2FOOL sheeple aren‚Äôt aware about the current theory that his 'MAGIC' ways 2 PROTECT himself from SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) are by taking ANTIVIRALS (i.e., zovirax, acyclovir, valacyclovir, famciclovir, resveratrol, remdesivir, etc.) &/or protection by other vaccines (i.e., MMR, BCG, etc.); so, that‚Äôs could be a viable reason WHY he isn‚Äôt AFRAID NOT to WEAR a MASK, or take any preventative measures NOT to take a chance to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), or any other virus & WHY he‚Äôs not concerned with spreading it to anyone else.¬†¬†
KNOWLEDGE is POWER!
Also, ppl probably aren‚Äôt aware that ppl who have been infected w/ this specific virus will SUFFER for the remainder of their lives w/ miscellaneous symptoms - SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) will be this generation‚Äôs POLIO virus - like polio was for my generation.¬†¬†
KNOWLEDGE is POWER!
Employees from apprentice tv reality show have divulged he has had an STD (they have mentioned HERPES) for a long time; so, I‚Äôm wondering WHAT ANTIVIRALS he takes as a PROPHYLACTIC 2 prevent HERPES outbreaks on himself, & is it possible those ANTIVIRALS are working as a successful PROPHYLACTIC against SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) for him.¬† Maybe that‚Äôs one explanation for WHY he doesn‚Äôt wear a mask bc he‚Äôs PROTECTED against becoming INFECTED by SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), along w/ other viruses.¬† WHAT do U think about that? </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> How do u personally feel about the wearing of the nose mask?? </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> I would just wear a gask mask as it filters out 100% of droplets if I had one the best mask u can get </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> If a simple medical mask can prevent a person spreading the virus or their own germs then the obvious thing to do would be to make medical masks or any sort of face covering mandatory for everyone on the planet. Then no one can spread the virus to anyone else. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> At 72 years old, I enjoy every minute alive and can't understand why anyone would risk losing it or risking others life by not wearing a mask. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> I refuse to wear a Covid mask  because I don't serve the media god who scares people into wearing masks.  Acts 5:29. King James Version. "...We ought to obey God rather than men." </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Masks don‚Äôt work. Just keep your distance.  Be safe </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> It is common for someone to believe facts, there is no facts to the matter on The Masks situation there is a lot of opinions and mine is there for another reason other than other than Medical it's like social distancing is to keep you from getting splattered by someone sneezing when everyone sneezes different and the wind might be blowing that direction and it don't make sense but the fact of the matter is they are military instructions for tracking soldiers how to get out of the line of fire that's a fact </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> I sure that hope the time Never Comes when everybody sitting there find out the real reason for the masks what are they going to say and it was right there in front of my face the whole time I should have realized it you know they're laughing at us don't you? </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Alright I give up you people are talking like they taught you to talk </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> I know I've said too many opinions about this already but I'll be damned if I feel comfortable when I see people with masks on their scary and reminds me of sick people </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> masks don't necessarily prevent but they make sense that's why we wear them there's two reasons that they could be used for </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> they're only doing this so that they can come knocking at your door and take your son your daughter your wife are your kids away from you and put him in isolation can't you see that separation divide and conquer </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 13> 1:04 nooooo our pie community </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Problem I see is that youre assuming they testing same amount of people every day. If you test less, you would probably get lower cases, but doesnt mean the curve is actually reaching its peak </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> It is June 1, 2020.  We have now gone over 100,00 cases.  His calculations on right on the mark. AMAZING! </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Excellent information , I was confused until I saw this ...Thank You </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> if R=2 as early stated, statistically speaking shouldn't we all be infected by now? </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Bullshitter alerts are welcome </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> This is similar to compound interest which is also exponential growth for banks mostly - thats why there is also exponential poor people which is why God banned compound interest. </COMMENT 19>

<DESCRIPTION> Top infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci and the CDC are warning that the coronavirus pandemic is not over and recommend that Americans continue to ... </DESCRIPTION>
<TAGS> ['latest News', 'Happening Now', 'CNN'] </TAGS>
<COMMENT 1> The protesters raised the cases the most </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> CNN spreads the virus of ignorance. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Is okay to say we can‚Äôt stay locked in forever but as soon as some one gets hurts the front line workers are most at risk </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> America is rushing to opening and these are the consequences but unless you loose  a love one or yourself you wouldn‚Äôt care about covid 19 </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> It seems to me that Trump Inc NLC (NO Liability Corporation), are the deep state. Trump is clearly more concerned about his political future than the health of his own voters! </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Red states are BAD!!! how dare they open again for the business?
that is why  they told us 3 months ago that the second wave is coming, it is their plan to keep us locked down for business until we all get Bill's special 666 quantum dot tattoo vaccines so that we can buy and sell and travel and stop social distancing and stop wearing submission masks and other MINOR STUFF like LIVE our lives again.
So many hacks are "debunking" right now on social media something that is based on EVIDENCE... for example documentary PLANDEMIC provides that evidence from a resercher who worked in Fauci's den of vipers. If this documentary was really "debunkable" there would be NO NEED for Youtube, Facebook and other social media outlets to BAN the video, would it???????? 
This documentary have exposed the WHO, CDC, Gates, Fauci, CPP, UN and all other Big Pharma criminals and what is hiding behind the coronavirus.
Term *conspiracy theory* was invented by CIA to discredit those people that 
researched what really happened with murder of JFK. 
Affix the label "conspiracy theorist" to someone for daring to ask the questions, say about coronavirus, 
and majority would believe that anyone questioning it is a loony, they would then attack that person, because, why would our government lie to us?
We all know that they NEVER LIE?!
BTW, you cannot "debunk" something that is easily proven to be *true*. 
This exactly WHY so many paid hacks are right now trying to *debunk* this *Plandemic* documentary because it exposes the truth.
here is the link to this documentary that YouTube has removed* : https://www.bitchute.com/video/IB3ijQuLkkUr/ If they really wanted to "debunk it" they would leave it online.
watch it and then make up your own decision, it may save your life.
*Our world is ran by the cabal that conspires against us, it has been like that for a long time. *
Take a look at how someone who has a functioning mind can cut through the B.S. and lies that so many ordinary people, unfortunately, are buying hook, line and sinker. 
https://www.bitchute.com/video/Z8SOhTbhHot9/ </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> It's like a mom saying I told ya so and you didn't listen! Mmm hmmüòí </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> If you watch the full interview with Fauci he says that the only numbers that mean anything are the percentage of folks testing positive (which is between 5 and 10 percent in most counties)  and hospitalizations which have not spiked, neither of these numbers have spiked plus the key indicator of deaths in nursing homes has not shown anything.   Please note tha CNN is not going to give these too you since the number of tests are increasing at a rate faster than the infection is spreading but they sooo want to shut the country down so that people cant work to foul Trump.   All you urging others to listen to doctors and scientists need to follow your own advice and quit listening to the lying ass media!  I'm a democrat but don't respect anyone who lies period! </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Where was he during the protests? People aren‚Äôt Dying at the rats y‚Äôall said they would. Not shutting down again! </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Oh my...... why can‚Äôt people just listen. Go ahead and shut it down now.... </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> This channel is so corrupt </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Its a good year to live in Colorado. I am proud of everybody in colorado for doing a great job at flattening the curve. At this rate the amount of people with covid 19 and some other states like colorado will be qlmost 0 by the time holidays arrive. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Can you possibly imagine how ignorant our so-called medical experts are about the virus?  Imagine people with all this education, praise and experience can do nothing more than GUESS at what is going to help.  They should be ashamed of themselves and their profession.  The news media should be right behind them - as total idiots!! </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> In April the virus task force was ask by the news people should we be wearing mask and the response was no.  Now they are saying masks need to be worn along with social distancing and hand cleaning. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Police tried to stop a large gathering of churchgoers defiantly ignoring the Democrat governor's rules. After some confusion, the police found the group was simply there to burn the church down, pull down some monuments, and spray graphiti on adjacent businesses. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Moronic CNN trying to bash people for not wearing masks while they act like public commercial for looters and rioters doing same. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> They're not protests, they're riots. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> The CRAZYCATS üíâüò∑ are at it again!! FAKE VIRUS. Also starting racial tension before an election. Doesn't everybody remember this during the obama administration? Grade a LOSER'S!!üëπüëπüëπ LIES LIES LIES THAT'S ALL THEY KNOW!! CORRUPTION AND DECEPTION IS THEIR WAY!!üëπ </COMMENT 18>

<COMMENT 1> Todo en manos  de  Dios  y  nuestros  m√©dicos  saldremos  de esta  nunca  emos  estado  solos  fuerza  espiritual yla Uni√≥n  humanitaria  es reconocida  por  Dios  nos fortalece  amen </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Siempre hay que ver la ruta del dinero y del poder... Si las farmac√©uticas que investigan la vacuna estuvieran por el bien com√∫n no sacar√≠an patentes, sino que pondr√≠an al servicio de la humanidad gratuitamente sus investigaciones, para que en cualquier pa√≠s se pueda fabricar. Pero como todo este p√°nico e histeria colectiva ha sido creada con fines econ√≥micos y otros m√°s oscuros, entonces no van a regalar la f√≥rmula. Es decir, "yo te asusto, te digo que te vas a morir, pero yo te vendo la soluci√≥n, porque si te digo que el virus no es tan letal y que ya hay remedios m√°s baratos entonces no me compras" </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> O creo en las vacunas siempre tienen efectos secundarios y en muchos casos con el tiempo se prueba que fueron premeditados o muy poco seguros </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Y nada menos que los chinos los culpables del virus , y han elegido a Chile como conejillos de indias, porque no lo experimentan ellos los mal nacidos, aunque hagan trato con el Satan√°s gobierno chilenos  vacune se todos los Luciferianos del gobierno de Pi√±era y no vengan a experimentar con los m√°s indefensos y necesitados , ya que los que tienen el dinero fueron los desgraciados que llevaron el virus a Chile , de Dios tendr√°n el castigo ning√∫no se salvar√° de esos perversos , </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> NO  LE  VAYAN  A  CREER  .SEMEJSNTE  BARBARIDAD . VENDIENDO LA  POMADA. </COMMENT 5>

<COMMENT 8> Aqu√≠en le creeremos dicen que s√≠ y luego que no mmmm </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Que buena intervenci√≥n la del presentador 
Por que la paja de la vacuna solo es para ganar tiempo mientras matan a mucha m√°s gente </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Sabe qu√© es lo que deber√≠an decirnos??. QU√â ES LO QUE CONTIENE LA VACUNA??. Porque si tiene Fenxietanol, neurotoxina(aluminio), formaildehido(carcin√≥geno, agente de embalsamamietno), cantidades de suero bovino(sangre de vaca abortada), alb+umina humana(sangre humana), glutamato monos√≥dico(que causa dependencia, obesidad y deabetes), cantidades de MRC-5 (bebes humanos abortados), polimixina b (carcin√≥genos), cloruro pot√°sico(usado en inyecciones letales), fosfato pot√°sico(agentes de fertilizantes l√≠quidos), bicarbonato de sodio, borato s√≥dico(usado para el control de cucarachas), cloruro de sodio (sal de mesa), sitrato de sodio, fosfato s√≥dico, sorbitol, estreptomocina, saccarosa,, prote√≠na de levadura, urea(residuos metab√≥licos de la orina humana). No deber√≠as aplicartela he investiga sobre todo esto y sabras que todo esto es da√±ino y mortal y crea cambios en tu cuerpo, sin t√∫ saberlo. Recuerda que los doctores han hecho un juramento HIPOCR√ÅTICO y que deben cumplir, legalmente y respetuosamente niegate si no te la quieres poneryno hay nadie que te pueda obligar a ponertela. Consulta amablemente con el doctor que te atienda, si contiene MRC-5(c√©lulas de abortos), autom√°ticamente tendr√°s el derecho legal a negarte. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> haciendo la barba porque moderna ya va mas adelante </COMMENT 11>

<COMMENT 13> Cerca pero no la queremos.mas da√±o nos quieren causar con la vacuna </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Existen laboratorios mas avanzados con respecto a la vacuna. Yo pens√© que se iba a generalizar el tema, el titulo debe cambiarse a Jhonson and Jhonson y su probable vacuna... </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Mi pregunta es cuando salio el sars covi 1 no recuerdo en que a√±o sali√≥ y lo controlaron ahora sale el sars covi 2 es igual y.  No lo pueden controlar en verdad no entiendo nada el mumdo siempre a vivido con virus y ahora tenemos mucha technologia y estamos peor y nose que pasa con humamo pura mentiraa dios los perdone </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Digo yo por donde seva el virus y por donde vuelve  esta gente sabe lo que va a pasar brote y rebrote  todo corronpido  nuevo orden mundial una moneda una religion  etc,,, lo que unico que salva es el evangelio  de jesucristo  el alma es inmortal  asi que prepararse  para la eternidad  cielo  o  infierno.  Despues de la muerte el juicio   mientras ay vida  ay  esperanza  arrepentios y convertios </COMMENT 16>

<COMMENT 20> La visi√≥n futurista del covid 19 puede contemplarse desde principios de la f√≠sica,  en este caso , el de la inercia , todo cuerpo tiende a permanecer en el estado de reposo o de movimiento , en que se encuentra. Al comienzo de la pandemia, el entrar en la cuarentena requiri√≥ de un tiempo para aceptarlo comunitaria mente y requiri√≥ de aplicaciones adicionales desde el punto de vista econ'omico , log√≠stico, legal, emocional etc , para lograr "frenar" de alguna manera el accionar cotidiano de la sociedad. El restablecimiento de ese accionar va a requerir de adiciones de recursos econ√≥micos , emocionales , etc para lograr nuevamente esa normalidad a la que se aspira. Porque toda " acci√≥n origina una reacci√≥n " y todo ello se debe proyectar en base a consideraciones de este tipo para lograr " un equilibrio estable" . </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 1> Omg those idiots in Vegas with no masks!!! </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Falci's worst nightmare should be when he told Americans masks weren't necessary! </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> God please help white liberals. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Humanity must choose between evolving into a Star Treck money less society with high automation or we can devolve into mad max (if its not already like that now). Those are the 2 choices.  The competitive-hyper individualism of the  monetary system brings out the WORST IN US. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Our worst nightmare is Fauci. Fear monger extraordinaire. We haven't yet been properly indoctrinated into the new abnormal.  We need to be good little sheep/cattle first </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Andrew Cuomo is showing leadership by sending infected CORONAVIRUS patients back to NURSING homes killing thousands of elderly people in New York  . THATS RETARDED LEADERSHIP  ! </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> GEORGE FLOYD did not deserve to be murdered  . But he also wasnt a innocent child . He was wronged . </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> NZ & here in Australia we have listened to the medical experts. We hear from the regularly. We both also shut down really early ( in our case just in time). I also think the horriffic fires here over our summer, kept a lot of tourists from overseas away. Which probably helped keep the virus away in a critical time over December2019 </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> So good to see these lovely ladies without so much of the false flashes and paint üëçüëçüòÄ </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> There is already a spike!   are you not listening? She just named 5 to 6 states that have spikes! Of course if you're not directly impacted it seems unreal. The doctor already warned us about this before they started reopening businesses. The virus didn't  go away because people stopped talking about it! Trump says if we stop testing there'd be no more coronavirus!  Of course, he has magical thinking like a child! No talk about covid19 means he'll look better in the poles. But now comes the accusations of withholding vital health information from the public! Which, by the way, is against the law. The CDC, the WHO, National Health and Human Resources must be allowed to speak. If not from the Whitehouse  then from the news room. The nation cannot be left in limbo about the state of our health, just because we have a 10 year old for president. All his wish fulfillment doesn't work in adult society. No other free country would try to keep dangerous health information secret. Our nation has never done that until Donald Trump and the Republicans party got together on an all out efforts to destroy itself and our country. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> This guy has been wrong every time he turns around.Joy move to new zealan get out of hear </COMMENT 11>

In whatever language you look at it, the reality is otherwise. </COMMENT 5>

<COMMENT 10> the plants behind him weren't impressed. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> #SODAMNFAKE </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Mr Heng, you are reading from a script prepared for you by someone else. Yet, you can't even read it confidently and fluently. Your hand gestures are so artificially executed. They gave you away.

In addition, most of the things you have said are motherhood statements that can be spoken in any occasion. The big terms you used simply rings hollow, meaningless.

The measures you have taken are easy ways out - by using taxpayers' money in the National Reserves and then taken back later.

On the topic of creating jobs for Singaporeans, why never think of this before COVID-19? CECA is the biggest obstacle to all of us, and whatever jobs created are going to be stolen by foreigners, especially those from India.

"No one will be left to walk alone"? By importing more and more foreigners and convert them into Singapore Citizens in order to walk with us and steal, rob, seize our lunches and dinners? Or, in order to help the Covid-19 virus to spread easily and speedily in the next wave?

Basically, you guys have lost our trust already. Remember the stupid advice: "Do not wear a mask if you are not sick"? </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Oh BUT YOU WILL BE ALONE with God on your judgment. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Oh God..... </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Vote them out and boycott China </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> I am still confused on what help is available, only received $600 and really need more help. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> mean everyone will be tracked
no one will left alone </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> SG united. Yes no one should be left to walk alone. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> I think in the whole wide world only Singapore uses the term circuit breaker for social distancing. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Umm never walk alone, sorry i don't trust your talk there, cannot be taken in by such sweet wayang talk there... </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 1> das ist mal typisch f√ºr einen jesuiten und zdf finanzierte sprechpuppe , was ist daran wissenschaft , ein script zu spielen </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Ich breche es mal runter , ganz kurz und knapp f√ºr euch was ich so im Laufe der Jahre erfahren und gesp√ºrt habe. Es f√ºhlt sich f√ºr mich sehr real an und bin mir sicher es stimmt zu 80-90 % : Herr Lesch ist sehr warscheinlich ebenfalls ein negativ gestimmtes Wesen. Man kennt sie auch unter dem Namen Reptiloide, Drakos oder Drakonier. Diese sind Gestaltwandler. Allerdings glaube ich dass sie dass nicht selbst k√∂nnen sondern andere Alien Technologie benutzen. ( Ich bin mir nicht sicher, ob Drakos die selbe Spezies sind aber sie √§hneln sich) Sie versklaven die Menschheit schon tausende Jahre in dem sie unser Bewusstsein niedrig halten durch so Schmarrn wie Politik, Religion, Sprache 5G, social media bla bla bla die Liste ist endlos.... Im Grunde genommen sind wir G√∂tter und inkarnieren (bei Bedarf, ich glaube es ist freiwillig ob man wieder auf Erden inkarnieren m√∂chte) immer wieder neu hier. Unsere Seele stirbt nicht, und kommt sogar von anderen Planeten im Universum. Das hei√üt wir sind auch Au√üerirdische... wow wer h√§tte es gedacht. Wie gesagt, bezogen auf unsere Seele. Au√üer Reptiloide gibt es noch andere negative Au√üerirdische die uns "versklaven". Beispielsweise Greys, kleine graue M√§nnchen wie man sie aus Filmen kennt, gro√üe schwarze Augen etc etc. Ebenso Tentakelmonster oder eine Art b√∂ses Leben in einer K.I. (K√ºnstliche Intelligenz), wie man es bei Skynet kennt. Damit nicht genug, es gibt wohl auch negative Wesen die nicht physisch sind die uns schaden. Beispielsweise Archonten, Archonten sind Geistwesen (D√§monen), sind¬†gewissenlose Seelen¬†die sich in einer Art Zwischendimension auf der Erde befinden.Wichtig ! Ich bin mir sicher, dass nicht direkt jedes Tentakelmonster oder jeder Reptiloid b√∂se ist. Aber die Meisten sch√§tze ich.Der Mensch wird, so nur als Nahrung, Sklave gehalten. Urspr√ºnglich wurde der Mensch glaube ich von den Annunaki erschaffen. Sie waren auf der Suche nach Rohstoffen wie Gold um die Atmosph√§re ihres Planeten Nibiru mit einer Art Maschine in Verbindung mit Gold zu s√§ubern, retten. Gold ist eine ziemlich krasse und kraftvolle "Materie". Fun Fact: √úber den Pyramiden in √Ñgypten waren anfangs auch massive Goldspitzen oben drauf. Ach und im Sudan gibt es gef√ºhlt 200 mal mehr Pyramiden als in √Ñgypten :D  Die Annunaki haben dann die Erde und Afrika entdeckt, den Goldvorkommen  und kreuzten dann irgendwann DNA mit den Menschen die auf Erden in B√§umen lebten. Demnach war diese "erste Kreuzung" die Geburt von Adam und Eva und das alte Testament ist also fast durchweg ein Zeugnis der Annunaki und somit leicht zu" f√§lschen umschreiben".  Kommen wir zur√ºck zu den Pedophilen, Sie agieren im Hintergrund aber jeder hat sie schon mal gesehen. Ihre Zeichen, Logos und tausend Begriffe die man damit verbindet wie zb. Illuminaten, Freimaurer, MK Ultra, die Pyramide, die Eule, das zugedeckte Auge, Die Handzeichen Satansh√∂rner und dreimal Sechs. Fast alle Hollywoodstars, Politiker oder Sportler die Rang und Namen haben sind mit in diesem Netzwerk verwickelt. Ein riesiges weltweit gro√ües P√§dohilennetzwerk auch genannt, Pizzagate. Sie verschleppen kleine Kinder, vergewaltigen, foltern, t√∂ten sie in okkulten Ritualen (dunkle Magie). Und ja Magie existiert. In jedem von uns und um jeden von uns. Es f√§llt einem leichter damit zu arbeiten wenn es einem Bewusst wird. Unter diese Magie f√§llt auch Astralreisen, Teleportation, Gedankenlesen, Vorhersehung, Manifestation etc etc. Kannst du es dir vor deinem inneren Auge vorstellen, bist nur DU die einzige H√ºrde warum es nicht wahr werden sollte :) Sie streben eine NWO (New World Order) an, indem nur noch 1/3 der Menschheit lebt , die alle gechipped sind und perfekt kontrolliert werden k√∂nnen. Sie foltern und √§ngstigen die Kinder so, damit deren Blut voller Angst (Adrenochrom ) getr√§nkt ist, um es dann zu trinken. Damit verl√§ngern sie ihr Leben, brauchen es warscheinlich um weiterleben zu k√∂nnen. Ebenso hat dieses Blut wohl berauschende Wirkung. Sie handeln im Auftrag von Satan. Ein gro√ües Ziel ist es denke ich, trotz dieser Horror-Kom√∂die was sich unser Leben nennt nicht das Positive aus den Augen zu verlieren. Sein eigenes inneres Paradies schaffen, egal wie die Umst√§nde von Au√üen sind. Durch die Verdummung und Verbl√∂dung der Menschen durch TV, Radio, Schulen, Zeitungen etc f√§llt es ihnen schwer in ihre Kraft zu kommen und sind so sehr anf√§llig f√ºr D√§monen in Form von schlechten Angewohnheiten, Lastern, S√ºchten oder negativen Gedanken. S√§mtliche Hollywoodstars sind von D√§monen besessen und haben ihre Seele an den Teufel verkauft um ber√ºhmt zu werden. Wer da nicht mitspielen will, der wird halt nicht ber√ºhmt...Hier auch : Nat√ºrliche nicht Alle Stars... aber fast Alle... auch hier in Deutschland.... :D Die Musikindustrie ist da ziemlich krass. Aleister Crowley hat damals schon herausgefunden dass, das Gehirn, welches in Fl√ºssigkeit liegt, also prima beeinflusst werden kann durch Musik, also Schwingung. Kombiniert man das mit dunkler Magie, baut kranke satanische Loblieder f√ºr satan himself ein, in vielen Songs  wie zb den Beatles, Abba , Queen oder den heutigen Rappern etc etc. Da ein Christ nicht verflucht werden kann, haben sie es geschaffen, wenn man sich  diese Lieder da anh√∂rt und so fr√∂hlich mitsingt, dass man sich insgeheim selbst verflucht und man sich selbst sogar noch schadet. Die steuernden Einfl√ºsse der Annunaki auf unsere Menschheit finden nicht √∂ffentlich, sondern vorwiegend durch Geheimgesellschaften statt. Ja ich wei√ü es ist gruselig. Umso wichtiger ist es dann halt jetzt mal aufzuwachen ;) PS : Das ist nur die Spitze des Eisberges..... Man k√∂nnte sich stundenlang dar√ºber unterhalten was da so schief l√§uft bei uns auf Erden. Aber wie gesagt, verliert nicht die Hoffnung :) Putin und Trump setzen sich f√ºr die Menschheit und k√§mpfen f√ºr uns. ENDGAME :) GUT gegen B√ñSE, SATAN gegen GOTT. Wird die Menschheit versklavt , jeder wird gezwangsimpft und gechipped ? Oder ist der amerikanische Einfluss Trumps auf Deutschland doch st√§rker und er bewahrt uns davor. Es bleibt spannend :) </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Der einzige der hier Verschw√∂rungstheorien verbreitet ist der gute Harald selber mit seinem geistigen D√ºnnschiss! Unfassbar was ein gigantischer Dummschw√§tzer </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Dem prof.Lesch zu glauben hiesse es an Mondlandung zu glauben. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Ich glaube, denen geht ganz sch√∂n die Muffe, wenn man rausbekommen w√ºrde, dass der Lockdown umgehbar gewesen w√§re. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Ich hatte Ihre Videos stehts gemocht. Betong liegt auf "hatte". Das Sie sich f√ºr L√ºgen hergeben h√§tte ich nicht gedacht. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Am√ºsant wie bereitwillig Verschw√∂rungsheinis es immer wieder selbst best√§tigen , da√ü sie Idioten sind . </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Und Heute, also drei Monate sp√§ter, sollte auch ein Herr Lesch bemerkt haben, dass er manchmal einfach nur von Dingen redet, von denen er √ºberhaupt keine Ahnung hat. 
Was f√ºr eine √ºberfl√ºssige Panikmache. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Ich habe die Sorge von Herrn Lesch, dass die Krankenh√§user √ºberlastet werden k√∂nnten, zu Beginn geteilt. Auch habe ich 1 Monat darauf gewartet, bevor ich mir eine Meinung dazu bildete, wie gerechtfertigt diese Ma√ünahmen sind. Mittlerweile ist klar ersichtlich, dass die Krankenh√§user keineswegs √ºberlastet sind und die Ma√ünahmen aus diesem Betrachtungswinkel keineswegs gerechtfertigt sind. Es √§rgert mich, dass Herr Lesch keine Stellung dazu bezieht Monate nach diesem Video. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Widerlich anzusehen, windet sich wie eine Schlange obwohl es so offensichtlich ist, dass die Zahlen aus der Luft gegriffen sind... </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> lso. 3 monate sp√§ter...: Keine dieser Prognosen ist eingetreten. Doch alles Hype. Die Entschuligung jetzt: Das konnte man nicht wissen. Aha! Man hat also doch auf Verdacht gehandelt, Und all die Jahre davor hat man auch nicht reagiert. Wu√üte man es da, was kommt? </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> 3:11: Die Schlu√üfolgerung ist schon mal falsch! es sind in Bergamo 20 statt 10personen t√§glich gestorben, OK. Aber wieso sollen die zus√§tzlichen 10 an Corona gestorben sein? Gibt es die (wissenschaftlichen) Beweise? </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Lesch hat sich hier mal wieder selbst zum Narren gemacht. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Die Idee war nur Spass, letztes Jahr eine Erkrankung erfinden um die schwarzen Afrikanern los zu werden. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> H√§tten Sie besser mal das andere Video gemacht, dann h√§tte es auch einen like gegeben. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> H√∂rt ihr das auch? Wenn man ganz leise ist, vernimmt man ein ganz leises Rascheln...





...die Aluh√ºtchen kommen. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Sie reden √ºber idiotische Verschw√∂rungstheorien. Gehen sie bitte mal auf wesentliche Sachen ein , wie √ºber den Ursprung des Virus. Es ist kein nat√ºrlicher Virus und stammt aus dem Labor! Menschen die an der Impfstoffentwicklung arbeiten werden umgebracht! In der Vergngenheit wurden auch neue Krankheiten entwickelt und in Afrika und Indien Menschen  geimpft, als diese Impfstoffe von neutraler Seite untersucht wurde, kam raus, es macht unfruchtbar, enth√§lt h√∂chst sch√§dliche Substanzen f√ºr Totgeburten usw. Sagte Gates ja selber das wir √ºberv√∂lkert sind, er ginanziert die WHO mit mehr Geld als die USA. Bitte trauen Sie sich das mal anzusprechen oder wissen Sie das nicht? </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Nach den BLM Demos gegen Rassismus wo zigtausende eng ohne Maske zusammenstanden gab es keine erh√∂hte Coronasterberate, das beweist, dass die Ma√ünahmen unn√∂tig und menschenverachtend sind.Der R wert war vor dem Lockdown unter 1 und ist es auch geblieben aber die Ma√ünahmen haben die Menschen entrechtet, bevormundet und in den psychischen sowie physichen Ruin getreiben. Therapien finden nicht statt, OPs nicht etc. In meinem Bekanntenkreis sind alte Menschen gestorben im Pflegeheim, weil sie den Lebensmut durchs Alleinsein ohne Besuch verloren hatten, weil sie vertrocknet sind, da Angeh√∂rige nicht auf genn√ºgend Trinken achten konnten..Der finanzielle Ruin wird noch weitere tausende Opfer finden, die Selbstmordrate hat sich erh√∂ht, die Gewalt gegen Kinder, Kurzarbeit... Und das alles f√ºr einen Virus dessen Gef√§hrlichkeit √ºberhaupt nicht klar ist. In D sterben t√§glich 3000 Menschen, jetzt sind innerhalb von 4 Monaten 9000 mit oder an? Corona gestorben, Alter81, und es gibt Ma√ünahmen, die zig tausend Opfer fordern und uns alle traumatisieren. Psychoterror in √ñffis durch Dauerwarnung, Angst vor Mitmenschen, Abstand-soziale K√§lte,  Einsamkeit etc.
Die Menschen sterben an der Behandlung durch Sedierung und Beatmung und durch die Ma√ünahmen. Unsere Regierung ist leider inkompetent, menschenverachtend, lobbyistisch, empathielos und machtgeil. 
Unsere Qualit√§tsmedien tun alles um die Menschen weiter in Angst zu halten, damit sie gef√ºgig bleiben, und wer hat schon gerne Angst? Auch das ist ein sehr hinterh√§ltiges, empathieloses, unausgewogenes Verhalten. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> So, 3 Monate sp√§ter ,in Deutschland Sterberate niedriger als im Vorjahr!!!
Herr Lesch , reden sie lieber von Dunkler Materie, ist auch blo√ü unbewiesene Theorie! Aber bitte nie mehr √ºber Viren!
Lassen sie Leute vom Fach, wie einen Virologen Herrn Bhakdi oder Herrn Streeck zu Wort kommen. Ich glaube ihrem Ges√ºlze schon lange nichts mehr! </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 18> Usted es un profesional de la ciencia. Me cuesta creer que usted crea las mentiras que se dan por los medios. Yo no soy un conspiranoico, no s√© la verdad; pero est√° claro que nos est√°n mintiendo y que esto no se basa en SANIDAD sino CONTROL SOCIAL. Saldremos de esta con un control total de los ciudadanos por parte de los gobiernos. 
Y todo esto ocurre en un momento en que la sociedad MUNDIAL la estaba liando parda, cada uno en su pa√≠s, hab√≠a manifestaciones en pa√≠ses en los que nunca las ha habido a lo largo del mundo, y ahora tienen una excusa perfecta para darnos palos. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Damian; tengo una duda, cuando es : [ ep ] (multiplican) y cuando [ e+p] (suman) dichos parametros? particularmente lo trate de ver lo trate de ver como el principio de multiplicacion y suma en el conteo; no se si aplique a la exposicion y  a la probabilidad de contagio. </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 13> Es un error comparar cifras globales por pa√≠ses, porque la cantidad de habitantes es distinta.
2.000.000 contagiados en Brasil corresponde al 1% de la poblaci√≥n, mientras que la misma cantidad de contagiados en Chile corresponde al 11,1% de la poblaci√≥n. Las comparaciones entre pa√≠ses deben ser corregidas por la poblaci√≥n. Se debiera informar contagiados/mill√≥n de habitantes. </COMMENT 13>

<COMMENT 4> 1. Leaked HIV records
2. Hepatitis outbreak that wasn't reported till months later, Singhealth data breach 
3. Selected presidency, position has now been undermined as just another puppet of the ruling party
4. Highest paid ministers in the world for mediocre performances
5. 158th in press freedom index
6. POFMA abuse
7. Drafting in of paper generals and ministers in positions without relevant qualifications
8. Hippocritical and arrogant ministers (HARA KIRI??) , ministers who shut down proper and IMPORTANT questions by opposition, the amount of double standards by the ruling party
9. Highest COVID19 cases in SEA, lost to a lesser developed country like Vietnam, no accountability from the ruling party citing "no benefit of hindsight"
10. Little to no help for self-employed individuals during COVID19

I could go on, but we are just ordinary singaporeans who want change since people like you are so out of touch with us common folk and high up in your ivory towers like your other millionaires in office. To us, Singapore is now nothing but a playground for the rich. To those cancel culture government lapdogs, cue your "not happy move out" mindset and understand that we do not have the luxury to move out due to finances and family commitments. </COMMENT 4>

<COMMENT 20> PM Lee says Singapore able to keep a low death rate ie 25 deaths.
Note
Mr PM, there were 10 died b4 tested positive not included on deaths tally. Why?
1) selective testings may have  resulted in such situation.
2) if Sweden were to copy Singapore's method, they have "zero" death. .
3) its comparing apples and oranges </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 3> Why don't they go put one of those signs in the CHAZ? </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> June 10 2020 report by Prof Michel Chosuddovsky revealed that there was a report from investigation into the Covid19 performed by a team of experts in Germany contracted by the German Government. Report "globalen Fehalarm". They found out that Covid19 is a "Global False Alarm".  U.S. Senator doctor Scott Jensen in an interview stated that he received a seven page document showing how to fill out "death certificates" for patients who didn't have Lab test verification for Covid19. Medicare will pay $13,000 thirteen thousand dollars for each person listed as Covid19. And another $39,000 thirty nine thousand dollars for each person on a ventilator.  Even Italy's MP Vittorio Sgarbi declares concerning Covid19. That the data is "fake data". </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> People are done staying home. Go ahead and try to tell us again and see how that works out for you </COMMENT 5>

I wake up every morning hoping to hear he died of a heart attack over night. I know it's wrong but I feel he's responsible for thousands and thousands of deaths that could have been avoided if he took things seriously or responsibly from day one. </COMMENT 11>

<COMMENT 1> wow ABC is trash. News for the dumb and easily manipulated. Another news story mean to stoke distrust and destroy public opinion of China... </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> This theory is a real stretch.  A lot of people had flu and didn't test positive for COVID-19 antibodies. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> A pandemic in a large city of the proportions that "flooded hospital car parks" would hardly have gone unnoticed by the foreign residents of that city. Then, there would have been the spike in internet chatter on the subject. The West will say it was censored but the West often cites the "censored" net chatter when it suits the Western agenda. Last but not least, there are the super efficient Western Intel agencies, remember ? Both those run by Western governments and private groups. Why didn't they pick anything up ? Sounds like just another spin of the conspiracy theory wheel. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Covid lives Matter.. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Best of luck. Brazil is 2nd in the world for reported Covid 19 deaths. I wonder what the true number of deaths in China. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Be prepared to be killed as these people were - https://youtu.be/UIDsKdeFOmQ - just found out how people have been killed in hospitals under Covid pretense </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> In northern Ontario Canada this winter I would say early December we had a wicked upper respiratory infection. People were sick for 3 weeks it was nuts. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> What about previous years? Maybe 2018 was a low year for hospital visits in that area or seasonal flu happened earlier or later. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> thing changing and evolving fast in china, a 100% jump YTY on parking may just because people owns more cars there. Keep in mind majority of people using public transportation there. if you can pin point the people move in and out, thats different story.  such a poor study, cannot believe it can went to news media... </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> This is not a surprise since mediocre CCP always uses Censorship, lies with its brutal totalitarian regime. Now, they will say that these satellite imagines and other evidences to hide the outbreak are rigged. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> The evidence points to the flu being bad last year, not coronavirus in October.  We would have seen many more countries with the virus if it had been circulating in China in October.  You should label this story "Doctor jumps to conclusions on flimsy evidence" </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Covid19 looks very scary because you can die and you can not just die you will spread the virus ü¶† </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> My dear American people, there are underground car parks for all the hospitals mentioned in this video. You counting car number through satellite photo is already hilarious enough </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> So China lied again? But liberals are still focused on Trump. It 's ok to focus on Trump. But at least be tough on China and liberals in the U.S. Bad look when you let them go and jump on Trump for holding a Bible in front of a burned down church. When America really need some positive images. Because the Democrat Mayor was not ready for a mob. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> A bad study... so influenced... Shame... </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> ABC. Still comparing Chinese & US. Numbers? You should be ashamed . </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> I hope all die </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> My whole house was nasty ill back in january. Had to have been covid. Cough deadly sickness. Someone is lying. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> So, the deeper they dig, the closer this *doesn't* get to the White House. <shock>
On a separate note: did we know that they're not teaching kids in the US about Tiananmen Square? China's the fun, "tiktok" people, right? </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> This is total gratuitous guess, due to the pathetic isolation and ignorance of China. Awake from the dream and face  that we have delayed and missed the best timing because of Trump! </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 12> En quoi un n√©phrologue est qualifi√© pour parler de maladies infectieuses? Je suis citoyen et je trouve consternant ces confr√®res qui sont attir√©s par les m√©dias comme les moustiques par la lumi√®re.
Savoir dire je ne sais pas je ne suis pas sp√©cialiste dans ce domaine est le minimum de modestie que les patients attentent de leur m√©decin. Orage inflammatoire cela ne veut rein dire - cela fait plus de 20 ans que nous ne savons pas soigner les oed√®mes l√©sionnelles par fibrose de l'√©changeur alv√©ole capillaire 
Quand on est m√©decin on s'efface derri√®re ces datas et derri√®re l'int√©r√™t des patients. Vous n'avez pas lu le livre du Pr Peronne mais vous avez un avis tout est dit. En appeler au tribunal m√©diatique est consternant. Taisez vous Monsieur taisez vous </COMMENT 12>

<COMMENT 14> Ou est ton contradicteur √† toi ?C ¬¥ est pas ton coll√®gue c‚Äô est un professeur et puis Peronne n‚Äô a pas dit que les m√©decins qui n‚Äô ont pas prescrit le protocole du professeur Raoult √©taient des criminels,mais ceux qui les ont emp√™cher de prescrire √©tait des criminels en l‚Äôoccurrence  ceux qui ont entraver la libert√© de prescription aux m√©decins, tout √ßa pour nous pondre un vaccin plus cher nous l‚Äô avons tous compris .

<COMMENT 17> Thank you for this video . Let‚Äôs truly try our best be kind to each other . Drop negative comments . 
Let‚Äôs work on our inner world to create love peace harmony so we can radiate this positive qualities and positive vibration everywhere we go. 
Because negative emotions , feelings are like Venom , dangerous for poisoning yourself and others . 
Let‚Äôs learn to pause 1 min and count to 10 or whatever works for each of us before we spill out any negativity . 
I love to listen instrumental of love peace harmony melody , it soothes you from inside , heals inner child and later developed wounds and helps to just be kind to yourself and others . If we are kind , patient , loving to ourselves, we are same to others .... let‚Äôs stop hurting ourselves , then violence to others with be stopped.

<COMMENT 18> <COVID-19 TRUTH>
*Most people won‚Äôt get the virus.*
*Most of the people who get it won‚Äôt display symptoms.*
*Most of the people who display symptoms will only be mildly sick.*
*Most of the people with severe symptoms will never be critically ill.*
*And most of the people who get critically ill will survive.*

This is borne out by the numerous serological studies which show, again and again, that the infection fatality ratio is on par with flu.
( https://swprs.org/studies-on-covid-19-lethality/ )
There is no science ‚Äì and increasingly little rational discussion ‚Äì to justify the lockdown measures and overall sense of global panic.
Nevertheless, it‚Äôs always good to get official acknowledgement of the truth, even if it has to be leaked.
Here are three leaks showing that those in power know that the coronavirus poses no threat, and in no way justifies the lockdown that is going to destroy the livelihoods of so many.
1. ‚ÄúIT‚ÄôS ALL BULLSHIT!‚Äù
On May 26th Dr Alexander Myasnikov, Russia‚Äôs head of coronavirus information, gave an interview to former-Presidential candidate Ksenia Sobchak in which he apparently let slip his true feelings.
( https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/05/27/its-all-bullsht-russias-coronavirus-information-chief-says-of-virus-fears-a70398 )
Believing the interview over, and the camera turned off, Myasnikov said:
It‚Äôs all bullshit [‚Ä¶] It‚Äôs all exaggerated. It‚Äôs an acute respiratory disease with minimal mortality [‚Ä¶] Why has the whole world been destroyed? That I don‚Äôt know,‚Äù

<TITLE> TSA Whistleblower: Agency Is Failing To Protect Officers, Travelers From COVID-19 | NBC Nightly News </TITLE>
<URL> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VutslpE1Q9o </URL>
<TIMESTAMP> 2020-06-21T23:43:19Z </TIMESTAMP>
<DESCRIPTION> A senior TSA official in Kansas says there is no nationwide standard for personnel to wear personal protective equipment. The agency reports 706 employees ... </DESCRIPTION>

<COMMENT 1> Agreed.  Finally some common sense.  The shields are 100% necessary or citizens will get the bat virus engineered by UNers with their foolish globalization.

Do these fool humans want to be surveilled by getting infected???  Do the idiots out there in crowds have a bat brain disease.  Looking like it‚Äôs the political agendas of both sides left and right directed at mandatory contact tracing and surveillance vaccines to become mandatory.  

Google and Apple have attached Covid19 contact tracers within their API with Bluetooth in their OS 13.5 upgrade.  Uploads are automatic no matter how you try to block.  You have lost your freedom of choice.

Those that upload the apps put the rest of us in jeopardy.  These actions are within the corrupt United Nations and WHO Agenda 2030 sustainable development goals.  All the fake green claims are untrue in fact.  

Please get better informed on viruses like Covid19 ...Face masks without goggles and the fools then hands all over their stupid masks.  People the virus spreads through all mucus membranes.  Where are the face shields??? In Canada the plastic for face shields cannot be found anywhere.  

This is enabled by our UN puppet politicians, presidents and prime ministers because 193 nations leaders are signed onto Agenda 2030.  This is the sad reality.  Stop listening to unscientific uninformed people and world leaders and doctors.  Watch the corrupt UN in bed with dictatorships not fake UN propagandism and news.  #UNWATCH </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Who knew dismantling the national pandemic prevention agency afters sars/swine-bird flu/ebola;  that without a national standard measures of quarantine; airports/planes were "safer". </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> How can you expect the problem of covid to go away when Nibiru keeps moving closer toward Earth? ...

DUH, YOU SAY?

CNN and C-Span did coverage on Nibiru, they have a backbone... Do the right thing MSNBC and release the Nibiru warning ...

For those who want to learn about Nibiru - view my videos before it is too late... </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> TSA has been completely incompetent since its' inception. They don't have the brains to take precautions without instructions. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> POLICE morale, law and order is seriously dropping as these Demoncrat states don't support the men in blue. See what is happening, shootings,
 death and crime everywhere! Seattle Mayor is a joke! This is a good example of what defunding the police will do. Why is most of the "UNREST", worst crimes & everything controversial occuring in the BLUE DEM States and Cities? You should vote the DEMs back in if you like how they treated you in the past 4 months. If you don't want Law & Order, and leaders that stand back and watch death & destruction, defund the police, and vote Dems. If you hate Family and like abortion killings, Vote Dems! If you want your taxes back up, Vote Dems! If you want jobs to go back to China, Vote Dems! If you like being treated like a child and told what to do? Vote Dems </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Republicans: "We're killing America and ourselves...so we can keep it great!" </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Gee, appears that dummy, Donald, is doubling down on his dumb-down!  Just when you thought it really couldn't get any dumber!  Then, there's his serious gambling problem.  Using the U.S. population as throw-away poker chips, Toxic Trump keeps doubling-down on his loss of American life to deadly COVID-19 pandemic gamble, while holding a losing hand--won't stop! </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> I thought we were supposed to keep the whistleblowers identities hidden? ü§îü§îüòÇ it was just last year that everyone was screaming that </COMMENT 8>

<COMMENT 11> This is a shame </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> TSA are a waste of money. Studies have shown they have a 90% fail rate. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> hey NBC why dont you report about the killing that happened in chaz? you know the one where the police werent allowed to enter so the person who got shot died...why dont you report about that?? </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Good because the TSA shouldnt exist </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Do you think everyone automatically knows what TSA stands for. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Well, main thing is that democrats protect the whistleblowers themselves from scrutiny! </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Is there some uptick in cases amongst TSA? No? Ya don't say </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Big whoop </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> TSA really needs to get their acts together to quickly develop a national plan to protect airport employees and also an effective to screen COVID-19 on every traveler going through to the security check. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> at least he said something. he will get fired and they will give him a lame reason why </COMMENT 20>
