<COMMENT 1> Superb </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Looks like fun </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> While the nasal swab wasn't totally unpleasant for me I would like to know if there are more accurate tests that DON'T involve jamming something up my nose.
10/10 for the test subject. This carps all over that Mount Sinai video. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Awesome step-by-step explanation. Thanks. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Thank you to the person getting the swab. Very informative seeing an actual person getting tested. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> My friend liked the black t-shirt of that guy who took the swab in this video. Any idea where i can find one like that? </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> how come the one taking the swab is not properly wearing  PPE especially wearing mask for protection? Gloves is not enough to protect you during swab </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> I’m scared if I have the Coronavirus, I’m showing symptoms..but this makes me feel better knowing it’s not as bad as I thought. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Thank you sooo much. There's so many awful and just plain wrong demos out here. For example i just can't believe how terrible the video on this released by Mount Sinai is. Scary </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> 5-6 cm is not deep enough to get to the  nasopharynx. And it's easier to make sure you're passing along the floor of the nose if head is tilted forward about 5 degrees, which lines  it up with the horizontal plane. Leaning head back makes it more likely you'll go up and over the inferior turbinate and hit the middle turbinate or face of the sphenoid sinus instead of getting to the nasopharynx. Both of these can be injured and would be very painful to hit with the swab. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Thanks for the demonstration. why swab on the wall of the pharynx only, what about the tonsil pillars </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Who came from a Reddit post? </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> It was my understanding that you needed to swab both sides. Can you please clarify </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Great job </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> great! </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> 👍👍👍 </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Oropharyngeal swab shouldn't be placed in the sample collection tube?? I don't understand
(Last sentence in the video) </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> This appears to be the best way to collect sample and exactly why I doubt the public at large will  be able to perform this on a home test.  The average Joe and Jolene will NOT insert that swab that deeply into their own nose and then the results will likely be inaccurate. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> I have no experience collecting these samples, but I know the anatomy, having done nasolacrimal duct surgery. This demonstration appears to correctly show the route to the nasopharynx. I can only guess that the layman, seeing the nose from the outside, thinks the only logical route into the nose goes parallel to the externally visible bridge of the nose. So far, the other demonstrations I have seen show the swab aiming upward toward the cribriform plate area. I suspect that the many presumed false negatives that ER and ICU doctors have seen are due to this sampling error, though a study comparing the prevalence of Covid-19 in these various locations within the nasal cavity might prove me right or wrong. The only fault I see in this video is the statement that two inches is the distance the swab is advanced to reach the nasopharynx, while it clearly looks much farther (from the entry to the nose) than that. I fear if a neophyte follows that guideline, he will be sampling only the inferior nasal turbinate. But good work otherwise. I welcome any correction to my impression. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> So you recommend swabbing only one nare? </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 1> We are all in a state of uncertainty about spreading Covid 19. Take an example of India now the spreading is skyrocketing, though the risks of importing cases are the paramount the number of Covid 19 tests, asymptomatic ratios are significantly higher in India when comparing with United States or GCC countries.  With 2.3 Billion population with poverty and limited medical resources to analyse the infected data it is highly possible India will soon overtake the world No.1 in Covid-19 cases.

So, the US Government knows this situation is going to get much worse (FEMA job offerings) because they are the one's in charge of the situation.

These FEMA death camps were build 15 years ago so, what does that tell you.

The COVID19 throat swabs tainted with the virus ?

Will the vaccination shots give people the virus like the "flu shot" gives the elderly the flu ?

Government officials in other states are telling their citizens that there are dangers insects in the area and aircraft will be conducting an Ariel Spraying CAMPAIGN over their neighborhoods at sunset when people are at home.

People in the food processing industry are mysteriously becoming sick with COVID19 therefore, food shortages can arise.

The US Government is buying up all face masks and gloves then hiding them is warehouses in order to keep them out of the hands of needy citizens.

Secrecy behind the global 5G surveillance program and the widespectuum RF Radiation that is dangerous to people's health.

People and their families living on special Military bases since last year are restricted from television, raido, internet and all outside comuniciations with the outside world and these military personal are flying these high ALTITUDE aircraft that are spraying a mystery fluid into the air whereas these elongated offwhite clouds are seen everywhere.  

People in the News Media are observed smiling and with grinds on their faces when discussing the deadly global Pandemic.

No one person in the upper most portion of the US Government has ever been seen wearing a mask. Have they received a vaccination shot prior to the Pandemic ? </COMMENT 16>

<COMMENT 9> Hello, sir.

Let me introduce myself, I'm Ferry, from Bogor, Indonesia.

Just sharing info. That in Indonesia, our small team, named Milagros, has given milagros water donations to hospitals that treat positive patients.

And the result, just by drinking Milagros water, recovery from covid19, is very perfect.

In our data, it has been noted that Milagros water is able to fight covid19. Also other health problems.

What I'm focusing on is that in Indonesia there is no need for a vaccine. We just take Milagros, corona can be overcome.

Right now, what your country does not have, but in my country is very abundant, is Milagros water.

Which is clearly proven to be able to cure positive patients covid19 to completion.

And it's proven, some of our small teams don't need an anti-covid vaccine. Just drinking milagros, it's resolved.

If you want to know more about Milagros water, you can contact my Whatsapp number at +6285925081694 </COMMENT 9>

<COMMENT 11> There was an interesting interview on CNBC with the former head of the FDA who was stating that no single vaccine will be the 'winner'. This was because no single company will be able to manufacture all the doses required, and more importantly, he believed no single vaccine would be the most effective across age groups. So we need all the vaccines we can get, ASAP. </COMMENT 11>

<COMMENT 2> Hi Mike, It would be good to mention the relationship between D3 and K2(MK7) the two go hand in hand. D3 on its own actually can do damage to the heart. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> If humidity is a factor and heat then why are there cases in Florida and Texas at this time of the year in June.  Hotter areas of the country are still experiencing Covid19, and it is now June 6, 2020. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> thank you doctor but with autoimmune diseases we need more(zinc,vitamines D3,k2,A,C...) </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Well I caught the virus and I gake vitaminc c and I was better within 4 days. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Dr. Mike, always informative with no fluff. Thanks for helping to educate people and help them navigate to junk science and noise on the web today. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Requirements of Vitamin c or D or both or multivitamins vary person to person. But actually weather doesn't do anything  with pandemic bcoz some countries are v hot some are v cold and still situation is same regarding COVID-19.. its actually virus who had mutation in a v short duration and causing deaths at the same pace..
Please make video about this. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> I hear so many recommendations about taking vitaminD supplements over the counter, however nobody explains what is in these softgels,  what’s the liquid inside these softgels, what do they put inside these softgels. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> You need to take zink and vitamin d , you may have a problem getting zink , God bless 🎈 </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> There are no numbers telling 4000 IU a day is a maximum. There are only, that 4000 IU is good enough for MOST people to get their blood numbers normal. It is not for those with stronger deficiencies etc. Very bad combination of information. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> I'm impressed by the suggestive recommendations being made to help me understand better ways to improve my Health and loved ones thank you so much for taking the time and making these presentations goes to show that improving our health during this time will always go a long way God Bless America </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> It depends on the individual health </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> How much is that Vitamin C & D. Dr.Mike </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Thank you...Folks, re-read the video's title ...The answer is, YES, take your vitamins ( C and D) and minerals(Zinc and magnesium) and eat your antioxidants ASAP... Do not wait for Vaccines....Mandatory, forced vaccines...Line up...Wait, Don’t be me. I am an M.D. but let me tell you what you do not know about vaccines and what I didn’t know and what 90% of all M.D.'s do not know and what No politician knows... I did not know that Vaccines had not been tested against any placebo (ever). I did not know that animal testing would be skipped for the future COVID vaccines..I did not know the 30+ ingredients used in vaccines. I did not know that there are neurotoxic aluminum and mercury molecules in vaccines. I did not know enough to research vaccines before vaccinating my own children. 
I did not know that my own precocious, active, talking son would be vaccine-injured. 
I did not know that my own baby brother (also an M.D.) would become paralyzed (Guillain-Barre) and then die after his swine flu vaccine in the same hospital (Shands) where he had received his medical training. 
I did not know that my mother(an R.N.) would get 8 vaccines in 1 day to "catch-up" with newly added CDC vaccines to keep her job as Head Nurse in the Largest Hospital in the county and then get such severe, aggressive, progressive brain fog in days and become unable to dial a phone or push an elevator button or remember any of her  5 children in a few weeks and then have this "dementia" progress and then die in diapers
I did not know that vaccines were given a blanket indemnity from liability in 1986 and now total immunity for all COVID vaccines for the future. I did not know that we gave more vaccines than any other country starting on day #1...I did not know that we have the highest rate of SIDS of the top 35 industrialized countries... I did not know that we had more autism than any other country... I did not know that Vaccines could injure an infant's brain. 
I did not know that vaccines can result in autoimmunity and neurological damage. I did not know that herd immunity does not apply to vaccines and is a myth created by the CDC. I did not know that Vaccines have almost no effect after about four years. 
I did not know how emotional the topic would be and how angry people would be at me for just asking questions about Vaccine Safety. I did not know that pediatricians were paid to give vaccines. I did not know that the CDC owned the Patents on so many vaccines. 
I did not know that the NIH stands to make Billions of dollars on a COVID vaccine. 
I did not know how angry at myself I would be for not knowing. I did not know that the CDC committed fraud and destroyed their evidence in their vaccine safety studies when it showed vaccines can cause autistic neurological changes..I did not know that a whistleblower came forward with all the evidence but he was silenced. I did not know that Merck committed fraud in their vaccine research repeatedly. I did not know that aluminum molecules in the vaccine ingredients is connected to brain inflammation and brain inflammation has been proven to be connected to autism. 
I did not know that vaccines contained human cells from aborted fetuses..
I did not know how much mainstream media would censor the independent research that showed these facts...I did not know that 90% of all vaccine research that the CDC and FDA use to "approve" vaccines are done by the scientists hired by vaccine makers..I did not know if we were alone... I did not know how many other millions of parents and families in the world have been affected by vaccine reactions..
I did not know how many would find, join, and share the Facebook help group= Vaccine Support Group on Facebook..I did not know that FB would delete the scientific medical research that had been suppressed, deleted, or censored until it happened to us...  Dr.MAS.. </COMMENT 14>

<COMMENT 13> Chinese doctors say people who are infected but who do not show symptoms can transmit virus. The ability of transmitting virus varies among such people, some stronger, some weaker.
http://sh.xinhuanet.com/2020-03/09/c_138857378.htm European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says "It is currently believed that people who are infected but who do not show symptoms cannot transmit the virus." I would trust Chinese doctors who are fighting the virus on the front line! What a tragedy! Is this because of language barrier? Or over confidence? https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/novel-coronavirus-china/questions-answers </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> What is "positive asymptomatic"? Can "asymptomatic" people transmit virus? The reporter invited Chen Dechang, the chairman of the National Critical Care Medicine Committee and director of the Department of Critical Care Medicine, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine to explain this.

"asymptomatic" people can transmit virus to different degrees, varying from strong to weak transmission level

Chen Dechang, who is currently treating critically ill COVID-19 patients in ​​Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, remembers that as soon as he arrived in Wuhan, the person in charge of the hospital stated that a small number of medical staff in the hospital showed positive in the throat swab test, but there were no symptoms of lung inflammation. To ensure safety, the hospital still keeps them in isolation.

"In general, asymptomatic positive is asymptomatic infection." Chen Dechang said that, like many other diseases, since the outbreak, there have also been a certain number of asymptomatic people who carry the new corona virus. "Generally speaking, this group of people has a strong immune function, and even if the body carries the virus, it will not cause large numbers of reproduction of virus or cause tissue and organ damage." Asymptomatic people have strong or weak ability to transmit the virus. When the virus load in the body reaches a higher quantity, it will have a stronger virus transmission capacity, but if the virus load in the asymptomatic one is lower, the ability to transmit the virus will also be relatively weak.

In addition, different virus subtypes have large differences in their ability to spread. Chen Dechang introduced that the National Science Review, sponsored by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, recently published a paper jointly completed by researchers at the Bioinformatics Center of the Peking University School of Life Sciences and the Shanghai Pasteur Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Recently, 149 mutation points were generated, and two subtypes have evolved, namely, the L subtype and the S subtype, which show great differences.

"The S subtype is a relatively older version, which is more similar to the bat-derived coronavirus in the phylogenetic tree, and is not as strong in transmission; the L subtype is more invasive and more infectious. This time in the Wuhan epidemic area, Large-scale transmission is more closely related to it. "He introduced that after studying 149 mutation points, scholars found that the L subtype is more common, accounting for 70%; the S subtype accounts for 30%. But whether asymptomatic infections are mostly S subtypes requires further understanding. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> I went to the Cortland NY Guthrie hospital last night and they refused to test me for anything but flu which was inconclusive. I had every symptom of covid19 and told them it's the sickest I've ever been. They gave me ibuprofen said that's all they can do there are no test for anything other than flu. So they say..
I probably don't have coronavirus but it would be nice to know foresure is a test really that expensive, that they can't afford to waste one. </COMMENT 15>

<COMMENT 14> As a clinical laboratory scientist, I must stress the importance of 4:10 </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Whish I had found this sooner I came as close to death as I would of liked. I did go to the hospital and because they found no risk of imminent death they just sent me home, never did a covid-19 test because I had no cold type systems, been having chest pain, trouble breathing and almost blacked out that's why I went to hospital. few days later my chest pain got worse so on to the internet I went spent hours digging and came across what is called a pulmonary embolism (blood clots in the lungs) stopped reading and said to my self "blood clots aspirin helps with that" off to find aspirin, found some in a first kit and within a few hours my chest pain had gone. been taking 2 a day every 3-4 days it has been 6 weeks now and I am slowly getting better and  no matter how hard I push the pulmonologist still wont see me until the end of August   the medical system has about failed me. or and before I forget my prime doctor the one that referred me to the pulmonologist said it is just my C.O.P.D. and chronic bronchitis. my point is all this is to say don't totally rely on your doctors </COMMENT 15>

<COMMENT 20> Would it help if prothrombin time or INR can be done before the blood thinners are given, which means that the hospital laboratories need to keep enough stokes of the kits. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 5> Oh great.  I can't get toilet paper, I can only get horribly scented bleach, and I can't get any sanitary stuff. Now I won't be able to get BCG.  I didn't really want it, but if I actually needed it, I'd be really upset for people blabbling about how useful it is.  Right now, all I want is some isopropanol.  I'm done worrying at all about covid when I can't get stuff to prevent or clean much more prevalent infections or a real mask to prevent cancer. </COMMENT 5>

<COMMENT 19> I had the BCG vaccine as a teenager in the Uk before Uk stopped vaccination about 10 years ago. I still caught CV19 and had a really rough time. Sick for 8 weeks. So the initial vaccine I had didn’t protect me or the 50000 dead in the Uk. Maybe this genetic modification can have more protection but a lot of Europe’s stopped BCG vaccination programmes....... </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Should be thanking all frontliners and medical health workers for their service. They play a big role to combat this pandemic. Mass testing should really be done as soon as possible.
Does anyone know where can I buy Covid-19 Antibody testing kit? </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 14> Discovering viruses inside the body is like discovering sugar, salt, calcium, lipid in the blood or discovering sperms or ovum inside the reproductive organs or even discovering that we have a heart that beats. It is just stating the obvious. Fact is that we are a storehouse of millions of germs including viruses, bacteria that have been living inside our bodies from birth to death but do not cause any infection. Infection is caused only when our immunity power becomes weak and then too our bodies fight it out by itself thus making our bodies stronger than before. So please stop listening to the Pro $$$ titute media that has been paid a hefty package running to millions to spread this scaredemic called corona. Remember its the media that has played the satans role of spreading corona fear from the days of wuhan in december until the present and this has to be taken care of or else it will continue to ruin our lives. </COMMENT 14>

<COMMENT 14> This pandemic is a huge farce I repeat this pandemic is a huge farce fact 1 as humans our immune system becomes stronger against viruses and sickness if we have contracted the virus 2 this so called virus has been blown out of proportion to the point that every one hides behind a mask WHICH WILL NOT PROTECT YOU FROM THE GOD DAMN DISEASE if you are stupid enough to believe that a mask will prevent you from contracting the disease your dumb AS FUCK this whole pandemic is a way to lower our immune systems so that way either when the next more deadly disease will kill so many more people that the world population will drop astronomically  or so that the social elite can make more money off a new mandatory vaccine because us humans finally got it through our thick fucking skulls that the flu mutates every year and the vaccine that they give you is for the previous years strand of flu so it is up to us humans to make the decision to either be with the 99% of people who believe this and are following the media like mindless sheeple or the 1% like me who are smart enough to realize that this whole thing is completely made up and we have no reason to worry about this so called pandemic and to all the people who will reply with things like “actually we should be very worried cause we’re a bunch of mindless fucking sheeple who HAVE NO IDEA HOW EVOLUTION WORKS AND WERE TO RETARDED TO FOGURE IT OUT WITHOUT OUR MOMMIES HOLDING OUR HANDS ALL THE THROUGH THIS BUT OH WAIT WERE NOT ALOUD TO BE WITHIN 6 FEET OF EACH OTHER

<COMMENT 17> The new coronavirus pneumonia is the influenza of unknown cause of death in the United States.

Asahi TV reported that as early as February 7, the United States CDC stated that "The symptoms of new coronavirus pneumonia and influenza are very similar." Some symptoms of new coronavirus pneumonia and influenza are the same, e.g., fever, cough, runny nose and shortness of breath. So, the United
States does not test these influenzae of unknown cause of death, and only generalize them as the influenza of unknown cause of death.

China has successfully tested these U.S. influenzae of unknown cause of death that are caused by the new coronavirus. Now these U.S. influenzae of unknown cause of death is called as new-coronavirus pneumonia. But unfortunately, China's successful test has not been appreciated by all countries of the world, but has been accused by all countries of the world under the leadership of the United States. If China adopts the U.S. approach, i.e., does not test influenza of unknown cause of death, and only generalize as the influenza of unknown cause of death, China will not become the source of the new coronavirus. </COMMENT 17>

<COMMENT 1> Thank you very very good point </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> The most important thing about the video is how it reflects on the contexts that society must be very clear about the Covid-19, the appreciation it makes so that those who watch the video generate criteria to differentiate what a syndrome is and how it is it is a symptom and how these influenced the impact of each country. In my reflection of the video on this pandemic for my consideration, we have also forgotten how this problematic affected social and economic levels of each family in the world, it is said that poverty increased by 30% and malnutrition in children by 45%. </COMMENT 2>

<COMMENT 20> One day, I too will become just a number. 1/500th of an LED in a YouTube video.
Think the wave may pass over me this time. One day it won't though. Just hope it matters.
Use my number well. Learn from it. Get better. </COMMENT 20>

<DESCRIPTION> Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced that another 111 people have died in the UK after testing positive for coronavirus, the lowest number since the ... </DESCRIPTION>

<COMMENT 1> Total crap and they know it, there's more than twice the amount of deaths due to the covid -19 unreported that patients wasn't tested espically in March and April that not on the total amount of deaths so Matt give us the correct total 100,000 more like it.As it's alot worse than previously thought no wonder it's been mishandled from the very start an investigation is needed </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Says COVID-18 instead of 19 😂 </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Even with the Tories' desperately fiddled figures (far below the reality), UK has officially 2nd most Covid deaths in the world, behind Trumpland. Only 6 other countries have even 1/4 the number of deaths. Setting aside San Marino and Andorra, both tiny enclaves in Covid hotspots, UK is 2nd behind Belgium for deaths per million. Little wonder the Tories don't show the international graphs- and the media cover up for them. Catastrophic handling of the crisis by blustering buffoon Boris, his Dominatrix Cummings and Goings and their cronies, and yet he is proud of what they have done! Failure with herd immunity policy, care homes (didn't even bother to count the deaths for a month), PPE, testing (too late, missed targets and had to fiddle the figures) and tracing. Now they'll be making face coverings compulsory on public transport after saying face masks were counterproductive, and they are to quarantine foreigners, despite having already allowed thousands in for football matches from raging Covid hotspots. Oh, and Cheltenham races was another breeding ground they were warned against. They should be hung, drawn and quartered </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> LOOK  AT  THESE  IDIOTS  NIOT  WEASRING  MASKS????   WHAT MORONS  WE HJAVE  IN  GB????   JUST   TAKE  A  LOOK  AT  WHAT   CHINA  IS  DOING </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> I love that there is 2 k dislikes </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Any one notice it says Covid - 18 </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> This lot are a disaster </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> So WHY the empty testing centres in the UK ? 
Why did thousands of tests from the UK have to go to the US and why do they need to be redone ? 

Why cant the politicians JUST BE HONEST and answer questions people WANT answering? </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Ain't everybody fed up with this bollocks by now. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> BACK TO NORMAL NOW, WHY DO THEY PUT OUT THESE CRAP FIGURES WHEN THEY KNOW THERE CRAP,  359 DIED YESTERDAY , 39,728 SECOND HIGHEST IN THE WORLD </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> https://youtu.be/f33y0Fv_DFA </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> This is no time for Levity!. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> From Wednesday 20th may 2020 to Wednesday 3rd june 2020
15 days.
Positive infections:  31.188
Deaths: 3.942

And it's "under control" " with the action plan working" " we are all on the same side"
A shameful and insulting speech to the British voting public 😔 </COMMENT 13>

<COMMENT 17> I think it to early to lift the lock down what about the infection </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> There needs to be an investigation into how the NHS has played a role into deaths in care homes by sending elderly patients with covid19 back into care homes. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> What about this death? R.I.P Emily Jones: https://www.amren.com/news/2020/04/her-name-is-emily-jones-white-seven-year-old-brutally-stabbed-to-death-by-somalian-immigrant-in-british-park/ </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> If the reports are correct, and Matt Hancock did not release vital information from pandemic modelling a few years ago, which lead to countless deaths due to not being prepared, he needs to be in jail! </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 14> This pandemic is a huge farce I repeat this pandemic is a huge farce fact 1 as humans our immune system becomes stronger against viruses and sickness if we have contracted the virus 2 this so called virus has been blown out of proportion to the point that every one hides behind a mask WHICH WILL NOT PROTECT YOU FROM THE GOD DAMN DISEASE if you are stupid enough to believe that a mask will prevent you from contracting the disease your dumb AS FUCK this whole pandemic is a way to lower our immune systems so that way either when the next more deadly disease will kill so many more people that the world population will drop astronomically  or so that the social elite can make more money off a new mandatory vaccine because us humans finally got it through our thick fucking skulls that the flu mutates every year and the vaccine that they give you is for the previous years strand of flu so it is up to us humans to make the decision to either be with the 99% of people who believe this and are following the media like mindless sheeple or the 1% like me who are smart enough to realize that this whole thing is completely made up and we have no reason to worry about this so called pandemic and to all the people who will reply with things like “actually we should be very worried cause we’re a bunch of mindless fucking sheeple who HAVE NO IDEA HOW EVOLUTION WORKS AND WERE TO RETARDED TO FOGURE IT OUT WITHOUT OUR MOMMIES HOLDING OUR HANDS ALL THE THROUGH THIS BUT OH WAIT WERE NOT ALOUD TO BE WITHIN 6 FEET OF EACH OTHER

<COMMENT 17> The new coronavirus pneumonia is the influenza of unknown cause of death in the United States.

Asahi TV reported that as early as February 7, the United States CDC stated that "The symptoms of new coronavirus pneumonia and influenza are very similar." Some symptoms of new coronavirus pneumonia and influenza are the same, e.g., fever, cough, runny nose and shortness of breath. So, the United
States does not test these influenzae of unknown cause of death, and only generalize them as the influenza of unknown cause of death.

China has successfully tested these U.S. influenzae of unknown cause of death that are caused by the new coronavirus. Now these U.S. influenzae of unknown cause of death is called as new-coronavirus pneumonia. But unfortunately, China's successful test has not been appreciated by all countries of the world, but has been accused by all countries of the world under the leadership of the United States. If China adopts the U.S. approach, i.e., does not test influenza of unknown cause of death, and only generalize as the influenza of unknown cause of death, China will not become the source of the new coronavirus. </COMMENT 17>

<COMMENT 1> Thank you very very good point </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> The most important thing about the video is how it reflects on the contexts that society must be very clear about the Covid-19, the appreciation it makes so that those who watch the video generate criteria to differentiate what a syndrome is and how it is it is a symptom and how these influenced the impact of each country. In my reflection of the video on this pandemic for my consideration, we have also forgotten how this problematic affected social and economic levels of each family in the world, it is said that poverty increased by 30% and malnutrition in children by 45%. </COMMENT 2>

<COMMENT 2> Ozone therapy and Plasma therapy

Dr Amato De Monte director of the anesthesia and resuscitation department of the University health compagny of Udine treated 36 covid-19 patients in Italy
 with ozone therapy. 
All patients had pneumonia with respiratory difficulty and were doing oxygen terapy with a cap or helmet.

All patients improve after 3-5 ozone therapy sessions.

Many patients were discharged from the hospital and the only patient who was subsequently intubated was extubated.

You don't have to wait for the patient to be intubated but you have to start treatment in the early stages.

After the first cases treated by Amato De Monte, a clinical trial began in various italian hospitals with ozone therapy.

The results have been excellent, they can be read on the website www.ossigenoozonoterapia.it or you can write to info@ossigenoozono.it

Dr Giuseppe De Donno head of the pneumology department Carlo Poma of Mantua in Italy has obtained excellent results with plasma therapy.

He also treated a pregnant woman with plasma therapy, he was the first in the world. </COMMENT 2>

I mean, is there like a "Ploymerase or some thing" that can live in the blood to trick the virus that it's a cell. and ask it to openup the  RNA?

2. Is it even possible to create a Spliceosome that tamper the virus RNA?
 if so, can we get it into these "type 2 pneumocytes" ? </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 14> There are many variables that make this presentation incomplete. This should be  compared and combined with other data and re-evaluated. For one, not a single "lilypad" is the same. Some are healthier than others. Second, lets not forget the impact of the environment we live in. The world is a big place, and some places are downright toxic for humans but a breeding ground for viruses, and vice versa: some places are good for humans to live in, but are deadly for viruses. There are just too many other aspects that, when taken into consideration, would deliver a more accurate presentation -- especially since we've learnt a lot more about the virus by now. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> So 'flattening the curve' means 'lengthening the curve'? </COMMENT 15>

<COMMENT 1> Total crap and they know it, there's more than twice the amount of deaths due to the covid -19 unreported that patients wasn't tested espically in March and April that not on the total amount of deaths so Matt give us the correct total 100,000 more like it.As it's alot worse than previously thought no wonder it's been mishandled from the very start an investigation is needed </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Says COVID-18 instead of 19 😂 </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Even with the Tories' desperately fiddled figures (far below the reality), UK has officially 2nd most Covid deaths in the world, behind Trumpland. Only 6 other countries have even 1/4 the number of deaths. Setting aside San Marino and Andorra, both tiny enclaves in Covid hotspots, UK is 2nd behind Belgium for deaths per million. Little wonder the Tories don't show the international graphs- and the media cover up for them. Catastrophic handling of the crisis by blustering buffoon Boris, his Dominatrix Cummings and Goings and their cronies, and yet he is proud of what they have done! Failure with herd immunity policy, care homes (didn't even bother to count the deaths for a month), PPE, testing (too late, missed targets and had to fiddle the figures) and tracing. Now they'll be making face coverings compulsory on public transport after saying face masks were counterproductive, and they are to quarantine foreigners, despite having already allowed thousands in for football matches from raging Covid hotspots. Oh, and Cheltenham races was another breeding ground they were warned against. They should be hung, drawn and quartered </COMMENT 3>

A shameful and insulting speech to the British voting public 😔 </COMMENT 13>

<COMMENT 18> There needs to be an investigation into how the NHS has played a role into deaths in care homes by sending elderly patients with covid19 back into care homes. </COMMENT 18>

<COMMENT 1> False </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Tests are fake. They send in examples of motor oil, fruit and animals pretending being people and the came out positive. https://youtu.be/s4p8DM8rKJI </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Viruses cannot be tested. This everyone knows!! </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Why do doctors always have the need to probe peoples holes? There is no way i am going for this test unless they come up with a less invasive method of collecting the specimens. I am also not going for a prostate exam. The US the other day said they have evidence that aliens exist. It enough having to worry about aliens probing your ass. You dont have to go to a doctor to have your ass probed. The aliens are already among us. Never let any doctor anywhere near your holes. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Order your own COVID -19 Antibody (IgG) blood test in the link below! No doctor or insurance is needed. Pay online and receive your lab requisition by email. It couldn't be any easier.

<COMMENT 9> Excessive dependence of humans on tools and machines to diagonse disesase has become the bane of modern medicine. The result of this is that perfectly healthy humans are converted into patients merely by the readings of the tools and machines. For example, a healthy person is branded a diabetic patient just because the readings show an elevated blood sugar level which in itself means nothing. Then starts the actual business of life long dependecy on modern medicines which are bascially chemicals that do not cure but only treat the sugar level while makiing the person internally weak by cuasing damage to the vital organs like heart, pancreas and kidenys. similarly, testing for corona virus in the body which is already livinng in harmony in our bodies from birth to death amongst crores of other germs is only misleading and trapping people by branding them as corona patients. Fact is having the corona virus is not equal to having the corona disease but the media, IMA, IMCR ,the governemtn and pharma lobby is making us believe as though a mere virus inside our body is the same as having the disease. We need to understeand this conspiracy of the medical system or else we will continue to suffer as 'patients' for newer and newer diseases in addtion to existing but manufactured diseases like diabetes, heart problems, kidney problems, asthma etc. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Business of fear. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> I got the test yesterday </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Turkey give  PCR test for free. up until not 1.8 million people are been tested. 150K  was positce and 110K has recovered.  With tourism Turkey will test every one comming to Turkey at the airports with PCR and they will send the test result within 4 to 6 hrs per message to your phone,  only then you will be allowed to leave or not </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Can this test found HIV IN SAME TEST </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Bonsoir
Le discours n'est disponible qu'en anglais ? </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Let me give you 2 examples from commercially available PCR tests being used these days , I shall quote from the labels, the company labels that come with these tests : - Abbott : "Positive results do not rule out bacterial infection or co-infection with other viruses...Due to the high sensitivity of the assays run on the instrument, contamination of the work area with previous positive samples may cause false positive results" ; - Accula : " Cross-reactivity with respiratory tract organisms other than those listed in the Analytical Specificity Study may lead to erroneous results…" : what they are saying is : we cannot guarantee through our test that you are positive to sars-cov-2 because our test may confuse sars-cov-2 with everything else, any other kind of RNA in your cells or other things !!! It´s a hoax, it´s a swindle, it is global pharma nazism to terrorize us all into buying their useless and harmful vaccines and drugs and face masks and disinfectants that will only cause one allergies and poisonings, and accept total control of our lives, contact tracing etc., under the false pretext of a pandemic that does NOT exist. 
THERE IS NO SARS-COV-2 virus no covid disease no pandemic it´s all a pharmanazi hoax for profit :

" Dr. Mullis wrote, on May 7, 2013:“PCR detects a very small segment of the nucleic acid which is part of a virus itself. The specific fragment detected is determined by the somewhat arbitrary choice of DNA primers used which become the ends of the amplified fragment. “ </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> How long can Corona be in someones system for, as in can be tested for? Minimum and maximum amt of days or weeks, the average days more or less for your avg person who is healthy and gets it </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> shes reading from a script.... "order follower" </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> So if you "own" the lab by donating to them, you can fake as many stats as you want as its done entirely by computer programmes? </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> "FDA has approved a few rapid tests that give results in less than an hour" so what this means is dozens of countries created a PCR Test, hoping they would "hit the jackpot" financially and get approval, showing a corrupt underpinning financial structure? And this is why Korea want to try to "show themselves" expert at containing the virus and publish low virus stats, to get their PCR Test to get FDA Approval and win massive cash benefits?? </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> As a virus can remain in low viral load in your body, and the PCR test supposedly can find "a needle in a haystack" why can this test not detect you had it in the past, recovered, and now have it in low viral load? </COMMENT 20>

We can go outside again </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Stay Clean Kids. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> There are many variables that make this presentation incomplete. This should be  compared and combined with other data and re-evaluated. For one, not a single "lilypad" is the same. Some are healthier than others. Second, lets not forget the impact of the environment we live in. The world is a big place, and some places are downright toxic for humans but a breeding ground for viruses, and vice versa: some places are good for humans to live in, but are deadly for viruses. There are just too many other aspects that, when taken into consideration, would deliver a more accurate presentation -- especially since we've learnt a lot more about the virus by now. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> So 'flattening the curve' means 'lengthening the curve'? </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Let’s not forget about the other ways people will suffer with this virus as some politicians keep people from working. Must be nice to be rich and not worry about such things. Perhaps shove sock people into nursing homes...yeah, that’ll help. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> 1.If we would have listened when they announced the corona virus it wouldn't have blown up inner face and less people would've died
2.they showed two different places one graph showing how much people got sick from going to the a parade in  Philadelphia  in 1918 when the worst influenza hit and there was over 200,000 people who attended and they lost 4,500 people but in St. Louis after two days detecting the first case they shut everything down the graph was lower then Philadelphia 
3.exponential  growth is scary but doesn't last forever </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> infection </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Almost 2 thousand people are dumb enough to understand the current issue we fight. </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 3> I feel like someone is cornering Covid-19. Excellent job. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> COVID-19 patients have ARDS symptoms, but they DO NOT actually have ARDS! 
WHY? Because there is no ACE2 Blocked Receptor CAUSED REDUCTION IN ALVEOLI SURFACTANT IN NORMAL ARDS!  And furthermore, COVID-19 patients DO NOT have "tired" diaphragm muscles or any danger of heart failure (unless they have a pre-existing heart disease co-morbitiy, which is not the norm).

That is why doctors, after inadvertently causing the death of tens of thousands of COVID-19 patients, have begun to turn patients face down, so the excess lung fluid does not inhibit oxygenation until the virus can be gotten under control, and, instead of intubing the patient with a ventilator, given them high-flow nasal cannulas (HFNC).
Hyperparic Oxygen would be an even better therapy.

<COMMENT 7> Excellent description.. 
Thank you very much </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Prevention and risk reduction : https://youtu.be/kQLVrTB4Jog </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> or if you lungs are being 'cooked' by millimeter microwave 5 gee.  Being rolled out RIGHT NOW ALL OVER THE US!... Liars. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> A recently published Swiss study performed a virtual screening of over 606 million compounds with the ambition to discover novel inhibitors for the SARS-CoV-2 main protease. To this date, the study marks the most extensive computational screening for the discovery of SARS-CoV-2 Main protease inhibitors: https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Inhibitors_for_Novel_Coronavirus_Protease_Identified_by_Virtual_Screening_of_687_Million_Compounds/11923239 




They report two natural compounds, (-)-taxifolin and rhamnetin. 

The first shows the best potential among the natural compounds. Remarkably, it is engaged in six direct hydrogen bonds with the Mpro which represents the highest count observed in the selection of compounds. Since hydrogen bonds are a key determinant for drug speciﬁcity, (-)-taxofolin might oﬀer a naturally occurring alternative to the proposed inhibitors CP-1 to CP-12.

The isomer (+)-taxifolin, which is more common in plants, was predicted to have less favourable binding free energies. However, the persian walnut (Juglans regia), Agrimonia pilosa, and japanese cypress (Chamaecyparis obtusa) among others are known to produce glycosides of (-)-taxofolin oﬀering a natural resource for its extraction. 

Glycosylated ﬂavonoids regularly show an increased bioavailability compared to the aglycon. In the organism, these glycosides are cleaved oﬀ by β-glucosidase in the gastrointestinal tract or liver. Since the aglycon already exhibits acceptable pharmacokinetics in rabbits, glycosylated (-)-taxifolin will likely display improved bioavailability as well. 




Taxifolin 3-O-glucoside isomers, [(2R, 3R)-, (2R, 3S)-, (2S, 3R)- and (2S, 3S)-] were isolated from leaves of Chamaecyparis obtuse (Cupressaceae). The (2S, 3S) isomer is a synonym of the (-)-Taxifolin 

https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10575630290033141?journalCode=gnpl19




So according to the results of the Swiss study, Chamaecyparis obtusa leaves can be used as a source of (-)-Taxifolin glycoside to inhibits the virus Main protease (3CLpro) in addition to the use of its oil as a source of phytoncides to mimic the “forest bath” effect.




Interestingly the study also found that among the FDA-approved drugs, Apixaban showed the highest potential, while Rivaroxaban and Betrixaban came 4th and 5th respectively, all three are anti-coagulants. 

We already know that blood clots are common issue with COVID-19 patients. It has also been shown that as a consequence of the elevated presence of blood clots among some COVID-19 patients, high plasmin levels are found. Plasmin was shown to promote the virus entry into cells using ACE2 by cleaving its spike protein: https://neurosciencenews.com/coronavirus-blood-clotting-16185/  https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00013.2020?utm_source=PRV&utm_medium=PressRelease&utm_campaign=4.16.2020&  




Apixaban and Rivaroxaban are already being used in protocols for treating COVID-19 patients in several hospitals, for example: https://emergencymedicinecases.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/COVID-19-Anticoagulation-Algorithm-version_final_1.1.pdf  




So their potential to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro may add up to the logic of using these drugs with COVID-19 patients as anti-coagulants.




The study screening process:

In the ﬁrst step, they performed a shape-based screening with known binders for the SARS-CoV-1 main protease and relevant 3 substructures as template molecules. After the initial shape screening, two diﬀerent docking protocols were applied followed by the assessment with pharmacokinetic ﬁlters to narrow down the number of potential binders. Clustering based on molecular ﬁngerprints was applied to ensure structural diversity of the compounds that were, in the next step, subjected to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Based on the obtained trajectories, the binding free energy of the ligands was quantiﬁed using Molecular Mechanics/Generalized Born Surface Area (MM/GBSA) post-processing. In the last step, they assessed potential toxic eﬀects of the compounds due to the interaction with 16 known oﬀ-targets to make a ﬁnal selection of 12 compounds. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Why is obesity such a problem with covid-19 is it because you have to administer air/oxygen according to weight?  Maybe because circulation is already affected by extra weight? </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> How can we find out if people who are dying of coronavirus have had the flu shot or multiple years of flu shots? How can this information be obtained? If the inflammation is being caused by an overreaction of the immune system, could this be caused by the flu shot? However, if the severe cases have not had the flu shot, then this would be a positive for getting the flu shot. Curiously, nothing about this is mentioned. I wonder why? </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> it is clear by the reaserch done in italy. its clot ! in china they have done only two autopsy, in Italy are doing a proper study through autopsy. anticoagulation teraphy is the most likely correct answer. ventilator are killing people and we all know that! </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Another great presentation. As a cardiologist I appreciate the information and the way it is presented. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> If ventilation is relatively intact and perfusion is compromised why is VA/Q ratio LOW?
It is supposed to be high isn't it? </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Thank you Dr. Seheult for being a voice of scientific reason during this very scary pandemic. With respect to the risk of possible lung injury by using ventilators to treat ARDS as opposed to treating symptoms of HAPE, could you address your thoughts on the possible use of Acetazolamide, Nifedipine and Phosodiesteras Inhibitors as potential countermeasures to treat the symptoms of Covid-19. For your convenience,  a link to a relevant paper published from the Cureus site is provided. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340066464_COVID-19_Nifedipine_Phoshpdiesterase_Inhibitors_Acetazolamide </COMMENT 16>

<COMMENT 19> Are you afraid of death? Not sure what I should do? Jesus is the solver. Jesus is the savior. Jesus is the only light in the chaotic world. Satan deceives you. What has Satan given you? It's all about cheating, lying, killing, stealing, and perishing. Come to Jesus. Rest and receive eternal life. In front of Jesus' name, all powers and demons kneel down. I am the way, the truth, and the life. Only  comes to the Father except through me. John 14: 6
You who want to believe in Jesus.If you who have COVID19, come to Jesus. Be healed in the name of Jesus, If you plagued by ghosts. If you wanna believe Jesus, Please say this words. "Jesus, I believe in Jesus. Jesus is the Son of God and my savior. you poured water and blood on the cross for my sins.And Jesus were resurrection in three days and I believe Jesus come back when in last world time." </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 4> A lot of doctors are beginning to think maybe mechanical ventilation may not be correct initially. Some of these pts are coming in with SATs of 50% with no distress!  They are not struggling to breathe as with ARDS. They have named this happy hypoxemia! A Dr Joseph Fair had the virus and waited too long before calling 911 and going to the ED. They asked him if he wanted to be intubated. Naturally as a doctor he said no. Instead they gave him very high % oxygen. It worked. A lot of frontline doctors are rethinking immediately going to the ventilator. </COMMENT 4>

Green tea component epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) also inhibits ; counterintuitively nicotine also lowers it. The pharmaceutical minocycline can be helpful. I hope this helps. </COMMENT 6>

<COMMENT 11> Is is true, as I have read, that 50-80% of covid-19 patients who go onto a vent die on the vent? If it is true, then we shouldn't look at the vent as a life-saver, or rather we shouldn't think that if we get into that kind of trouble, the vent will save us. It won't save a large percent of those who go onto one, and even it you do survive, you may have sustained significant lung damage that will be with you for the rest of your life. So I would think that the main life-saving, if it is to occur at all, would happen by the proper treatment early on, 'before' ventilation becomes the only resort and too often the 'last' resort. </COMMENT 11>

<COMMENT 18> As a Respiratory Therapist of 33 years, We also used etoh as a bronchial dilator which also broke the surfactent level   of the mucus bearer That made it possible to sucking the fluid out every 2 -3 hours. We called it or nick named it as a COPD  Cocktail.  Today the use of Peep and negative pressure on the newer Ventilators is simply outstanding. There is another form of life saving measures being carried out , and , that is Hyperbaric  ventilation. Used , for a wide variety of traumas  to the lung. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> They did this to my mother but still she was unable to survive the reason was ARDS due to COVID19. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Congratulations!
The video is very well made in that it gives so much detail and I enjoyed it thoroughly.  
I am not in the medical profession but I have an immense hunger for knowledge and research, to equip myself with the facts and because the video was so in detail it sent my mind on further research to make sure I understand all fully and that process is leading to a question.

I understand from the video that during “Covid-19” the interstitial fluid in the interstitial space becomes inflamed [03:43] and because of the inflammation in the interstitial space spontaneous diffusion between the oxygen in the alveoli and the capillary is strained or even not existent at all and therefore the need to be incubated with a ventilator so assist with breathing during ‘Covid-19”

My question is: 
If the inflammation present in interstitial space renders spontaneous diffusion between alveoli and the capillary impossible then it appears the situation will not be remedied by a ventilator because even if one tries to breath normally, use a CPAP, another device or a ventilator surely the blockage cause by the inflamed interstitial fluid is present in all cases which make spontaneous diffusion labored or not possible, and I don’t believe that a ventilator can clear up the inflammation in interstitial space to begin with.  Can you please elaborate on this.

thanks in advance

<COMMENT 1> Thanks, doc! </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Have you heard anything about it causing photosensitivity in kids? </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> I have conjatacviate I am afraid if it's because of covid 19 helo </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> what if I don’t touch my eyes and noses, mouth. Is it risky the dust ( might have virus) on the ground flying around to my face </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Yes you do have a wonderful voice </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> PL.explain with more pictures less words </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> I had nothing but allergies because eye drops for allergies and byndril helped my eyes and I kept having to blow my nose I’m better now. I think it was Monday by eye was nearly swollen shut but it’s better </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Great job explaining. Glad you can help out with the pandemic. Be safe everyone.  Would love everyone support my new YouTube channel about EyeHealth and Designer Eyewear. Check it out and Subscribe. Thanks </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Please asymptomatic, incubation 30 days?  Explain mutations and how easy it is to genetically manipulate. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> would regular eye drops like clear eyes or visine kill off this eye thing if you believe you have an eye thing going on.  My eye has been a bit red and  watery with mucus type secretions a bit more last few days....but I feel no other symptoms </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> So what do you do if you think that you have Covid-19 in your eyes?  Will drops like preservative-free Refresh help?  How about swimming in the ocean if you have Covid-19 in the eyes -- would that be good or bad, or neither good nor bad?  And how long should it take for a full recovery? </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Turning Age forty has its disadvantages and this includes failing eyesight. It`s extremely vital that you take a good, pure supplement to keep your eyes and eye sight healthy. I`ve got only started utilizing this eye sight advancement method “Tοsazο Zuzo” (Google it) lately. There are indications of improvements to my eye-sight now. Should have started this before.. . </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> You need to prove that these viruses stated in animals rather than labs.  Common sense says if viruses could jump from the animal kingdom to humans we would have been extinct thousands of years ago.  No these viruses are signs of amalgamation which has already been done with animals and plants.  However, God is judge of these things. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Thank you for sharing your info on the covid virus. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Most healthy people most likely will have very mild symptoms or no symptoms at all </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Everyone needs to keep an eye on this! </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> genetic manipulation, CRISPR gene editing, biowarfare..... don't be naive, you are too well educated to accept it on "face" value. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Done subscribe. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> I have been completely recovered from corona for a little over a month now. I’m still getting more and more of my sense of smell and taste back. Corona can kill your ability to smell or taste. Sadly, yes. I smoke cigarettes. I can’t smell them hardly. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Does anyone agree that this virus was created in a lab in wuhan china and unleashed it on the U.S. as a BIO-WEAPON! </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 4> Doc you're so handsome 😁 </COMMENT 4>

<COMMENT 6> Could you have the virus and not feel any symptoms? </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Briefly put you are going to die in the end anyway.  Then why do we have 45% recovery.
What causes recovery, and who are the type of people that will recover. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Doctor Mike, I am john sometimes i talk to my-self back at febuary whether Aspirin, Anti-inflammatory Drugs and Antibiotics Would help to slow down the mortality rate of Covid-19 or to shorthen hospitalzition time </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> As long as your immune system is on point your good. ;) drink lots of vitamin C. Youll be ok. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Hi friends - just prayed for our healthcare workers & those suffering.  God bless them all.  Like many, I'm home, staying safe.  I'm a senior citizen with, unfortunately, major medical issues.  Living on my SS check. I wrote a little book & am hoping the royalties will help me out a  bit - 365 Knock-Knock Jokes (by R. Myers - Amazon).  If you get a chance, kindly check it out.  I do wish everyone the best & hope this crisis ends ASAP.  Stay safe & help out your neighbor.  WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> The answer is very simple... There is no covid-19, they’re just relabelling deaths of all other causes. Wake up the people. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> I found out on the notification. 
Thanks </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> How will I know if you replied to my question about homeless people having herd immunity? I'm so super curious.

Thank you,
Tom </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Doctor Hansen, I thought in early March 2020 all the hospitals located in the capital of every State would be so overwhelmed and  packed with patients that it will be so catastrophic because of the homeless people unfortunately in positive note as a whole Country it wasn't as bad as I previous thought. There was only some Capital Cities. So my question to you sir since all the videos I've seen on YouTube not only from you but others as well that you are one of the best ones, so back to my question does homeless people have herd immunity??????
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TEACHING AND SHARING YOUR KNOWLEDGE TO THE WORLD.

<COMMENT 16> They still didn't need to take so long to give us the bodies of our two dead relatives. The state kept the bodies against our will, which was okay except that it took so LONG to retrieve the bodies for a funeral and THEN we had to do a funeral via telecommunication and  video equipment, which I'm grateful exists (what did they do in 1918?) but it did NOT feel normal.
They played 'Nearer My God to Thee' and I couldn't handle it, even though I'm only a Step- person; step, as in step-mom. My step kids' grandparents, my new husband's ex- parents-in-law. This calling people "step" daughter, "step" son and "step" mother feels really cold during a funeral proceeding. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> And this will kill only 2% of the people that get it???? </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> First I clicked, then I watched the whole thing. Why do I do this to myself? </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> You look like Nick Kroll </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> So it's a death sentence.. And modern medicine cannot stop this.. Its hopeless then.. So let's enjoy life and stay close with our love ones for tomorrow we die then.. </COMMENT 20>

SARS CoV-2 causes COVID 19. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Warning! The moment you are reading this. There is a deadly virus that is killing millions! So help yourself by washing your hands when you’re going to eat. Also, bring some hand sanitizer when you go out so your hands stay clean. Stay safe, friend. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> I LOVE your citations at the end. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Study based on china mortality so some fact are wrong because china miss guiding with data </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Honestly, you can’t even get a break off of the news carrying on about COVID-19, I’m not saying that they shouldn’t but nobody actually gets it anyways most of the time. I can’t even cough or sneeze once without some imbecile thinking I have the "Coronavirus”. In my opinion everyone is kind of taking it a bit too serious. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Where's your proof that it went into a pangulen? Or are you being a parrot. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> It's sad that it took COVID-19 to bring us together. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> So somebody shagged a Pangolin after stuffing a dead Bat up it's arse and that's where this codswallop comes from,Thank fuck our government loves us. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Best Covid19 SarsCov2 awareness video..

Although people MUST wear face masks while going out.. Symptomatic or not..

Hats off for the tribute to Dr. Li in the end.

<COMMENT 2> Bruh I just got outta basic and there were 20+ cases of Covid in my platoon alone. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Currently at basic and just finished during this, covid made this crap suck at fort Sill </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> covid-19 free testing sites are giving you fake results sometimes they tell the truth </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Get your freakin distance soldiers </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> The lockdown paranoia has gone on long enough. Change my mind </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> I was wondering about the impacts this pandemic has on the Army, weeeekkkks ago. I wasn't finding any really informative videos about this. Thank you Insider! </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Basic training not boot camp </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> We spent a lot of money on army but not on things that matter </COMMENT 9>

<COMMENT 11> Holy crap my last name is Brito too! </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Us ARMY "boot camp." What? BOOT CAMP? </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Hey! Tactical dispersion! </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> So if none of them are sick going in, and they continue to do screenings, they've been in for more than 2 weeks and still no cases, why tf do they gotta social distance </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> The United States has encouraged Belarus to conclude and adhere to
agreements with the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
on the program of macroeconomic stabilization and related reform measures, as
well as to undertake increased privatization and to create a favorable climate
for business and investment. Although there has been some American direct
private investment in Belarus, its development has been relatively slow given
the uncertain pace of reform


how about u treat "europeans"(russians) the same way u treat
arabs mr trump?


uncertain pace of reform means i take ur money and do nothing


shame on the usa </COMMENT 15>

<COMMENT 2> merci pour la video courte et simple cela va être utile pour mon projet d'ecriture </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Jai une bpco  stade 2 avancée...auel serait la conséquence avec se virus qui attaque directement les bronche sur ma santé ?   évidemment j'attends pas une réponse d'elle...peut quelqu un et dans ma situation.... </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> J'ai attrapé le covid19 le mois dernier. Certes je me sens guéri actuellement mais j'ai l'impression d'avoir une insuffisance respiratoire. J'ai du mal à respirer comme avant. Cette insuffisance n'est pas accentuée car il m'arrive de faire des activités physiques mais jsuis vite essoufflé du coup que faire pour retrouver ma respiration à 100%
Sur une échelle de 1 à 10 ( ma capacité à respirer)
Disons que j en suis à 7 
Merci de me répondre </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> ...ne dites pas "il n'existe pas de traitement" c'est faux, la chloroquine combinée à l'azithromycine, qui est un antibiotique, en est un et il fonctionne dans la majorité des cas traités ! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfiUlVpqHfE </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Bonjour, Avez-vous eu des retours sur une atteinte du myocarde après avoir contracté le covid-19 ? Merci </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> une reaction immunitaire(inflammatoire) hors controle par l'organisme lui méme,c'est la redoutable toxicité de ce virus.
comme si l'infection devenait une maladie auto-immune .
Neamoins ce phenomene est connu, semble -t-il,dans d 'autres atteintes pulmonaires, comment ce fait il,que nous
soyons si demunis de solutions? </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Vous dites qu'il s'agit d'eau dans le poumon mais est ce comparable a un oedeme pulmonaire dans quel cas l'usage de diueretique pourrait s'averer opportun ? </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Bien Le Bonjour , pouvez vous nous expliquer le protocole de réanimation ? Par exemple pourquoi doit-on retourner les malade sur le ventre ... ? </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Ça s'appelle une embolie pulmonaire </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Si il y a une réaction exacerbée de nos défenses immunitaires qui engendre une forte inflammation est ce que les immunosuppresseurs sont protecteurs ? </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Pourquoi certaines personnes deviennent-elles gravement malades à cause d'un coronavirus, alors que d'autres sont asymptomatiques et ne ressentent presque rien?

Trois raisons :

·   Les problèmes de santé (86,5 % des décès à New York présentent au moins une comorbidité)

·   Choix de mode de vie

·   Vos gènes

Analysons ce dernier point.
Si vous comprenez vos gènes, vous pouvez mettre en œuvre des changements de régime alimentaire, de compléments et de mode de vie qui peuvent optimiser votre santé et vous rendre plus résistant au COVID-19 et aux complications qui y sont liées.

Nous sommes au XXIe siècle et nous ne devrions plus avoir besoin de nous fier aux suppositions généralistes du XXe siècle pour savoir ce qui peut aider alors que la connaissance des prédispositions permet d’adapter plus efficacement les stratégies préventives.
Ceux qui ont fait séquencer leur génome disposent des outils nécessaires pour se concentrer sur l’utile et comprendre ce qui pourrait les aider en examinant leur ADN.

Nos gènes peuvent nous dire si nous avons des variantes à risque ou non qui :

·   Nous rendent plus susceptibles de contracter un coronavirus

·   Nous rendent plus susceptibles de développer des complications

Certaines sociétés analysant le génome sont capables d’établir une liste interne de recommandations permettant de contrecarrer les variantes génétiques qui pourraient vous mettre en danger.

Trois exemples clés :

·   Le gène ACE2 - Entrée dans vos cellules

Considérez les récepteurs ACE2 comme des portes d'entrée pour le coronavirus, car c'est ainsi qu'il peut pénétrer dans vos cellules.
Plus de récepteurs ACE2 signifie plus de portes pour que le coronavirus puisse facilement entrer dans vos cellules et les « hacker ».

Votre gène ACE2 joue un rôle important dans le nombre de récepteurs dont vous disposez.
Certaines variantes sont associées à une expression accrue des récepteurs ACE2, si bien que si vous êtes porteur de cette variante, vous pourriez être plus susceptible de contracter le virus.

L’intérêt de savoir est que si vous savez de quelle variante vous êtes porteur, vous saurez quelle mesure préventive vous devez prendre pour essayer d'empêcher que vos récepteurs ACE2 ne facilitent l’entrée du COVID-19.
L’analyse personnalisées permet de prendre des mesures préventives basées sur vos gènes.

 

·   Gène MX1 - Empêcher le virus de se propager

Le MX1 est important pour la réponse de l'organisme aux virus qu'il n'a jamais rencontrés auparavant.
Comme le COVID-19 est nouveau, ce gène joue un rôle important dans la lutte contre les coronavirus.

Le gène MX1 code pour une protéine qui aide à empêcher les virus de se répliquer et de se propager dans l'organisme.
Malheureusement, les coronavirus peuvent supprimer cette protéine, ce qui permet aux virus de se reproduire sans que le MX1 ne les en empêche.

Cependant, certaines variantes génétiques permettent au MX1 de fonctionner par d'autres moyens, malgré l'interférence des coronavirus.

Si vous savez que vous possédez la variante à risque du MX1, assurez-vous de mettre en œuvre certaines recommandations spécifiques.

 

·   Gène IL-6 - Tempêtes de cytokines

Le gène IL-6 est SUPER important pour le COVID-19. 
À vérifier en premier quand c’est possible.

Ce gène est associé à 3 aspects liés au COVID-19 :

·   Sensibilité aux infections respiratoires

·   Tempêtes de cytokines

·   SDRA (syndrome de détresse respiratoire aiguë)

Les tempêtes de cytokines surviennent lorsque le système immunitaire surproduit des cytokines inflammatoires, qui endommagent alors notre corps au lieu de le protéger.
De nombreux chercheurs et médecins sont de plus en plus convaincus que beaucoup de décès dus au COVID-19 sont dus à des tempêtes de cytokines.

Un excès d'IL-6 contribue à de dangereuses tempêtes de cytokines, et il existe même un lien direct entre le taux d'IL-6 et la gravité de l'infection virale.

Non seulement ces associations génétiques existent, mais elles sont étayées par des études qui montrent que les niveaux d'IL-6 dans le sang sont en corrélation avec la gravité de la maladie et la probabilité de complications.

Les professionnels de la santé s'accordent désormais sur l'importance de l'IL-6 lors des complications du COVID-19.

C'est pourquoi, si vous avez été séquencé, vous devez vérifier si vous avez les variantes du gène IL-6 qui augmentent ces niveaux et peuvent vous prédisposer à des infections respiratoires plus graves, vous laissant plus vulnérable au COVID-19. </COMMENT 12>

<COMMENT 2> why are labs being allowed to create and develop new viruses anyway , as we have seen recently all it takes is for one mistake and hey presto we are all done for with the chance of a vaccine practically zero , all research into the development and manufacture of these viruses should be stopped with immediate effect and then that way they could put their effort into finding cures for ones that already exist . </COMMENT 2>

<COMMENT 7> Wake-up, people. The planet and our country have been shut down by hysteria and fear. Masks, social distancing, and contact-tracing are all SNAKE OILS being sold to us. Don't buy into it. It is silly to be walking around wearing a mask and praying for a vaccine when we already have a cure. HCQ and CDS (MMS). HCQ is cheap, effective and has been in use for 70+ years. Big pharma and the medical mafia can't make a dime on it so it must be shown to be "scary" so they can push the new expensive, patented, and exclusive drug and vaccines that will certainly have more risks. People, look at the fine print on all of the medications you take right now before you talk about the risks of taking HCQ as a preventative or cure. </COMMENT 7>

Coronavirus was "discovered" in 1963 ~ year with which I have much familiarity; Fauci is right about the Quinine thing as that is for Malaria and in the hands of a licensed trained person may have compassionate use benefits off-label which are correct for an individual person yet Zinc adjuvant Quercetin  is readily available despite  valid rebuttals - this oddly has a G-String ( lewd connotation intended ) which has no precedence prior to genomic tampering consequent to tools that never existed before; </COMMENT 14>

<COMMENT 17> Seen some comments like “why the porter did not use gloves?”  Reason is because there’s 2 Nurses who are present during the procedure . Nurse A will go inside , donned on full PPE, bring this biohazard bag —> do swabbing —> put inside that biohazard bag. Nurse B (usually we address them as the circulation nurse) on the other hand will put on the necessary PPE and will stay outside with a red box (the one which the porter will carry). Inside the red box will container a big plastic bag and another biohazard bag. Once nurse A has completed swabbing and placed the swab in a biohazard bag, he/she will open the door and “throw” into the 2nd biohazard bag in the red box without touching anything . Nurse A will close the door. Nurse B (using clean gloves) will seal the biohazard bag number 2 and will tie the plastic bag containing the biohazard bags and specimen. She will then remove his/her gloves , handrub/hand wash and wipe down the red box (although no one touched it) and call the porter to come and send it to the lab. Basically , It’s called double / Triple bagging. Hope this clarifies 😄 </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Thank you for everything... </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> use masks from swissprotect.life and dont worry </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 5> the British government could prevented all this if they just shut down the borders from the start.  But they was dragging their feet trying keep airlines happy and we had thousands of infected people coming in to the UK.  Australia on the other hand shut down borders strait away they hardly got any deaths now.  I hate the UK government they haven't got a clue and  what makes it even more laughable they want to open boarders back up again. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Idiotic government! Do anyone remembers Coronavirus? </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> A nurse friend, working with infected patients told me that the deaths they had with infected patients, there were other major health issues. Nephew of a friend is one of the Covid deaths but, he had been through all unsuccessful treatments for myeloid leukaemia and had been given a couple of months to live. </COMMENT 7>

<COMMENT 1> You do know that tik tok is a chinese app that spies on you, even if you dont post in tiktok, they still have access on your device's information,  so YALL SHOULD DELETE TIKTOK </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> It's really obvious this virus originated from Wuhan Lab, obvious! </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> shit im scared. What if the next Pandemic become Zombie Apocalypse? Shit. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> This virus released to gain profits from manufacturing testing kits and killing older people to save the money that the governments spend on the elderly. Test kits in pharmacies between £60-£170. What is the point of knowing if you have covid 19 or not. Just wear mask to protect yourself and others and don't waist your money. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> WE ALL KNOW THAT THIS VIRUS IS MAN-MADE. IT IS THE BEGINNING OF WAR AGAINST CHINA. THEY MUST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> We know it was enginered by Chinese Virologist Shi Zhengli, the CCP did this on purpose and needs to pay, all the proofs which you can research for yourself and all checks out is in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMdgtIlSYpg </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Yes this is a bio virus </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> The article in the daily mail British Newspaper told the truth the article headline why us outsource bat virus to wuhan lab China for 3.7million of tax payers money in 2014-2015 </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Yes, the Bat Lady has been working on this virus for years...she altered the genetic code to make it more infectious to humans. See the Epoch Times documentary. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> This covid 19 is more like a movie. Someone made the virus to make it I don't know , maybe to take their enemies down or something. And,now everyone has to  suffer and survive including me😔. It pisses me off, it makes me sad I don't know what to feel anymore , the Chinese government should pay for this.😠 </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> It's not a question, it's the obvious, this virus is obviously made by humans, wouldn't be surprised China had the aim to stop some protests with it maybe?... People and power, such a bad combination, the whole world should throw down current leaderships and start allover by real chosen people!

Personally anything from China is a boycot for me, join the resistance! </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> My dad got it 🦠 </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> I swear to God I’m not lying my dad. Got the virus </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> The question is when this China will have to pay their damages around the world? I will not buy anything made in china! </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> look a china/american woman talking about China hmmm that's coincidence 🤣🤣🤣😂🤣🤣 </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> so china, finally showing your cards huh? </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> THIS IS NOT GOOD AT ALL I WILL NO LONGER EAT CHINESE FOOD AGAIN I WILL NEVER BUY ANYTHING MADE IN CHINA </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> bill gates together with his eugenics beastly mates are behind this man-made COVID 19 </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> What i found out was,

America had caught the virus first. It originated from a man in his early 30’s with 2 children and a wife. The virus was spread through America and people were obviously travelling to China at the time then the Chinese had caught the virus.

And the public had made rumours it started from eating aborted babies and bats. </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 4> That vacine needs to start now so that the virus can be gone and go away </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Ppl. please do your part to make sure they do not rush out this particular vaccine.  This will be the first vaccine to use nanotechnology and synthetic mRNA.  All the other vaccines use an inactivated virus from a living source.  Even Bill Gates said thousands could have serious side effects or death from the coming COVID vaccine.  I have been writing to the government to please not "warp speed" this vaccine.  They have to get it right! </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Because of covid-19 a lot of people with knowledge  in the field of vaccine  preparation have did a good job.Whether covid-19 will have a vaccine? What is the possibility of a vaccine for covid-19? What is its  potentiality? Is the actual remedy to save life is the production of a vaccine for covid-19? Why all the  vaccines so far  produced for covid-19  by the so called experts were failed?  Is there no other remedies? There are a lot of questions never answered. </COMMENT 6>

I do wish everyone the best & hope this crisis ends ASAP.  Stay safe & help out your neighbor.  WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Crazy Pro-vaxxers and gates have to be stopped.  What nut would take a vaccine from an elite profit motivated eugenicist,  who is a friend of pedophile Epstein,  who has injured and killed African and Indian children and sterilized it's victims with his poison vaccinations and from an elitist who is for depopulation. The brainwashed Pro-vaxxers need to wake up.
To favor Bill gates and his vaccinations you either have to be evil, ignorant or just plain stupid.  Please help stop the insanity of Pro-vaxxers.  Their dumb blind faith and allegiance to corrupt big pharma is a danger to the health of all people.
What will it take for these idiot pro vaxxers  to realize how evil the system is?   What will it take to teach these pro vaxxers critical thinking skills?  How do we get pro vaxxers to detox the aluminum out of their brain so they can think for themselves?

<COMMENT 1> we have nothing else for dengue.  everybody’s obsessed with this  antibodies are supposed to be protective. it turns out that low levels of antibodies cannot neutralize the invading viruses, they  bind to them then they effectively usher them into susceptible cells. in the cells  the viruses  replicate.having had one type of dengue increases your risk of having severe illness if you have a second infection. if you have never had dengue do not get the vaccine.  with this covid antibody level is expected to become less over just one year of time that is the way it seems to work for immunity to these type of viruses. we are going to go there and maybe we will end up just fine. </COMMENT 1>

<COMMENT 4> Have u noticed how his voice doesn't match his lip sync ........?!?!??? </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Thank you....It is all enlightening and I feel even more will be learned...Just like the next major topic= Vaccines....Don’t be me. I am an M.D. but let me tell you what you do not know about vaccines and what I didn’t know and what 90% of all M.D.'s do not know and what No politician knows... I did not know that Vaccines had not been tested against any placebo (ever). 

I did not know that animal testing would be skipped for the future COVID vaccines..I did not know the 30+ ingredients used in vaccines. I did not know that there are neurotoxic aluminum and mercury molecules in vaccines. I did not know enough to research vaccines before vaccinating my own children. 

I did not know that my own precocious, active, talking son would be vaccine-injured. I did not know that my own baby brother (also an M.D.) would become paralyzed (Guillain-Barre) and then die after his swine flu vaccine in the same hospital (Shands) where he had received his medical training. I did not know that my mother(an R.N.) would get 8 vaccines in 1 day to "catch-up" with newly added CDC vaccines to keep her job as Head Nurse in the Largest Hospital in the county and then get such severe, aggressive, progressive brain fog in days and become unable to dial a phone or push an elevator button or remember any of her  5 children in a few weeks and then have this "dementia" progress and then die in diapers.

I did not know that vaccines were given a blanket indemnity from liability in 1986 and now total immunity for all COVID vaccines for the future. I did not know that we gave more vaccines than any other country starting on day #1...I did not know that we have the highest rate of SIDS of the top 35 industrialized countries... I did not know that we had more autism than any other country... I did not know that Vaccines could injure an infant's brain. 

I did not know that vaccines can result in autoimmunity and neurological damage. I did not know that herd immunity does not apply to vaccines and is a myth created by the CDC. I did not know that Vaccines have almost no effect after about four years. 

I did not know how emotional the topic would be and how angry people would be at me for just asking questions about Vaccine Safety. I did not know that pediatricians were paid to give vaccines. I did not know that the CDC owned the Patents on so many vaccines. 
I did not know that the NIH stands to make Billions of dollars on a COVID vaccine. 

I did not know how angry at myself I would be for not knowing. I did not know that the CDC committed fraud and destroyed their evidence in their vaccine safety studies when it showed vaccines can cause autistic neurological changes..I did not know that a whistleblower came forward with all the evidence but he was silenced. I did not know that Merck committed fraud in their vaccine research repeatedly. I did not know that aluminum molecules in the vaccine ingredients is connected to brain inflammation and brain inflammation has been proven to be connected to autism. 
I did not know that vaccines contained human cells from aborted fetuses..

I did not know how much mainstream media would censor the independent research that showed these facts...I did not know that 90% of all vaccine research that the CDC and FDA use to "approve" vaccines are done by the scientists hired by vaccine makers..I did not know if we were alone... I did not know how many other millions of parents and families in the world have been affected by vaccine reactions..I did not know how many would find, join, and share the Facebook help group= Vaccine Support Group on Facebook..I did not know that FB would delete the scientific medical research that had been suppressed, deleted, or censored until it happened to us...

<COMMENT 6> The amount of propaganda is the problem! </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> The video pertaining to the Biology and Evolution of Covid 19.Mr.Subramani and the Three Guest have given very good useful resources about the Covid 19 virus. And also what to be expected about the second out break of the corona virus Pandemic. And from my perspective the corona virus has its Advantages and Disadvantages and there so much to learn and gain about this Virus. When someone test positive for the corona virus immune system is low or weak lack of Vitamins A,B,C,D,E,K for strong immune system with healthy eating Habits drinking plenty of water also daily excerise. Hand washing, Social distancing,Wearing Masks. Stay safe everyone Be well. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> I am a BIOLOGIST.    What is with the testing?  Don't  have it today but after the test have it tomorrow.  The virus is in the body of junk eating PEOPLE all over the world. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> boiler-plate molecular virology, milk-toast "nice tree!" tell-nothing phylogenetics, pipe dreaming about molecular-evolutionary constraints.  But the biology of cov19 that truly matters now is the mass action of the epidemic dynamics (mainly the asymptomatics!) and these dynamics' side effects in the form of patients overwhelming hospitals.  Asymptomatics are nuclear to the dynamics but here they show up for 1 microsecond. </COMMENT 9>

<COMMENT 11> IM STILL WAITING AS TO WHEN TRUMP DUMMY WITH THE TRUMP DUMMY SYNDROME IS GOING TO DECORATE THE SURVIVING PERSONNEL. THAT WAS DEPLOYED ON SECRET MISSION THAT IM SURE WAS PERFECTLY EXECUTED AND THE BRAVERY THAT IT TOOK TO FIRST HANDLE AND FIGHT THE NEW VIRUS? OR AN OLDER NEW ONE AGAIN FOR YOU KNEW WHERE TO GET THE EBOLA VIRUS TO PLAY WITH. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> How ironic is it that none of these big pharma educated, financed, propagandist meat puppets never mentioned how accurate are these RT-PCR test, why Koch postulates have never been used to prove that this particular virus really is the cause of this disease, and why did then inventor of the RT-PCR stated emphatically that this test should not be used in diagnosing infectious disease! I will be patiently waiting for their answers. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> ITS EASY TO DRAW MAPS AND CLAIM THAT YOUR MAP IS CORRECT, BUT THE WARSHIP AT SEA CAUGHT THE VIRUS FROM WHERE? I THINK THEY HAD IT FIRST CAUSE IT WAS THEIR MISSION TO INFECT THE WORLD UNDER TRUMP DUMMY DICTATORSHIP DO WE ALL LOOK THE OTHER WAY, AND PRETEND TO BE UNAWARE.  YOUR MAP THE FIRST LINE,  START WITH THE WARSHIP. THERE WAS EIGHT HUNDRED PLUS INFECTED WHEN COMING TO PORT, THE VIRUS WAS WITH THEM BEFORE THE CRUISE SHIPS GETTING THE VIRUS, ALSO THE SHIP HAD THE FIRST DEATH CASES OF THE AMERICANS THAT WAS NOT DISCLOSED AT THE TIME DUE TO TOP SECRET MISSION. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Hiya to all of you the fantastic Four. As per Elizabeth's comments below. Thankyou. </COMMENT 14>

<COMMENT 17> Nice discussion. Unfortunately, the medical professional has become big business, promoting profit over practice and are now as corrupt as politicians. I remember when I was younger, it seemed the medical profession and especially medical insurance companies were "non-profit".
Now it only matters the bottom line. no more Chickens for a checkup. If they remained non-profit and the government offered grants to offset the greed factor, there could still be innovation among the brightest scholars. The jury is out on the current leaders in the medical profession, everything from competition and theft of patents, to actually illegally involved in the cause for many viruses. Two things are fact. The leading mouthpiece for CV-2 held back a cure for HIV when he could have saved millions of lives, and he also bragged about the effects of HCQ while it was still under patent. We need to fire all the Doctors in suits and bring in good old fashion country doctors whos' first and ONLY responsibility is to their patients. My outlook in life is, if you do good work, you will win praise and wealth. It should not be automatically given to people who make educated guesses for a living, with little to no accountability.
If someone came out with a pill that cured or prevented Cancer, they would be suicided before they reached the patent office. Take the many zero-point energy inventors as a vast example. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Very ideal hosting and presenting 👏🏻 </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Why don’t I know of anyone with it?  When the flue is going around I’ll typically know of about five people at any time with it.
So many lies.  I had a weird cold flue in January like many other people I know.  It lingered.  That was probably the Wuhan virus back then.
It is said that it probably arrived in North America in October.
The economic shutdown is probably a NWO agenda. </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 2> The controversies are all for politic reasons... Fake studies just keep coming out because of politics. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> In the way back machine When people started speculating that they could buy masks at a low price and sell them back later, that is a sign that the market is anticipating that they would be of some Marginal benefit. The alphabet soup organizations  lost all legitimacy when they came to confiscate people who took these precautions and market actions. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> the main risk of mechanical ventilation is an infection, as the artificial airway (breathing tube) may allow germs to enter the lung. This risk of infection increases the longer mechanical ventilation is needed and is highest around two weeks. Another risk is lung damage caused by either over inflation or repetitive opening and collapsing of the small air sacs Ialveoli) of the lungs </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Please answer this question..are parents being irresponsible not putting masks on infants and small children esp. at places like walmart...I think ...please give me your opinion and knowlegde.. luv your channel!! </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Use mask... or learn how to not spit when you talk? </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> I do not have high expectations for organizations like WHO, whatever mistakes made by them, although dissapointing, is not surprising. I can not say the same thing about what happened with Lancet and NJM. In times of a sanitary pandemic I place part of my faith and trust in science, not religión or mankind. That's why what happened with HCQ studies is unacceptable. But life must go and science must repair the damage done by other men. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> i love all your videos and from the bottom of my heart thank you for doing them.  the only problem i have, and have ever had with any of your videos is this part right here.  the way he says "healthy" is different when wearing a mask, and not wearing a mask.  i still believe we should be wearing masks yes.  but i dont think he had to exaggerate during the demonstration.  a real pity and shame. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> White people are extroverts, they can't spend time alone and need some freedoms. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Amazing stuff here, thanks for the video!! </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> You should always be wearing a mask when dealing with patients or people 😒 </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Looks like the WHO has been using an experimental drug and it is called "RIOTS" to cure covid19 </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Please please please  you  have the attention of so many healthcare professionals....please keep an open mind to treatments that perhaps are not the established standard western  protocol as we need to remain humble and open minded . Likewise, we must critically examine the standards we now have and remain open to the possibility that they may not be what we have been taught  to believe—to the point of breaking down our beliefs down to the very fundamentals we were taught. It’s painful but necessary to look at the narrative and motives of all these things so that we remain true to that oath Primum non nocere. ***Conscious discernment not indoctrination.*** </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Blackstrap Molasses For covid hematology?
Potential Impact of Blackstrap Molasses on COVID-19 symptoms ?
Blackstrap Molasses is rich in iron which should affect heme molecule binding </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Absolutely love your content, it is my go-to source for updates. Will be donating after my next paycheck. I will say though that I will not personally be even remotely considering a vaccine for another 5 years. It is void of logic to me to witness how vigilant almost every country has taken measures to insure that as little people as possible get exposed or infected. Only then to suggest we infect and expose a lot of people. Not a fan of pathogenic priming. Not a fan of rushed vaccines. Mainly, not a fan of the very corrupt history of vaccine safety data manipulation. I'm gonna pass and go for keeping my immune system strong. 🙏 Love the work though and the vaccine trial resource is great. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> The implications of this news is BIG

Gates and others…NEEDED to discredit the success of HydroxyCloraquine and Zinc on Covid 19

100% success rate by doctors and high level medical professionals


Some weeks ago a report came out about HydroxyCloraquine being dangerous on the heart.

The authors of this statement have since retracted that report!!!

As it also turns out….this report has Gates fingerprints on it


The authors NOW say they can- "No longer vouch for the veracity of their primary data source”


The original headline stated- 

 An influential medical journal article that found hydroxychloroquine increased the risk of death in COVID-19 patients was retracted on Thursday, adding to the controversy around a drug.” 


But here’s one of retractions.

https://www.statnews.com/2020/06/04/lancet-retracts-major-covid-19-paper-that-raised-safety-concerns-about-malaria-drugs/ </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Please dont wear mask while sleeping or while alone at home or while driving your own car. Wear the mask only when needed. Mask will become harmfull if you wear it 24/7 for long periods of time. You think thats obvious? I know few people that wear it when alone at home too. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Guys wear Masks. Ignore these intelligent people from WHO, CDC etc. They lack common sense. Wear masks, stay safe. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> I read in Nature's daily briefings that ca. 1/3 of covid-19 infections occur in the GI tract with further serious and lasting damage to multiple organs, even after the virus is undetectable.  Why so little attention to this oral route-chronic damage? </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Government is very clever. They are very good at intimidating people. They do what they want </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 1> Some of you have noticed an error in this film. We incorrectly used footage of South Korea when talking about China. Thank you for flagging our mistake—a corrected version of the film is being uploaded. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> More control over our money. Big surprise from the Rothschild economist. Don’t want it go pound sand. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> The US System is transparent and also highly compatative. Even after printing nearly two trillion dollars in the last ten years there is negligible inflation. The world trusts the dollar you can take it anywhere. It was surprising that the Economist's financial corrosspodant does not know how dodgy the assets of Chinese Banks's are and how difficult it is to move Yuan Out of China. In olden times this story would not have moved beyond the fact check stage. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Thanks </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> You thought transparency is a problem? Well what about the U.S using S.w.i.f.t which is supposed to be “neutral” to further its own agenda. Disgusting </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Could America recover their manufacturing? The need for gloves and masks as well as ventilators showed me our vulnerability as well as weakness and dependence on Chinese manufacturing </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> It's funny how brainwashed u Americans are, sleeping down on China. Not knowing how tricky the Chinese are actually becoming. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> His accent is hard to understand! </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> How can a intentionally deflated currency gain confidence on the international market? </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Corruption, oligarchs and communism this makes China unstable. It is just a matter of time when they fight it out. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Short Answer : No
Long Answer : Nope </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Reasonableness: it will take years to recover the real economy. The pandemic is not the worst thing that happens to us but its consequences on production, consumption, employment and investment. And there are no written manuals about it for solutions. Thanks! </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> They already have, how by buying up US debt, properties,  introducing electric vehicles. All actions that will end the US petrodollar economy.  Also Russian petrodollar economy. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> They're going to ruin the whole money concept with new technology without anything physical to make it more than numbers. Someone will brake numbers. Money should be global and at a fixed value, based of a physical back stock. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> 😂 </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> 4:08 Financial institutions say China is a safe bet - really??? The ones with substantial Chinese assets no doubt. Just don't ask for a audit report or try and get your money out..... and never question the CCP </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Its not a question of if, its a question of when </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> China is not to be trusted because it is a communist. This is a propaganda. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> How could we be the king of global finance if we owe China billions of dollars, that’s just ludicrous , if you owe someone money who has more money and greater financial control? </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 5> Please continue 👍 good job </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Dibayar tenaga medisnya makanya cuk </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> And now we're facing the crazy new normal..

Why something abnormal still called normal, ohh no not normal..but new normal.. </COMMENT 7>

<COMMENT 14> Remember..In the beginning China try to covered-up this pandemic covid-19 and backed by WHO.....I see all comments below blaming the government and the people....Look what happened in the world? Look what Happened in European Countries so called had advanced health-care system? And in THE US? They're panicked...unprepared...Indonesia archipelago is one of the most populated country in the world...and I Believe the government had done a marvelous job to overcome this pandemic..against all odds!! Did China let the who to inspect this pandemic? No.....!!! </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Don’t get infected by the virus if you’re an Indonesian. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Because of conspiracy theories, more and more Indonesians are believing that COVID-19 is a hoax so it won't get any better. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Meh, CNA. Making the condition like as if its the end of the world. They forcaste indo economy survive in the pandemic, and we are not hitting the recession up until now, is the prove of it. No massive lock down what so ever. Unlike Singapore, the CNA headquarter that already hited by recession. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Be ignorance is our tradition </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> high death rate because the people tested is so little ...up to now only 250K out of 250 mil .   but I agree our response is too late </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 1> It's amazing how soon we forget about Covid-19 once they stopped talking about it over a week ago. 

Just shows how brainwashed people are; being told what to think and when to think about it. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> 200,000 people showed up to DC to protest yesterday and Covid concerns was no where. But I'm sure the media will blame Trump if the protesters get the virus. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Is there any proof that Chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine sulfate benefit any patient’s to feel better? </COMMENT 3>

<COMMENT 7> They are all actors spreading propaganda. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Why is the media not getting other scientists to weigh in on the pros and cons are about what we are doing in terms of dealing with the COVID-19 Pandemic.  NO person knows enough to emphatically state what will happen or what needs to be done.  Please go to this link https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m1924.  Yes, using history is logical but in studying the peer reviewed studies, if you take the time to keep up with them, you will see that there are no hard dogmatic principles and timelines in many cases.  I would like to see more hard sciences used to address the problem in an unemotional manner. </COMMENT 8>

<COMMENT 12> *Vaccine is factor.* But the *other factors* causing deaths are:

1) *ignoring* normal fever. 

2) the normal fever on getting severe *heats up* the body. 

3) this heated *temperature* of  body results in *covid -19*

4) when the patient is taken to hospital. He is forced to be *isolated from her family*

5) the absence of family member gives the *feeling of unrest* 

6) then doctor *also* isolate u. 

7) patient with *hardly runing breath* waits for death to come. 

8) doctor says we tried our best. Patient says no doctor is around. 

Same thing occurred to my Father. He left for hospital at *9:AM* 

No hospital accepted him until *5:PM* . 

On *Wednesday* night he had breath problem. 

On *Thursday* he left the world. He was physicaly very fit

He was admitted in the same hospital (KMC)  which *refused to admit him thrice.* Due to *Red Tapism* . 

*On forth time* wandering here and there in the city the *same hospital* (KMC) *admited him.*

And after *One hour* they informed us with the bad news

<COMMENT 3> Very nice updates, am regular follower. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> At the initial stage of positive corona  virus sign take nutritious food and eat two Murunga seed after food every time and drink water for about 20 days and see the result.It will no way harmful to our health.RABINDRA </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Congrats on getting all of your videos back on YouTube! </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Sad how people are still so deathly terrified of and obsessed with a virus with an IFR of 0.26% or less. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> I think we should eliminate the current education system... and start teaching every person science and medicine because that’s important information... and what schools now teach is mostly useless. They now spend years repeating the same useless things, like force kids to read books and give book reports, etc. Once a person learns to read , which for most people would take literally 1-2  months, they should start learning whatever things people already in those fields know what is most important. Right? </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Good job MedCram community for pushing back on Youtube and Google! Finding this out gave me goosebumps! Great news folks! </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Why don't you speak about this study: *Influenza vaccination and respiratory virus interference among
Department of Defense personnel during the 2017–2018 influenza season by Greg G. Wolff?* </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> No mention of Ivermectin this time?? I`ve been booted off Facebook three times now for suspicious behaviour for posting about it. Didn`t even try to get back on this time but I also mentioned it to BBC researchers on a radio station several times and it was never mentioned there either. Does it scare big pharma that much? </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Mexicali and Tijuana are both bordering US. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Great video! If thrombosis is a consequence of ACE2 receptors being disabled we might also see it with SARS1 (since that binds to ACE2) but not with MERS, and not with influenza viruses. I don't think we do see it with influenza or everyone wouldn't be saying it was unusual and a new thing with COVID-19.

 I found this SARS1 autopsy: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12781536/. Patient 3 had "Epithelial denudation with fibrin thrombi present in pulmonary vessels". Might be a coincidence.

I think some people are speculating that SARS2 is actually infecting endothelial cells. But if that were the case wouldn;t autopsies find viral RNA in other parts of the body? I don't think any have. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> So glad that YouTube got sensible about MedCram videos. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> I have read studies on the affect of N-acetyl cysteine in relationship to pulmonary hypertension. The studies have contradicted themselves, with some showing (in rats) that it increases PH, while in others it is suggested that NAC may be a treatment for PH.

I am currently supplementing with NAC and have hypertension. I started on this supplementation after viewing your videos on COVID 19. 

Could you please clarify this NAC PH connection? Perhaps you can address this in one of your videos. 

Thank you very much. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> I thought the Coronavirus can withstand hear up to 197 degrees? </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Kindly check the Fabunan Antiviral Injection in the Philippines particulary the ingredients thank you </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> There hasn't been a corona virus that caused a pandemic since the Spanish flu you idiot. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Shame on Google, You Tube and Twitter for their unlawful censorship.  Hope AG Barr uses MedCram example in coming policy changes and Anti-trust actions. </COMMENT 18>

<COMMENT 20> Strategic Culture report: The report focuses on the “manifold and heavy consequences of the Corona measures” and warns that these are “grave”.
More people are dying because of state-imposed Corona-measures than they are being killed by the virus.
The reason is a scandal in the making:
A Corona-focused German healthcare system is postponing life-saving surgery and delaying or reducing treatment for non-Corona patients. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 18> They said it's most effective for mild cases and did not state the death rate. IN THE MEANTIME, AN AMERICAN DOCTOR HAS CURED ALL CASES OF COVID-19. DR. THOMAS YADEGAR, HAS DEVELOPED A MEDICAL BREAKTHROUGH IN THE TREATMENT OF COVID-19 BY DEMONSTRATING A 100% CURE RATE OF HIS PATIENTS AND WITHOUT HAVING TO LEAVE PATIENTS ON RESPIRATORS. DR. YADEGAR IS THE ICU DIRECTOR AT PROVIDENCE CEDARS-SINAI TARZANA MEDICAL CENTER IN CALIFORNIA WITH 20 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE AS A PRACTICING PHYSICIAN. DUE TO HIS SUCCESS WITH COVID-19, HE NOW SUPERVISES TREATMENTS FOR PATIENTS AT 6 HOSPITALS REGIONALLY. NBC TV NEWS IN CALIFORNIA REPORTED HIS CURE, APRIL 1, 2020. A TRANSCRIPT OF A INTERVIEW WITH DR. YADEGAR, IN WHICH HE SUMMARISES HIS CURE, IS ONLINE AT THE NEWS SECTION FOR THE NEWS OF APRIL 28, 2020 ON THE GLENN BECK RADIO SHOW WEBSITE. IN THE US, IT IS OFTEN SAID IN THE NEWS THAT UP TO 80%, OR MORE, OF THE COVID-19 PATIENTS PLACED ON RESPIRATORS DIE. TO COUNTERACT THIS, DR. YADEGAR DEVELOPED A MEDICAL TOOL, A DIAGNOSTIC PANEL OF CLINICAL "MARKERS" TO ENABLE HIM TO PREDETERMINE WHICH COVID-19 PATIENTS WOULD NORMALLY REQUIRE RESPIRATOR TREATMENTS AND HE AGGRESSIVELY INTERVENED BY TREATING THEM WITH IMMUNOSUPPRESSANTS TO PREVENT CYTOKINE STORM SYNDROME. AND, HE ALSO GAVE PATIENTS AN ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUG TO CONTROL WIDESPREAD INFLAMMATION. MORE DETAILS ARE AVAILABLE ON THE PROVIDENCE CEDARS-SINAI TARZANA MEDICAL CENTER WEBSITE, OR BY CALLING DR. YADEGAR. </COMMENT 18>

<COMMENT 5> Prof Dave, have you looked at the claims of James Lyons-Weiler PhD? </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> i thot you gonna talk about Bill Gates vaccine , 666 chips, etc. this is the number one most popular HOAX in the world. not just in the US </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Professor Dave, this is a serious question, how do we know we’re safe?
The latest WHO numbers have the known cases to know deaths now below 1% (.6% last I saw) and that should go even lower as more cases are discovered.
When this 1st began and it was at 3%, they speculated it could be below 1%, but just in case, we need to quarantine in case the fatality rate really is 3%.
The CDC numbers have fatalities plummeting the last few weeks, since many places have begun opening back up again(which have included large groups gathering, within 6 feet of each other on beaches, without masks, probably transmitting things not called COVID-19).
So the fall in numbers aren’t correlated to beginning a quarantine.

Every piece of media I see, still seems to be fear mongering.
It’s “a new normal”.
It’s “there could be a 2nd wave”.
It’s “no one can ever gather in groups, within 6 feet of each other, ever again”
It’s “we have to play sporting events without fans” (never mind the large numbers of protesters gathered together)
It’s “we can’t have students attending actual classes or living in dorms”

I’ve even heard major new sources suggest “CDC numbers are too low & fraudulent”
That sounds like conspiratorial thinking?
We may never have a COVID-19 vaccination.
If we have one, there’s always another pandemic around the corner and we’ve always managed in the past to get through it with less knowledge and without destroying our way of life.

At what point do we just go back to not living in fear and isolation?
The “experts” I hear in the media sound like they want everyone to live in fear and isolation for the foreseeable future.
People are losing jobs, and having tons of people in homeless shelters, will probably spread the disease faster than being at work 8 hours a day.

Do we still think millions will die, if people stop the quarantine tomorrow and get back to living life?
I don’t think the data bears that out.

Who will tell us we’re safe?
How will they know?
There is risk to everything, what is the acceptable level, & can someone tell me what exactly that is.
If we thought about the 1.35 million people who die on roads every year, would we want to drive?
I want the legitimate truth, does anyone have a clue? </COMMENT 7>

I found this is two seconds.   Several studies, peer reviewed that show clear and present danger.   Some countries do not allow wifi in schools and it's not because they are uninformed. 

Don't be fooled by this guy, there are A LOT of scientists concerned about the level of radiation we are exposing ourselves to.    Here's a excerpt from Scientific American:

"The World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified RFR as "possibly carcinogenic to humans" in 2011. Last year, a $30 million study conducted by the U.S. National Toxicology Program (NTP) found “clear evidence” that two years of exposure to cell phone RFR increased cancer in male rats and damaged DNA in rats and mice of both sexes. The Ramazzini Institute in Italy replicated the key finding of the NTP using a different carrier frequency and much weaker exposure to cell phone radiation over the life of the rats." 

  And that's just cell phones.  Imagine what a tower pulsing crazy numbers is doing.   I'm not saying it's the cause of Coronoa, not at all,  but there is for sure evidence that it might be harmful.  And this guy is wrong about 5G not being new...it's been around but not networked nationwide, which is what they've been turning on the past couple years.  He sounds like he's reading PR from Verizon's website or something.

Go ahead and click and read the some of the 200 stuidies I linked to and get back to me if you aren't seeing a pattern of potential risk to humans.    This guy just dropped in credibility a lot for me. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> do you have keyboards on the keyboard? </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Conspiracy followers are quite likely to write-off any contradictory evidence, by claiming that the contradictory evidence is part of the conspiracy.  Indeed, people have genuinely written-off all evidence that contradicts the notion that COVID 19 is a conspiracy, by calling that contradictory evidence a conspiracy.  Covering all bases, the conspiracy people have declared COVID 19 to be a conspiracy because it does exist, or a conspiracy because it doesn't exist.  In other words, the virus was created by the Illuminati/NWO/Bill Gates/1984 Big Brother/Chinese/US Government/Spherical Earth scientists, in order to control all of humanity, at the same time as being a hoax by the Illuminati/NWO/Bill Gates/1984 Big Brother/Chinese/US Government/Spherical Earth scientists. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> While I was awaiting your reply I did some research of my own and it turns out my immune system will take care of the virus in a few days just like the thousands of people who had it and survived.. So why exactly should one imprison ones self when  the symptoms are mild and the cure inside us all..hmmm? </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Typhoid Mary had an excuse, these idiots today don't have one, and I mean stupid people who refuse to wear masks to prevent the spread. Asymptomatic individuals who have no symptoms but are carriers. I wear a kiosk respirator to protect me and my elderly parents from these people. The next extinction event will be caused by stupidity not a natural disaster, not to say that stupidity is'nt a natural disaster. It is. Ignorance is excusable, stupidity is not. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Interesting. Take a bunch of insane and stupid conspiracy theories like the viruses don’t exist and 5G nonsense and combine them with the investigation of the origin which raises super legit questions. Is it to discredit the very legitimate argument on the origin? </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> I don’t know about you, but I’m a ginger and I destroyed COVID (probably, I was sick for a while at the start of the Corona craze and I felt like I was going to die.) </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> All but the fourth are insane junk of course. But on the 4th, not buying it. First, people cannot manufacture viruses. Let’s get that out of the way. Nobody is saying that.  What we are saying is that there is very high likelihood that this came form the virology lab in Wuhan (which is run by the PLA by the way). The most innocuous explanation is an accident. Accidental release of a virus they were researching. However, another scenario is they were conducting biological weapons research and experimenting with viruses that can attach to humans easily. Again accidental release. I give that a lower probability and a Nature article makes a plausible and convincing case against it.  But leaves several questions. The spike S protein is perfectly adapted to a human host. In fact, based on other research from Australia, this S glycoprotein binds to humans better than it binds in any other animal host. That part is very odd and such mutation in an intermediate animal host seems hard to believe. On the other hand, developing these mutations while in human hosts means that it had to be circulating for a while in humans (well before November and remember this is a slow mutating virus) but there is no evidence of that. This is very odd. Why I think lab experimentation (creation of Chimera viruses) is at least a plausible explanation. Perhaps a low probability but is plausible. This kind of research is nothing new, the Soviets used to conduct such experiments. At some point they tried to combine the DNA from Venezuelan equine encephalitis, smallpox (super contagious) and Ebola viruses (back in the 80’s). It was called the Chimera Project. The Chinese want to dominate the world and show their scientific excellence. 

Bottomline, don’t listen to what the Chinese say. Pay attention to what they do. The mad cover up and the lies. Why would they go to such extend to cover up if it was from an animal market? Also, if it was truly from the wet animal market why would they open them back up so fast? Makes little sense. </COMMENT 15>

<COMMENT 9> <COVID-19 TRUTH>
*Most people won’t get the virus.*
*Most of the people who get it won’t display symptoms.*
*Most of the people who display symptoms will only be mildly sick.*
*Most of the people with severe symptoms will never be critically ill.*
*And most of the people who get critically ill will survive.*

This is borne out by the numerous serological studies which show, again and again, that the infection fatality ratio is on par with flu.
( https://swprs.org/studies-on-covid-19-lethality/ )
There is no science – and increasingly little rational discussion – to justify the lockdown measures and overall sense of global panic.
Nevertheless, it’s always good to get official acknowledgement of the truth, even if it has to be leaked.
Here are three leaks showing that those in power know that the coronavirus poses no threat, and in no way justifies the lockdown that is going to destroy the livelihoods of so many.
1. “IT’S ALL BULLSHIT!”
On May 26th Dr Alexander Myasnikov, Russia’s head of coronavirus information, gave an interview to former-Presidential candidate Ksenia Sobchak in which he apparently let slip his true feelings.
( https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/05/27/its-all-bullsht-russias-coronavirus-information-chief-says-of-virus-fears-a70398 )
Believing the interview over, and the camera turned off, Myasnikov said:
It’s all bullshit […] It’s all exaggerated. It’s an acute respiratory disease with minimal mortality […] Why has the whole world been destroyed? That I don’t know,”

<COMMENT 11> I don't feel like writing covid 19 tragedy romance is any different than any other tragedy romance subject. I had a faze when I was younger where I only read hospital shojo manga. I'm sure you could criticize the romanticisation of illness, but I think it really depends on how seriously the story wants you to take things. "Is it damaging?" is the question Id ask. Stuff like 13 Reasons Why, is damaging. I guess I just don't personally know where the line is when it comes to fiction because I tend to like tragedy romance stories. It helps me forget my own problems and relate with something much worse so that I don't have to directly think about my problems, while also letting me cling onto the ideal of companionship. </COMMENT 11>

<COMMENT 12> Amazing news </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> PABALA
Panunuhol ay umiiral na ngaun sa mga companies at sa Media para ma isagawa na ang pang kalahatan bakuna.

May dalawang component itong future vaccine na hnd pa tinutukoy secret pa. Pero ang pangatlo ay ang " SQUALENE ".

COVID 19 =means Certificate Of Vaccination Identity with 19, 1=A 9=I for AI= Artificial Intelligence

Hindi pala ito pangalan ng virus, kung hindi itoy International plan para ma control at hnd dumami o lumaki ang population. At na developed na ito mga 10 year o mahigit pa. Na ilunsad na ito last January 2020 during the last DAVOS.
DONT GET TRACK
(wag tau sumunod)
pag katapos ng 70 days, ang virus na ito ay hnd na active, kaya nalalampasan natin ito. Kaya naman nag reactivates ang virus na ito, kasi humina ang immune natin sa bakuna.
Ang plano talaga nila i inject sa atin (7 more terrible vaccines) totoong ibabana o ihuhulog tayo pa puntang impierno.

Ang target nila, madaming mababawas na tao, mahigit 80% ang ma papasama.

Ito naman 5G na na install sa mga cities sa buong mundo, ay para sa ganun humina ang atin immune defense. Kaya wag talaga mag pa test hindi ito segurado o ligtas.

Ang mga manufacturer o gumagawa ng test na ito ay nag sasabi, na hnd ma detect ang SRaS_COV_2 virus na ito. Kung hindi ang walang katapusan na maliliit ma virus o wastes cell lamang na nasa microbiata natin, kaya ang result o lumalabas, madami ang positibo pero hnd nila matukoy ang covid virus mismo.

Kaya ito ang objective nila:
Ang reason ngaun, una ilabas ang mga bata, kasi hnd nila ma impose ang test sa mga matatanda.

Sa kabila nito, last May 11 sa France, nag karoon ng mass screening da lahat ng school(700thousand/per week).
Kaya naman bawat School Director ay may pahintulot galing sa Rectorate para sa ganun  ma impose o ma obliga ang test sa mga bata. Kahit walang pahintulot sa magulang o wala manlang pasabi.

Once na ang bata na screened, saka lang tatawagin ang immediate family para mag pa screened test din. Obligado ka tanggapin ang screening. Kasi kung ayaw mo, an anak mo ay aalisin o tatanggalin sa naturang school. Yan ang mangyayari at itoy ay Order ng School.

Tayo walang sakit, tayo ay healthy carriers, carriers lang tayo sa maliliit o little viruses lamamg yan ang laging lumalabas sa mga test....as positive.
Lahat sila kailangan ganito:
Paniwalain na ang buong mundo. Na ang mundo natin ay may sakit. " MAKE THE WHOLE WORLD BELIEVE THAT THE WORLD IS SICK".

Kapag naging positive sa test ay matutukoy na isa kang panganib, tulad ng mga Hudyo.
Ang pag tanggi sa screening ay siyang susi para mas maiwasan natin ang pag tatalaga ng bakuna sa atin (wave 2), kapag hindi tumaas ang bilang, ay mas hindi sila papayagan na italaga ang bakuna sa 7 bilyon katao....

Sa oras na nabakunahan  labat tayo ay magkakasaki at manghihina.....at alam nyo ma ang kasunod...
Sa France, ang mga tao doon ay tumatanggi sa screening, at ang dahilan, the only messege is maintindihan ito ng buong Social Network and in France is the ff:
_during 9 days we shld only talk about that,
_close your book, videos that deal with secondary subjects.

At ang last messege to get across during those 9 days.
_ huwag sumunod, at wag payagan ang mga bata sumunod na walang pahintulot ng magulang.

Sa France, ang mensahe ay na iintindihan ng mga mamamayan doon, na hnd nila pababalikin ang mga bata sa School. Pagitan ng mga estado, na may mga critical situation. Ayaw nila may mass screened at hnd sila obligado sa second wave to be vaccinated o bakunahan. Ang mahalagang solution, iligtas ang isang katauhan and to make people understand that they should not be tested.
Huwag mag pa test
Huwag ibigay sa kanila kung ano ang wala sila
Huwag kang mahulog sa trap.
Everything will flow from there;
1. Hindi ka mag papahuli
2. Hindi ka mag papa test
3. Hindi ka mag papa bakuna

We must fill the walls of face book, videos, all media spaces with this unique messege.

More clear panels!
Their point of attacks; our children.
Str

Their strategy:
_ a screening
_ do not give what they lack
_ at least you cannot say that you have not been warned

Ipa mahagi ito sa lahat hangat maaari sa lalong madaling panahon, hangat maaari kasi ang proseso nitoy ay parating na.

oh my God Hide us in your pavillion, save us Lord.

<COMMENT 15> Most of us have already been exposed and probably have not just antigens but t cells from previous coronaviruses we've fought off.  Vitamin C, D and zinc and good nutrition will fight off covid.  I know this first hand because I have family at the front line working in health directly with covid patients on a daily basis and they have never caught covid when other colleagues have.  The only difference was my family mega dosed with Vit C, D and zinc.  It works and could have stopped this virus from getting out of hand if only more doctors implemented this as a treatment.  High dose IV vit C was used in China and all people in the trial recovered.  Even those who were declining quickly.  Also they couldn't find a vaccine for Sars 1, the ferrets they used all produced cytokine storms when exposed to the live virus.  Moderna's current human trials have already produced serious effects in the test subjects.  One guy passed out, had a high fever and was vomiting and he was young and healthy.  Now imagine giving that to your elderly grandparents, would be disasterous.  Do your own research.  When Moderna shares spike by 40% with the "promising" results from the trials this far why would the Chief Medical Officer sell off ALL of his shares unless he knows something we don't.  If you had shares in Apple or Facebook and your company went up by 40% overnight, you would sell some and keep some shares, not sell 100% of them.  These are the things we need to look out for.  Find out for yourselves.  Don't just take the vaccine for the sake of it.  Most people are asymptomatic because of the t cells they already have ready to go.  You are the solution to this problem.  Trust your immune systems, they are brilliant and no vaccine can ever replace that. </COMMENT 15>

<COMMENT 5> Sweden did no lockdown and has no problems, see euromomo.eu. Corona viruses are quite harmless and most people who get infected do not even become sick. The lockdown does not help, it only harms people. Send everybody who voted for a lockdown to jail! </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> You just woke up? </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> RTI reply to mask also refers to MOHFW guidelines which says there is no scientific evidence to show health benefit of using mask for non sick people.
And when in Allopathy no proven medicine is there but chances of harmful side effects are very very high why it is to be chosen as the first and the only option without checking and confirming it for sure that there is no cure in Nature or Ayurveda/Homeopathy( I have no idea about Unani) having no side effects but free of cost or very low cost. Is it not prudent and common sense  that these are checked first before going to an option which has a potential to be lethal as a treatment ?? 
Why, while searching honest answer to find a cure, should this question not be asked bold and loud , “Is there any cure for covid in Nature/Ayurveda/Homeopathy”? Why? Is it because the answer to that question will also be a bold and loud YES?? And hence avoid it??
All these three have come up with published treatment to cure covid now. 
Is there any strong evidence then not to believe  that this is a part of an agenda? </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Due to TB 1300 people die every day in India. It is more infectious than covid and more fatal. Every year 15 to 16 lakhs people die in the world  because of Tuberculosis as per WHO inspite of having established BCG( can you guess then how effective it would be , you seem so intelligent)but that does not shake your soul. Never mask was mandatory for TB which also spreads from coughing and sneezing and lock down was never thought of. Have you sold your conscience as you are not bothered to even mention it. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Great risk in wearing mask for the healthy and no benefit for them in wearing it. The guidelines say. </COMMENT 9>

Above is the guidelines of mask by MOHFW. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> You are talking all nonsense . Please listen to your conscience this is fear mongering and akin to rumour. Why did not you give the reference number of the article of Lancet. You seem to appear be more intelligent than you actually are. 2 m distancing is absurd. To say further you are away from a person the less chance you have to get an infection from that person you do not need any Lancet or smart looking shallow journalist’s foolish talk.

<COMMENT 20> When people are having symptons so bad , (this might sound cold,) but, they need to consider signing DNR papers. If they're on ventilators, they aren't breathing on their own. Why prolong things.  Its sad but obvious. The way it is, no one wants to enter hospitals , clinics, nursing homes etc.   These places are filled with diseases, and germs. Now a family member cant even be with a loved one. Or a father witnessing the birth of his children. Our loved ones dont get any moral support. They should be able to suit up like doctors and nurses fron head to toe, so please let at least one family member can sit with their family. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 3> Hello, sir.

Let me introduce myself, I'm Ferry, from Bogor, Indonesia.

Just sharing info. That in Indonesia, our small team, named Milagros, has given milagros water donations to hospitals that treat positive patients.

And the result, just by drinking Milagros water, recovery from covid19, is very perfect.

In our data, it has been noted that Milagros water is able to fight covid19. Also other health problems.

What I'm focusing on is that in Indonesia there is no need for a vaccine. We just take Milagros, corona can be overcome.

Right now, what your country does not have, but in my country is very abundant, is Milagros water.

Which is clearly proven to be able to cure positive patients covid19 to completion.

And it's proven, some of our small teams don't need an anti-covid vaccine. Just drinking milagros, it's resolved.

If you want to know more about Milagros water, you can contact my Whatsapp number at +6285925081694 </COMMENT 3>

<COMMENT 11> “Illnesses range from mild to severe and even death. Hospitalization and death occur mainly among high risk groups. Worldwide, these annual epidemics are estimated to result in about 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness, and about 290 000 to 650 000 respiratory deaths”. This paragraph was taken straight from a WHO site. Anyone reading it might imagine it refers to Covid-19 but no, it refers to the average worldwide annual influenza infections. The figures of up to 5 million infections and 650,000 deaths means a death rate of up to 13% of those infected. As I write this, Covid-19 has infected 5,933,622 people and 362,629 have died, representing a death rate of those infected of approx. 6.1%. So far, the death rate for Covid-19 is approximately half that of influenza.

<COMMENT 1> Covid-19 is like Sharks, they are attracted by Blood, and the covid-19 appetite is FEAR, the more one FEARS the more covid-19 strives, but no one listens because after a while it is like crying WOLF,
Nobody believes who cries Wolf, but then, all of a sudden, people start Dying, the ones that have LOW or NO IMMUNITY! - That is the Population REDUCTION that was talked about when the 4 Pillars or Rules were established by some Secret Free Mason Society to reduce population! That is what the Elites want. Less people to care for Financially. All bunch of Mother Fuckers in Clown Costumes made by some wacko Deranged Taylors! </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Did  update 43 get taken down ? I can't find it </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> This is so helpful. Thank you. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Reinfection is possible because I got it AGAIN!!!! </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> The problem is with mutation. A number of people have gotten the same set of very unique symptoms after long periods of time with none of them, only to get very sick again. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blJVePv_E_E </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> I REALLY NEED TO KNOW if there is a relapse of infection (not reinfection) was is the risk of contaigon? If I've been feeling fine for better for two weeks but still test positive (PCR) should I stay quarantined and self isolate, get retested? In my area I've been told that I'll be fine to go back to work in the food industry after 2weeks without needing to be retested. I don't understand that certainty if I still tested positive 6weeks after onset of symptoms! Am I infectious or not?! </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> self inflicted gunshot to the head......cause of death.....COV19. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> ‪Dr., please consider posting a list of latest best practices for supporting optimal immunity (with disclaimer) at the end of each video? Great work deserves a wider audience. folks will pass simple advice along.‬ </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Are Rh Negatives immune to Covid-19? </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Can you explain what actually happened to those 100 over patients that were retested positive of covid 19, since reinfection is unlikely, could it be reactivation, like the herpes? </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> What about these docs?
https://youtu.be/xfLVxx_lBLU </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Thats the big question tho, is the covid virus mutating. And will it do so yearly like other flu viruses do. As some suggest it will return yearly. I was reading about overseas where those who had it and got rid of it, at a later point got it again. So were left with more questions it seems relating to is it mutating and how fast. Because with a new mutation means the human body must repeat the whole sickness process all over again to develop antibodies against it. One reference to this is at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToI_C7gKjtk </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Are you correct about saying sensitivity and specificity about antibody test? I'm afraid you are confusing those 2 words and actually you are totally misunderstanding each other. Per wikipedia, test sensitivity is the ability of a test to correctly identify those with the disease (true positive rate), whereas test specificity is the ability of the test to correctly identify those without the disease (true negative rate). Right? Or did I confuse what you explained??? </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Thank you for your impressive presentations, dear Doctor. I would like to ask you your opinion about  the meaning of my test IgM “not reactive” and IgG “borderline” (chemoluninescent test CLIA). I did not have any symptoms since 4 weeks at now, and I did have contacts with positive, severe patients.
Moreover: was detection of IgG performed in reinfected monkeys? Kind regards and thank you for you precious job </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Thank you for explaining this in common language. I wouldn't have possibly understood this in a million years, had I read the medical journals/research you cited, myself.

More power to your channel and thank you again. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> With the high level of comments on here. Can an educated person tell me why people are protesting? </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> So you could say after this research that herd immunity is most likely for those that have recovered from the virus and that a gradual removal of government restriction will only result in infection of those that have not been through an infection. 

Slightly off the subject but is there an indication that the seriousness of a case is proportionate to the concentration of the virus? </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> The data being used to generate the lethality rate of coronavirus (with which one can become infected) and COVID-19 (the actual disease which may or may not occur if one actually has the coronavirus) is highly unreliable. First of all, the CDC on their website writes concerning the "sequences" they are relying on to indicate the presence of the coronavirus that "every effort has been made to assure the accuracy of the sequence, but CDC cannot provide ANY WARRANT regarding their accuracy." (emp. mine).

Second, Steven Schwarz, the director of the Division of Vital Statistics, sent out a directive stating that one should report CV-19 as the cause of death if either it DID cause the death OR is ASSUMED to have caused the death. He then adds that if the person ALSO had COPD, asthma, etc., that should be reported IN PART II. (Why just 'Part II') The "assumption" clause introduces a healthy dose of arbitrariness into a stew already brewing with a test that the CDC refuses to endorse.

It gets worse. Dr. Cameron Kyle-Sidell has testified that while running an ICU at Maimonides dedicated exclusively to the WORST cases of CV-19 he has not seen even ONE case where CV-19 is conjoined to pneumonia. Instead, he has seen something like altitude sickness (from people who have been nowhere near a mountain recently!). The upshot: the medical community the whole world over has been told that CV-19 CAUSES pneumonia. Hence, if someone happens to test positive (even falsely, as it may be reasonably inferred, will happen quite often with a test of uncertain accuracy) AND has pneumonia or influenza AND dies . . . well, then that will go down in history as a death caused by CV-19.

Bad test + giving license to subjective assumptions + total misunderstanding of whatever the disease is = throw out the numbers & redo them on the basis of correct information and responsible reporting rules.

 Just in: deaths from pneumonia, heart attack, and stroke are ALL down from Dec. '19 through April, '20. Give yourself one guess why . . .

One more: a Stanford study based on a test for anti-bodies has concluded that in one region in CA, from 50 to 80× more persons have been infected than originally thought. Dr. Bhattacharya said this could lower the lethality of the coronavirus to slightly worse or double (flu: 1/1000, cv19: 1/500-1/999, .02% at worst) that of influenza. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Please explain, why those who do "virology" that the testing give a "false positive" and "false negative".
Please also explain WHY these doctors of having issues with this virus.

<COMMENT 1> These symptoms tips are becoming like a bazaar , everyone is out there . The sensible thing would be to contact your doctor if you have any qualms . There is general neurosis everybody seems to have one or the other of 10 to 14 symptoms . </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> a doctor with the name 'Khan' reminds us of the leader of the Mongols that are today carrying out Genocide in Indonesia and killing my friends..is hard to watch him making not a mention of the Genocide but then he wouldn't just don't care </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Very good synopsis, so much more comprehensive than most videos. Thank you for taking the time to inform. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Who IS this clown?  Could they have picked a WORSE spokesman for symptoms of a virus pandemic?  I mean, I have nothing against his accent, but my god, his delivery and ridiculous attitude are incredibly annoying to watch and listen to. And to add insult to injury, the guy tells the symptoms in REVERSE order of importance so we have to watch his awful delivery until the very end.  Ha! Very funny!!! </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> I got a redeye wich started to develop yesterdey and this evening I got fever, no other symptoms fingers crossed. Hope its not corona. </COMMENT 5>

<COMMENT 10> Hi Sir, I loss my sense of smell and taste,  but Ill ask you later a question.   Because two months already that I'm using iodine and Vicks and put it in my nose before I wear my mask as added protection when I go outside.  And take note. I used two mask also.    And if I'm in my room, I used a diffuser machine .  in the machine, I added an iodine and essential oil, so that I can make my room smell nice and also disinfects by the iodine.    So my question, is over using use of iodine and Vicks, both putting directly my nose and by breathing it might cause an infection to my nose with my frequent use of this two things?   Please reply.

Note: june2 today, 3rd day of loss of Smell and taste. </COMMENT 10>

<COMMENT 12> I've had stomach pain, nausea, dizziness, blurred vision, migraine headache, swelled glands, coughing up mucus, feeling like I can't swallow, muscle and back pain, and no appetite, I am extremely tired.I actually went to the E R they did not test me for the virus, I have not had any fever. I was diagnosed with pharyngitis and sent home. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Maybe in addition to sending out money, the govt should also send out ounces of the very best medical marijuana. That would chill people out AND quell flu symptoms. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Who ya pointing at doc?  haha!  And did you have high blood pressure before you caught it?  https://youtu.be/mzluiL-_eeM </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> I have "air hunger" and dizziness from just wearing the mask all day! And I have a dry cough from my asthma! </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> It's  my  stomach doesn't feel good  I can't tell  that all  and  yes  I do get diarrhea and shortness of breathing too as well </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> I think this virus feel same like patient face dengue fever. Starting high fever that can make organ inside got strong heat make more dihydrate untill bleeding and  if not seeking intention medication you will die. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> I have been feeling a bit unwell but today I woke up feeling dizzy </COMMENT 18>

In this study of adult patients admitted to hospital for severe COVID-19, remdesivir was NOT associated with statistically significant clinical benefits. </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 1> I've been doing yoga 6 days a week two different gyms. 
   In late January early February I had a dry cough and I seem to be getting better and then it hit me really hard. 
  On Monday February 3rd I had to go to my doctor because I was having trouble breathing. In fact I had to sleep in my easy chair for three nights because when I lay flat I was drowning in fluid.
     Doctor said the lungs were clear but I had a sinus infection and gave me a steroid, an antibiotic and a cough suppressant. 
     The whole illness took about six to eight weeks to fully pass. 
      I've recently learned that other people in the yoga class at one of the gyms also got this kind of illness in late January early February and one was admitted to ICU. This is all before Coronavirus was in the news in the United States.
     I thought it was one of the worst flus I've ever had as far as trouble breathing.
   I almost went to the emergency room but I have a $600 copay so I suffered till Monday February 3rd when I could get in to see my doctor.
    Now if only the United States was big enough tall enough and strong enough to have a reliable antibody test I'd be glad to be donating plasma right now. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Doctors in south america are using ibuprofen, steroids and antibiotics in case of fever.   Super effective.    My friend's wife was recovered with steroids.  In fact they are upset about this type of disinformation.  they are not following suggestions given by the WHO. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> thank you doctor  :) </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> It figures because when we give vaccines to babies, we ask parents not to give paracetamol with aspirin. Why? Because it interferes with the antibody reaction which is the REASON for a vaccine. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Dr Seheult, I have recently discovered your channel and am a new fan! I am a nurse practitioner who has completed the integrative medicine program throught the University of Arizona Center for Integrative Medicine.  I was fascinated by our unit on osteopathic manuipulation (low velocity manipulation as opposed to high velocity chiropratic manipulation).  There is a technique we learned that opens the ribcage a few extra centimeters.  We learned this was used in the 1918 influenza pandemic and that those patients had higher survival rates. This fact alway stuck with me.  As you talk about what we can do at home to enhance survival this techinique could be one of those things.  It is simple.  You reach under the back of a supine person from the side with both hands palm up.  Your fingertips find the edge of the spine.  You then push your fingers gently up and draw them back out pulling the ribcage gently outward.  Do this on both sides several times the length of the ribcage.  I wonder if you would consider researching oestopathic interventions for respiratory illness and what we know about this during the 1918 pandemic.  This to me, is in the category of possible help, low risk. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Ibuprofen is not recommended then in normal cases, but what if the patient's antibodies are going into overdrive, wouldn't it be better to reduce the antibody response in these cases using Ibuprofen or a lesser drug?. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> So great...but what should we do if we get symptoms?  Just do nothing?  In regular flu I take Bayer or Nyquil at night...or Alka Seltzer Plus and Afrin nasal spray. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Yeah, let's believe the CCP about the low number of cases in China...because they have been telling the truth since the beginning... </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Just let the zombie apocalypse happen, that would make me happy, i need that adrenaline rush </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Homeopathy can save lives of Covid19 patients </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Btw, about thermal therapy. Im a doctor, a general practitioner. When my daughter got her DPT vaccine shoot, she was 3 m.o, i didnt give her NSAIDS for her fever. Instead, i use a bottle of hot water, wrapped with cloth, just enough to make it not burning but still hot enough. Then every time her temperature rise, there is an inflamation around the spot where she got the injection. It was bulging, red and, hot. So what i did is i place the wrapped bottle over the inflamation while brestfed to shoothe her. And...as the inflamation reduced so does her temperature, not too long, around 10-15 minutes for the fever to resolve. I repeated everytime she started to develop fever. So, i use no NSAID at all and succeded reduce her fever. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> But i guess in acute stage of infections the immune system which play roles is non-specific immunity, which is not involving B cells </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> At this moment, citizens in New York have reported empty hospitals and empty testing centers, showing footage of it, and talking to ambulance drivers who can't say how many COVID-19 cases they've seen that day. Nurses at the reception are the only human beings in the hospital, while CBS reports long lines of people waiting to enter, for testing or treatment. Some amateur reporters are stopped, and told off, but I've seen footage showing empty hospitals, even one German guy walked through an entire hospital in Berlin, showing the empty rooms, hallways, and the reception. No one stopped him! Are we in a make-belief scenario? </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Ibuprofen made me worst, I was thinking it wasn’t strong enough and was popping them like skittles..... the fevers chills headaches body aches felt like I would never feel normal again, night time it was a beast </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Considering that aspirin comes from willow trees, did the doctor discover it or invent it? </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> So what's the bottom line? needs more research? nice. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> My intuition would be to dose with Ibuprofen early on to inhibit replication and control fever and inflammation, 
then when fever has abated, remove the Ibuprofen to not inhibit antibody production.  Will try on myself should 
I contract the virus. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Chinese government lies. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Explained brilliantly. I am also trying to help doctors in their USMLE prep thru medical mnemonics. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> I’m a pharmacist who recently came across your channel. I find it concise, very informative and useful as medical knowledge refresher. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 1> Le virus de la peur, de la bêtise et de la médiocrité continuera à se propager, lui. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> vouloir Contrôler le Peuple en utilisant le COVID 19 est un délit
Contrôler un hêtre humain est illégal
Le Contrôle d'hêtre humain est relatif à l'esclavage, donc c'est illégal

Aucune traite d'humain que ce soit ne doit être toléré
Nous somme dans un état de démocratie, comme le soulignait le PDT de ce pays
et donc, cela implique que le PEUPLE a des droits

Mrs, les dirigeants, vos actions sont contraires aux droits de l'homme
et donc, vous avez enfreins les droits de l'homme, ce qui constitue un délit
votre conscience sera si chargée, que même le pardon du Peuple ne suffira pas vous vos fautes commises </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Ce sont vraiment des bons, ce conseil "scientifique": maintenant que l'épidémie est finie, ils affirment qu'elle est "contrôlée". Le ridicule ne tue plus.....
J'ai même entendu sur TF1 que l'épidémie était sous contrôle grace à la politique de dépistage massif du gouvernement.
Et dire que certains disent que ce sont les complotistes qui sortent des fake news...... </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> omegalul. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Le mytho est bien contrôle ça c'est sur France 24 </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Cette épidémie a fait découvrir que nous avions en France :

- Le Ministre de la Santé
- Le Directeur Général de la Santé
- La Direction de Santé Publique France
- Le Directeur de la Haute Autorité de Santé
- Les Directeurs des Agences Régionales de Santé
- Le Directeur de l’Agence Nationale Sanitaire
- La Direction de l’Alliance Nationale pour les Sciences de la Vie et de la Santé : Epidémiologie-France
- Le Centre National de Recherche Scientifique en Virologie Moléculaire
- L’ Agence Nationale de sécurité du médicament et de la Santé.
- Un nombre d’Infectiologues parisiens incroyablement et anormalement élevés - probablement lié au fait que les Virus et les Bactéries descendent de l’avion à CDG (Aéroport Charles de Gaulle) et ouvrent leur siège social prés de l’Etoile.

Cela ne suffit toujours pas ! Suite à cette épidémie, nos responsables , monstres d’efficacité, de pragmatisme et, comme toujours, soucieux d’économiser les finances publiques vont créer :
- Le Haut Commissariat de lutte contre les Épidémies
- Le Haut Conseil de Veille Sanitaire
- L’ Agence Nationale de Sécurité de Logistique Médicale. Où ça ? A Paris, évidemment !
La prochaine fois, on aura peut être des masques (payants) mais on manquera de gants ! La médecine française croule sous l’administratif centralisé… Et pour la mise en place du déconfinement, on appelle de l'extérieur un Monsieur déconfinement, Jean Castex, ENA, puisque il n’y avait personne de compétent ni de disponible dans l’armée citée précédemment. </COMMENT 6>

Les fameuses autorités sanitaires d’un État des Sans masques , champion du monde des impôts et des taxes , contrôlent mieux une situation après pandémie que les études scientifiques The Lancet dont il semblerait que trois des  Pieds Nickelés de la clique n’aient pas trouvé la posologie du cachet conforme  à leur attente. 
[ Le conseil scientifique ] à hurler de rire , ils ne sont même  pas d’accord entre 
eux .😅😂😹😅😂😹.

Le professeur Raoult a pour  lui un succès international au-delà du peuple français dans sa majorité , le reste ne sont que blablateries d’affairistes corrompus sans honneur , d’une lâcheté sans nom .

<COMMENT 1> Thank you everyone for worrying about demonetization. Thanks to our patrons (high five!) and our sponsors (Go to http://Brilliant.org/SciShow to try out Brilliant’s Daily Challenges. The first 200 subscribers get 20% off an annual Premium subscription.) we don't ever have to worry about whether any individual video is going to get demonetized. Obviously, even if we did, we would still cover topics like this, but it is nice to not have it even enter our minds. Honestly, the subject of whether this video would be monetized literally never came up in the office and that's entirely because of Patreon, so thank you for your support. 

And now I'm gonna go wash my hands now because I just high fived a bunch of people.

<COMMENT 7> I'm usually a big Scishow fan but I must comment.  This video is so wrong about so many things... the western news media was so behind on this.  Asymptomatic carriers aren't an issue?  People in Taiwan, China, S. Korea, knew asymptomatic people could spread the virus in January.  Watching this again in late April is disappointing to see how much people still didn't know about basic facts about this virus in the West.  Why didn't leaders in the West believe officials in Asia or did they just not bother to ask? </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Non issue but thanks for the update.
Can you please do an episode of how ridiculous it is to be going to sure crazy lengths over Covid19 when it has a less than 5% contraction rate and .66% fatality ratio?

<COMMENT 2> hello </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Because kiwis rock oh hell yeah we do🇳🇿🇳🇿🇳🇿🇳🇿🇳🇿🇳🇿🇳🇿🇳🇿🇳🇿🇳🇿🇳🇿🇳🇿 </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Meanwhile in Vietnam : ZERO DEATH </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Tomorrow hopefully is two weeks with no new cases. That means that we can hopefully go back almost normal </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> 1 month later. 12 days without any new cases. Go New Zealand. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> I vote Jacinta as world leader! </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> The Kiwi country knows it's ways. I'm proud of them. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Greetings from New Zealand as of June 1st 2020 we have only had 22 deaths from covid 19 and life in our country is getting back to normal </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> The latest Law just passed by Jacinda Ardern is police can now enter anyone house in New Zealand without a warrant </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Australia has done similarly well without clamping down as hard. And Australia has a much more urbanised population. 

If Americans want to know why their statistics are so bad, they need to ask the New York governor why he forced aged care centres to accept people who were sick with Coronavirus, thus causing a massive toll among the most vulnerable. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Its probably been 2 weeks in NZ where there is no cases </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Wait until the flu season comes and you will know New Zealand never had a strategy </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Living in New Zealand since 2003. And this is why I chose New Zealand over other countries. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> May 30th . Nine days no new cases, but weather or not the PM picked the correct strategy for the long term is yet to be seen. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> It isn't as rosy as people think. Yes, we have eradicated covid 19 , but the shit is about to hit the fan when it comes to our economy. Jacinda is really only good at smiling. Not much else. But I guess it doesn't take much to be a better leader than Trump. Thats just embarrassing. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> They didnt have as many deaths because they dont have as many liberal new networks helping spead the lie to everyone. 
They were not informed about what to say for the scare tactics like other counties. </COMMENT 17>

<DESCRIPTION> NY Gov. Andrew Cuomo updates on a week of violent protests in New York City and on the state's response to COVID 19. https://www.nbcnewyork.com #live ... </DESCRIPTION>
<TAGS> ['live', 'protests', 'cuomo', 'coronavirus'] </TAGS>
<COMMENT 1> This man is contradicting himself more and more everyday. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Get tired to listen this guy.  He just go around and around pointlessly. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Think what helped Epicenter(NYC) is that almost everyone started wearing masks, 99.5 (including me )and social distancing, in streets,stores, no restaurants, takeout only. No congregating except now for these protests. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> New York was able to ramp up their testing to be the test and capital of the world because of President Trump!  That’s the only reason!  In my opinion we’ve all been kept prisoners in our houses for months not being able to work but you allowed protest in the streets for nine days?  And I did not hear you emphasize on a daily basis to these people marching about the selfishness of spreading this disease again and having the whole country shut down just when we might have a chance to carefully restart The process of getting back to work earning a living and actually start living again?????? </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Stay at home and do not work. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Cuomo will cry and ask big brother Trump for help after all protests. He forgets to tell protestors wearing masks. Luckily, not all especially looters they beware of coronavirus. They not only wear masks to cover their faces but also big back bags of medical equipments. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Cuomo should run for president </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> We definitely need national change n reform. We need Leaders that Will uphold existing laws and Our Country and Constitution and Protect Our cities👏👏👏👏 </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Dereliction of duty,violations of oath of office,refuses to stand up for the Police n protect the ppls that's unfortunately stuck in his district😤 Recall Now </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Resign from office    nice tan pal </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Us protesting isn't only about George Floyd its about all the Black and Hispanic people that have been brutalized and killed by police for years til this day, and us fearing when the police show up if we're gonna be man handled & attacked or even killed like they've been doing to us thru out the protest!!
Shame on you governor of NY to say that NYPD was not using violent force on protestor's...Thats a blatant lie we have video footage of alot of incidents of NYPD brutalizing us for the same reason we are protesting!!
We have been suffering from racial inequality in every aspect for decades
Take a look at the Jews for example they have been doing what ever they wanted since they got to the US, when COVID-19 was at the peak the Jewish community was out on the streets in large groups mourning the death of a Rabbi, despite that we were all told this wasn't allowed and NYPD was not brutally attacking them like they've been attacking us while we are peacefully protesting injustice, systemic & general racism!
Its about NYPD & Police Departments all across United States & President/ Government Officials using they're position of power to excerise racist behavior!!

Systematic Racism and Racism in general for decades we have to put an END to for ourselves & future generations!!✊🏾✊🏽✊🏼

Talk About Keeping The Black Race Opressed Educate yourself!!!
Tulsa Race Massacre 
May31-June 1st 1921 in Tulsa Oklahoma!!!! </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Must be nice to have the media play CYA and lie for this incompetent person. He cried I need 40,000 ventilators and then we found out in 2015 he was told to purchase 16,000 and instead wasted almost a billion on a failed solar project. Then he cried I need 2,900 beds in the Javits Center and a ship from Virginia and used about 10% of the capacity. Then we find out he mixed Covid patients with senior citizens and killed almost 10,000 seniors. Then we saw hundreds of homeless sleeping in the subway. 
Now and and DeBlasio have been a disaster with law and order. Cuomo does a great comedy act on CNN with his Brother but otherwise is a disaster and liar and yet the media covers for him. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Thank you, Andrew Cuomo. I appreciate your words and work. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Racism is double edged. Put a white in a black area & he'll get treated like crap & hurt. Seen in upfront yet we cater to & get wrenched by 13% that does more than their unfair share.. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> People's Remenber this  befor. You voto for Democrat hypocrisy 🤸🤸🤸🤸🙄🙄🙄🙄 </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Why doesn’t he show the states that reopened and didn’t spike. And obviously more cases with more testing. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Cuomo is scum. You screwed NYC - you're finished as a politician. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> You mean riots you coward. Support the police. End this trash now. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Data shows the cops ain't doing the job. Mayor Weasel and Gov Gutless are the reasons.  They are failing to use their undercover people to roam the city and report potential trouble brewing. And they are failing to apply the non lethal force necessary to send these deranged children running home. Tear gas, rubber bullets.....night sticks. Rioters and looters know what they're risking. No excuses. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> What kind of vile parents would raise their children to hare law enforcement, hate law and order, and hate America. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 1> Everyone now is paranoid. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> I think World must come out new method to clean our hand nomore with chemical nor alcohol sterra but with pure nature sea salt water see how the c19 reacted...... </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> I think we singapore must change our daily prepair eating pattern no more cold food and beverages but hot soap and gravy food like hot pourage ........ </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> The clips Are edited and do not show the movements in total of the first person " Infected". Results are made to mislead and frighten. In my opinion FAKE </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Propaganda. If your under 80 you have little risk. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> The who head also a big time CHUMP. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Fake news and lies </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Interesting video, What we needed was a part 2 to this video, We needed another set where his hands were washed of as much or all of the paint he had placed on his body then conduct the same study to see if anything shows up then we can see how well using safe practices work. i believe the  first set was to instill fear. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> And this video shows why masks are particularly dangerous to wear. Not only are they harmful to your lungs if worn long periods of time, especially if you have asthma, you can breathe in the virus, which is 120 nm in size THROUGH the holes of an n95 mask, which are 300 nm in size... And you can also breath it OFF the mask that over time gets stained with the virus as you touch it with your hands and you walk through aerosol clouds. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Should be thanking all frontliners and medical health workers for their service. They play a big role to combat this pandemic. Mass testing should really be done as soon as possible.
Does anyone know where can I buy Covid-19 Antibody testing kit? </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Attention Everyone. Whats with the lady from Adelaide who contracted COVID-19 on the Ruby Princess with her husband. He died and she recovered and was given the all clear. Well she has it again and our State Gov is not counting it as a new infection and treating it as an old infection. She apparently has been out and about. This proves it can re-erupt in a recovered person to full blown COVID-19 </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> BS information for dumb people. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> While this a great illustration of how easily fluorescent paint can spread, it leaves out the fact there needs to be enough of the viral particles actually in ones system. If there are not enough of the viral particles, then one won't get the virus. No idea how many viral particles are needed for the flu, the common cold, or for Covid-19. The video is over simplified. And another person pointed out there was more to the study as to if employees served the food, there was little spread. Watching this just underscores to me the importance of frequent hand washing. And probably continuing to go to restaurants that are not self serve. I've never been a big buffet person regardless of germ spreading or not spreading. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Bombshell Study Shows COVID-19 Infection Rates Declining In States That Lifted Lockdowns </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> VICKS KILLS CORONAVIRUS in the air and through inhalation!
Mankind made the same mistake a century ago, trying to eradicate an airborne virus with disinfectants & detergents instead of with eucalyptus oil. Only when they started using Vicks & similar remedies, the  Spanish Flu was finally contained. Simply blow Vicks around from fans & air-conditioners. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Can you guys please repeat the same film over and over again? I didn't see it enough the first 3 times </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Fack coronavirus fack </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> The theory is sound, but the draw back is it is assuming the virus multiplies fast enough they there is enough virus itself to spread that far, wide and heavily. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Sperm everywhere </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> All this useful information from the TV show that did a test segment shooting a cannon in the direction of a housing tract in Danville, CA.

<COMMENT 13> Once China has the vaccine, US will say China had it long ago and not sharing it but spread covid-19 to the world inorder to profit from it. </COMMENT 13>

<COMMENT 15> Space and new physical properties of perhaps single phase RNA inhibitor to reduce it's protein . Sure maybe it's true about the phosphates , also the bad blood about wolfs declaration in space co operation laws, best interpreted by China itself and whatever natural laws which can be observed and sequence tamed by any method. Prototype proto's of course may fail like herd trace or transmission measures. Probably science fiction like bad anti communist's needing a neutral behaviour modifier in the Hong Kong provinces too. It will be legendary many people can't understand and want to blame it on something like nationality. </COMMENT 15>

<COMMENT 5> Should also mention how COVID-19 is the dangerous but low infectivity SARS bird flu + the coronavirus Spike protein adding high infecitivty + 4 insertions of HIV proteins in the spike protein enabling it to counter the immune system, and how such a thing could never happen by itself in nature. https://jameslyonsweiler.com/2020/03/16/sars-cov-2-origins-ipak-research-exonerates-dr-shi/ </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Thanks Clara <3 </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> ALL gross misinformation! Many, many covid-19 positive have NO upper respiratory symptoms at all!  Statistics are not standardized and give high false  positives and death rates. New York just added 3,400 deaths to covid  WITHOUT TESTING!. Ventilators are now being shown to cause death rather than recovery. Most of the medical "experts: including fearmonger-in-chief Fauci have no idea what they are dealing with.  I'd say educate yourselves people but there is, at this point, NO reliable, proven information out there. One "expert" contradicts the other.  Believe what they are saying  at your peril. </COMMENT 7>

<COMMENT 2> I am not a medical nor a biomedical science professional. But, thanks to MedCram and the amazing Dr Seheult I learned so much more and that promoted me to collect my thoughts in a paper summarizing what I learned from the videos and all the research papers referenced. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> I am sharing your videos.  I have relatives in Adelanto and Apple Valley CA I think it might be near San Bernardino because they have mentioned this area. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> A study involving Covid19 patients with Von Willebrand Disease might support that hypothesis.
Great video! Thanks. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> I have read studies on the affect of N-acetyl cysteine in relationship to pulmonary hypertension. The studies have contradicted themselves, with some showing (in rats) that it increases PH, while in others it is suggested that NAC may be a treatment for PH.

I am currently supplementing with NAC and have hypertension. I started on this supplementation after viewing your videos on COVID 19. 

Could you please clarify this NAC PH connection? Perhaps you can address this in one of your videos. 

Thank you very much. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Yes yes, 8 people on ventilators. It's 11-13 patients like these here in my ICU. Getting a bit "sick" from all this pandemic. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Shots for the sheeple </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> ...so... heparin drip or enoxaparin 40mg qd it is then? </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> You're being a little loosey goosey by stating that your hypothesis is validated by these results. Please keep in mind that your mostly layman followers are looking to you for information. There is even a little hero worship evident in some their posts. This behooves you the be stringent in your use of terminology. Otherwise, I enjoy your offerings. You offer another valuable information stream about this important subject. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> I love these videos.  Thank you.  In one of your other videos, mention was made regarding oxygen being a key factor in assisting recovery from Covid.  In this video mention was made of not using ventilation until patients have difficulty breathing it on their own.  Why not put the Covid patients on ventilation treatments immediately to evaluate whether patients have quicker recovery time?  This would ensure they are getting precise oxygen amounts as soon as Covid-19 is detected. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> The notion that exposure to the 'other four' human coronaviruses which cause colds can cross-protect against SARS-Cov2 might explain the paradox of smokers having better COVID-19 survival: Since its well-documented that smokers experience more episodes of  bronchitis and pneumonia than non-smokers, it would follow that they have more exposure to common viruses including coronaviruses, and hence, harbor more antibodies that are cross-protective. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> in fact, the flu in 1969 has caused the same type of blood clots - https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/s-0028-1108874
...and thrombosis in covid-19 is already known for months... Journalists should do some more serious research rather than spreading panic and fear. In 1969 blood thinner could dramatically reduce mortality of infected persons </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> This video was disapproved by 83 people who were hoping to see Bevis and Butthead talking. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> This likely means a covid vaccine would provide protection against some of the common cold coronaviruses....the problem is big pharma would not like that.... </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Wow,  so they finally acknowledge people may have some partial immunity from being infected by one of the 4 common cold coronavirus....
Doesn't take a einstein to figure that out....now they need to see if they people who had activated t-cells have kids under 12 who constantly get sick with virus after virus and bring them home.  I cant count the times I got sick from my kids bringing something home from school or day care. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Quercetin and alkaline water?????????
Doc. I urge you to please take a look into this, in regards to supplemental research. Please make a short video on this topic if it's of any importance. Thanks
-future doctor Brudnicki-Tennessee </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Great research which doesn't appear in mainstream media in my country. I don't know if i understood it right but probably covid 19 gives a long lasting immunity. And some  people not infected with covid 19 have T-Cells recognizing Sars-Cov2 cause some of it proteins are similar to other coronaviruses. If that's the fact does it mean that we need a lower percentage of people infected with Sars-Cov2 for the pandemic to burn itself out casue some people will never become because of the proteins triggered by other cov infections. My conclusion (may be wrong) is that pandemic is gonna end sooner until the vaccine is ready and we will not need the vaccine already. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Is that mean if we infect people with other coronavirus which is not lethal or consequences are common cold might help to educate T cell which helps our immune system to fight back Sars-Cov-2 in more profound way? </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> To take the time to break down a complicated subject and make it understandable to the layman like me is a tribute to a great educator, amazing patience, a great doctor. Thank you doc, youre an amazing credit to your proffesion . </COMMENT 19>

They can make another deadly virus in the name of vaccine </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Why china taking so much time for vaccine...as they Created CORONA ...It might be easy for china to create as they know everything about bio weapon Corona </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> China always make fake and copy. What about the vaccine </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Once China has the vaccine, US will say China had it long ago and not sharing it but spread covid-19 to the world inorder to profit from it. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Some random guy :China stole our vaccine! </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Space and new physical properties of perhaps single phase RNA inhibitor to reduce it's protein . Sure maybe it's true about the phosphates , also the bad blood about wolfs declaration in space co operation laws, best interpreted by China itself and whatever natural laws which can be observed and sequence tamed by any method. Prototype proto's of course may fail like herd trace or transmission measures. Probably science fiction like bad anti communist's needing a neutral behaviour modifier in the Hong Kong provinces too. It will be legendary many people can't understand and want to blame it on something like nationality. </COMMENT 15>

<COMMENT 8> The Kiwi country knows it's ways. I'm proud of them. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Greetings from New Zealand as of June 1st 2020 we have only had 22 deaths from covid 19 and life in our country is getting back to normal </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> The latest Law just passed by Jacinda Ardern is police can now enter anyone house in New Zealand without a warrant </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Australia has done similarly well without clamping down as hard. And Australia has a much more urbanised population. 

If Americans want to know why their statistics are so bad, they need to ask the New York governor why he forced aged care centres to accept people who were sick with Coronavirus, thus causing a massive toll among the most vulnerable. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Its probably been 2 weeks in NZ where there is no cases </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Wait until the flu season comes and you will know New Zealand never had a strategy </COMMENT 13>

<COMMENT 15> May 30th . Nine days no new cases, but weather or not the PM picked the correct strategy for the long term is yet to be seen. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> It isn't as rosy as people think. Yes, we have eradicated covid 19 , but the shit is about to hit the fan when it comes to our economy. Jacinda is really only good at smiling. Not much else. But I guess it doesn't take much to be a better leader than Trump. Thats just embarrassing. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> They didnt have as many deaths because they dont have as many liberal new networks helping spead the lie to everyone.

<COMMENT 2> I am not a medical nor a biomedical science professional. But, thanks to MedCram and the amazing Dr Seheult I learned so much more and that promoted me to collect my thoughts in a paper summarizing what I learned from the videos and all the research papers referenced. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> I am sharing your videos.  I have relatives in Adelanto and Apple Valley CA I think it might be near San Bernardino because they have mentioned this area. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> A study involving Covid19 patients with Von Willebrand Disease might support that hypothesis.
Great video! Thanks. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> I have read studies on the affect of N-acetyl cysteine in relationship to pulmonary hypertension. The studies have contradicted themselves, with some showing (in rats) that it increases PH, while in others it is suggested that NAC may be a treatment for PH.

I am currently supplementing with NAC and have hypertension. I started on this supplementation after viewing your videos on COVID 19. 

Could you please clarify this NAC PH connection? Perhaps you can address this in one of your videos. 

Thank you very much. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Yes yes, 8 people on ventilators. It's 11-13 patients like these here in my ICU. Getting a bit "sick" from all this pandemic. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Shots for the sheeple </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> ...so... heparin drip or enoxaparin 40mg qd it is then? </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> You're being a little loosey goosey by stating that your hypothesis is validated by these results. Please keep in mind that your mostly layman followers are looking to you for information. There is even a little hero worship evident in some their posts. This behooves you the be stringent in your use of terminology. Otherwise, I enjoy your offerings. You offer another valuable information stream about this important subject. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> I love these videos.  Thank you.  In one of your other videos, mention was made regarding oxygen being a key factor in assisting recovery from Covid.  In this video mention was made of not using ventilation until patients have difficulty breathing it on their own.  Why not put the Covid patients on ventilation treatments immediately to evaluate whether patients have quicker recovery time?  This would ensure they are getting precise oxygen amounts as soon as Covid-19 is detected. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> The notion that exposure to the 'other four' human coronaviruses which cause colds can cross-protect against SARS-Cov2 might explain the paradox of smokers having better COVID-19 survival: Since its well-documented that smokers experience more episodes of  bronchitis and pneumonia than non-smokers, it would follow that they have more exposure to common viruses including coronaviruses, and hence, harbor more antibodies that are cross-protective. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> in fact, the flu in 1969 has caused the same type of blood clots - https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/s-0028-1108874
...and thrombosis in covid-19 is already known for months... Journalists should do some more serious research rather than spreading panic and fear. In 1969 blood thinner could dramatically reduce mortality of infected persons </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> This video was disapproved by 83 people who were hoping to see Bevis and Butthead talking. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> This likely means a covid vaccine would provide protection against some of the common cold coronaviruses....the problem is big pharma would not like that.... </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Wow,  so they finally acknowledge people may have some partial immunity from being infected by one of the 4 common cold coronavirus....
Doesn't take a einstein to figure that out....now they need to see if they people who had activated t-cells have kids under 12 who constantly get sick with virus after virus and bring them home.  I cant count the times I got sick from my kids bringing something home from school or day care. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Quercetin and alkaline water?????????
Doc. I urge you to please take a look into this, in regards to supplemental research. Please make a short video on this topic if it's of any importance. Thanks
-future doctor Brudnicki-Tennessee </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Great research which doesn't appear in mainstream media in my country. I don't know if i understood it right but probably covid 19 gives a long lasting immunity. And some  people not infected with covid 19 have T-Cells recognizing Sars-Cov2 cause some of it proteins are similar to other coronaviruses. If that's the fact does it mean that we need a lower percentage of people infected with Sars-Cov2 for the pandemic to burn itself out casue some people will never become because of the proteins triggered by other cov infections. My conclusion (may be wrong) is that pandemic is gonna end sooner until the vaccine is ready and we will not need the vaccine already. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Is that mean if we infect people with other coronavirus which is not lethal or consequences are common cold might help to educate T cell which helps our immune system to fight back Sars-Cov-2 in more profound way? </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> To take the time to break down a complicated subject and make it understandable to the layman like me is a tribute to a great educator, amazing patience, a great doctor. Thank you doc, youre an amazing credit to your proffesion . </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 1> Is it true that there will be a 2nd wave of this virus next winter? Can this thing mutate like the Flu? </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> whos here from science class??? </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Excellent.  Thank you for explaining that!  I can't wait to make my teenage son watch it, too! </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> They havent even isolated the virus yet , but they have a reliable test  for it ? Ugh ,  yeah..... </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Should also mention how COVID-19 is the dangerous but low infectivity SARS bird flu + the coronavirus Spike protein adding high infecitivty + 4 insertions of HIV proteins in the spike protein enabling it to counter the immune system, and how such a thing could never happen by itself in nature. https://jameslyonsweiler.com/2020/03/16/sars-cov-2-origins-ipak-research-exonerates-dr-shi/ </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Thanks Clara <3 </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> ALL gross misinformation! Many, many covid-19 positive have NO upper respiratory symptoms at all!  Statistics are not standardized and give high false  positives and death rates. New York just added 3,400 deaths to covid  WITHOUT TESTING!. Ventilators are now being shown to cause death rather than recovery. Most of the medical "experts: including fearmonger-in-chief Fauci have no idea what they are dealing with.  I'd say educate yourselves people but there is, at this point, NO reliable, proven information out there. One "expert" contradicts the other.  Believe what they are saying  at your peril. </COMMENT 7>

<COMMENT 13> Thanks. A simple explanation from a reliable source. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Interesting, but is it practical in a busy and high-pressured world we live in today? </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Well done! Very accessible...some cell biology, virology, and a bit more. Its well worth a look to understand what we are facing...and of course, more motivation to stay the--social distancing--course. Thank you Clara Liao and Yale School of Medicine! </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> https://www.gofundme.com/f/covid19-masks-for-sardinia-italy </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Please review this study: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354220302011.  Ivermectin is an FDA approved anti parasitic drug available worldwide, and has shown to eliminate 99% of Covid 19 in vitro within 48hrs.  Very promising. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Thank you for this! I am curious about the 24 hour survival time on the virus on surfaces you claimed though. I have read it can survive for several days on some surfaces. </COMMENT 18>

<COMMENT 1> Everyone now is paranoid. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> I think World must come out new method to clean our hand nomore with chemical nor alcohol sterra but with pure nature sea salt water see how the c19 reacted...... </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> I think we singapore must change our daily prepair eating pattern no more cold food and beverages but hot soap and gravy food like hot pourage ........ </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> The clips Are edited and do not show the movements in total of the first person " Infected". Results are made to mislead and frighten. In my opinion FAKE </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Propaganda. If your under 80 you have little risk. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> The who head also a big time CHUMP. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Fake news and lies </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Interesting video, What we needed was a part 2 to this video, We needed another set where his hands were washed of as much or all of the paint he had placed on his body then conduct the same study to see if anything shows up then we can see how well using safe practices work. i believe the  first set was to instill fear. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> And this video shows why masks are particularly dangerous to wear. Not only are they harmful to your lungs if worn long periods of time, especially if you have asthma, you can breathe in the virus, which is 120 nm in size THROUGH the holes of an n95 mask, which are 300 nm in size... And you can also breath it OFF the mask that over time gets stained with the virus as you touch it with your hands and you walk through aerosol clouds. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Should be thanking all frontliners and medical health workers for their service. They play a big role to combat this pandemic. Mass testing should really be done as soon as possible.
Does anyone know where can I buy Covid-19 Antibody testing kit? </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Attention Everyone. Whats with the lady from Adelaide who contracted COVID-19 on the Ruby Princess with her husband. He died and she recovered and was given the all clear. Well she has it again and our State Gov is not counting it as a new infection and treating it as an old infection. She apparently has been out and about. This proves it can re-erupt in a recovered person to full blown COVID-19 </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> BS information for dumb people. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> While this a great illustration of how easily fluorescent paint can spread, it leaves out the fact there needs to be enough of the viral particles actually in ones system. If there are not enough of the viral particles, then one won't get the virus. No idea how many viral particles are needed for the flu, the common cold, or for Covid-19. The video is over simplified. And another person pointed out there was more to the study as to if employees served the food, there was little spread. Watching this just underscores to me the importance of frequent hand washing. And probably continuing to go to restaurants that are not self serve. I've never been a big buffet person regardless of germ spreading or not spreading. </COMMENT 13>

Mankind made the same mistake a century ago, trying to eradicate an airborne virus with disinfectants & detergents instead of with eucalyptus oil. Only when they started using Vicks & similar remedies, the  Spanish Flu was finally contained. Simply blow Vicks around from fans & air-conditioners. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Can you guys please repeat the same film over and over again? I didn't see it enough the first 3 times </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Fack coronavirus fack </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> The theory is sound, but the draw back is it is assuming the virus multiplies fast enough they there is enough virus itself to spread that far, wide and heavily. </COMMENT 18>

<COMMENT 5> Trump's cult is entirely responsible for the demise of your nation. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> I am thankful we dont have fox news over here in NZ. Why do they not give the exact same criticism to Trump administration as they were at Obama's administration. They obviously cant see how inept he is, but be nice for these anchors to get a big fat bonus at the end of the year. </COMMENT 6>

<COMMENT 2> การเปิดเรียนไม่เห็นต้องเปิดพร้อมกันเลย ค่อยๆทะยอยเปิดแต่ละระดับชั้นห่างกัน 15 วัน ก็น่าจะทำได้ ในระดับมัธยมและมหาวิทยาลัย สามารถเรียนออนไลน์ได้แน่นอน เพราะเด็กทุกคนมีมือถือ ระดับประถมต้น และประถมปลายเรียนในโรงเรียน ส่วนอนุบาลให้เปิดหลังเปิดเรียนระดับประถมต้นและปลายห่างไปอีก 15 วัน เพื่อเคลียร์ความปลอดภัยในโรงเรียนก่อนเด็กเล็กจะมา น่าจะเป็นสิ่งที่ทำได้ ดีกว่า ที่จะเปิดพร้อมกัน นักเรียนเต็มโรงเรียนทีเดียว การรักษาระยะห่างน่ะทำไม่ได้หรอกค่ะ อย่ามาหลอกตัวเองกันเลย เพราะเด็กแต่ละห้องมี 30 - 50 คน จะหาพื้นที่ความห่างจากตรงไหนคะ? และบุคลากรในโรงเรียนน่ะมีเพียงไม่เกิน 15 - 20 % ของจำนวนเด็ก จะมีคนมาดูแลจับตาเด็กได้ตลอดเวลาหรือ? </COMMENT 2>

<COMMENT 5> ศูนย์เด็กเล็กนี่อย่าเพิ่งเปิดเรียนก่อนดีกว่าไหมคะ? เพราะเด็กจะยังช่วยตัวเองไม่ค่อยได้ เด็กไม่สามารถรักษาระยะห่างได้แน่นอน และแต่ละห้องก็มีพี่เลี้ยงเพียงห้องละ 1 คนเท่านั้น จะดูแลเด็กได้เหมือนที่โฆษณาเป็นไปไม่ได้เลย หรือให้โอกาสว่า ถ้าบ้านใดมีความสามารถในการดูแลเด็กได้ก็ดูแลไปก่อน อย่าเพิ่งมาศูนย์ฯ แล้วเปิดจริงๆในเดือนสิงหาคม จะปลอดภัยกว่าแน่นอน ลูกหลานก็เหมือนแก้วตา ดวงใจของพ่อแม่แต่ละคน หากเด็กเป็นอะไรไป รัฐบาล กระทรวงศึกษาธิการ และกระทรวงพัฒนาสังคมและความมั่นคงฯจะลุกขึ้นมารับผิดชอบไหมคะ? </COMMENT 5>

<COMMENT 1> Ive been through the icu delirium I went through months, I thought they were trying to kill me, I remember too much of it, I wished I had died.God bless everyone and please talk to someone it helps </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> This is one of many reasons why people are supposed to have relatives and friends with them </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> These people with the 'virus' have immune systems that are severely compromised by living in the modern world with bad air, bad water, bad food and prescription drugs! ! </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Yea its sounds like there experience is tell them they going to hell because of sin if they repent and give there life to jesus i bet there experience would have been different </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> THIS NEEDS TO BE PART OF THE FAMILY PLAN OF COVID. THAT IT CAN HAPPEN AND LIKELY WILL IF YOURE PUT ON A VENTALATOR. 
  If one is tested positive snd wont leave the hospital for weeks, families need to talk about that before it happens, ADVANCED DIRECTIVES!! very important right now as no family proxy will be present. 
 We don’t know all but we know enough as yet to prepare for the worst and hope for the best. 
  Don’t even wish covid on enemies, karma may strike you at home. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> This is spiritual.  We ALL need Jesus,  you are never alone with Jesus!! There is no darkness in Jesus,  He is light.  My prayers will include praying for these people, specifically.  This sounds like prison, this hopelessness doesn't have to be. 🙏 </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> THIS SO FRIGHTENING WHAT PEOPLE ARE GONE THROUGH REALLY SCARY VIVID MEMORIES MORE SCARIER I FEEL SO BAD FOR THEM </COMMENT 7>

<COMMENT 10> You mean "Unit Psychosis"?

On the average it's approximately 0.5%-1.5% of patients that get confused in the ICU etc. That is if they aren't Obtunded.

ARDS is my Job. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Stories like these make me so fortunate to have my mother (age 96) pass from covid 19 with none of the toxic psychosis that manifests as a drug induced ICU delirium coma. She was not in the ICU, just an isolated room in a care unit, and was allowed to die a natural death. I am comforted that she went very peacefully. She would claim to "see" her brother Bob who had been dead for 18 years. I interpret this as stepping into the afterlife, and then stepping back. Eventually, she spent more and more time in the afterlife, until it was final. RIP mom, I wish you didn't have to go, but am grateful you didn't suffer. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Wonder if the mind altering unhappy state is because this might be a manufactured virus.
Were these people religious? Reason I ask such a strange question is because of a recent video I saw where someone suggested they had isolated a specific gene related to religiosity!!! And a virus could me made to alter that!!! religion" gene??? Scary stuff...
https://youtu.be/oWkyRMT9qqQ
Am not a conspiracy theorist...just trying to fit all the pieces of the puzzle together to find the truth.
Hope more people start reporting details instead of the same old stuff.
This is the first ever sensible and and informative piece of news I have seen of COVID-19.  Thank you. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Torturous procedures, and you call it health care. An avalanche of ineptitude called modern medicine. All the well paid professional toadies 'just following orders' in a place where cruelty & ignorance have joined forces against better judgement & compassion or anything close to a talent for healing. No responsibility at all for the evil being performed mindlessly in exchange for a paycheck. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Is there any other way without sedated someone to survive? This is crazy af </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> My ex-husband had an episode of ICU delirium after a motorcycle accident. Hospital staff told me what it was, but offered little other information or support. I went home thinking he could stay in this state indefinitely. People are right: there needs to be psychological support for both patients and those close to them. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> The induced comas sent them to places similar to hell. Things depicted in the book of Dante's. Not trying to make this religious but do you think there were msgs from their dives to the otherside? </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> my aunt and her family got infected but for some reason it got her the harderst despite her being in her early 30s and had no prior illness. she described how the pain was so bad and was suffocating from inflamed lungs that she was really saying goodbye to my uncle and cousin and wanted to die. luckily she recovered after weeks in the ER. the virus is no joke. i don’t really know how people get infected or how often it really happens but it’s crazy for people are going out unprotected like if it doesn’t exist anymore. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Oh my goodness. These people are going to need a lot of emotional support and mental health care now. Please keep talking about it. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Talking about it isn't enough, we need action!  This is really scary!  I've been worried about the COVID-19 survivors because no one is talking about this! </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> So these people may survive the viruis but may end up not living ir even killing themselves? 

I think in a few years we as a society are going to be asking some very tough questions . </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 1> The Pandemic ended when the Media said so </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> The Radical Left are behaving in an anti life manor as per usual.. *when they are not hurting others ,they are hurting themselves.* </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Shameless media - how could one compare continued lifetimes of systematic & institutionalized racism against African Americans with three weeks of being infected. Go out there and distribute face masks to those fighting for the  basic right to live & civil liberties. Don’t shift the blame for the high infections in America.
. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> The best way to show that you care about human life is by not endangering human life. Let’s say a thousand people were exposed to Covid -19 because of all the protest across the country, those thousand people will infect another two thousand people and so on. Since African Americans die of Covid-19 at much higher rates then other ethnicities then thousands of African Americans will die of exposure to Covid -19 as a result of the protest. How do you prove the value of one black life taken by police brutality by inadvertently killing thousands of other black life’s ? It’s the craziest double standard I have witnessed in a long time. The state government closes down thousands and thousands of businesses and demands people to stay at home except for buying essentials and emergencies. Demands that no people can congregate in groups. Yet suddenly it’s ok for hundreds of thousands of protesters to group tightly together all across the nation in protest. I’m all against police brutality and the way they caused the death of George Floyd but you have to be consistent or you have no credibility. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> CDC is issuing guidelines stipulating no more than TWENTY looters are to be allowed in a store at once. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Protesters need to utilize their "rights". Covid-19 is not a right to them. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Don't worry ya'll be joining George Floyd soon since you love him so much. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Mmmmm... Double Bubble. Makes me want some bubble gum... 😆 </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Hahah you have a 15 day window ..he didn't get it from the March lol..if anything he infected others </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> I am gonna say, that. 2020 history books in the future is gonna be very thick. From coronavirus to Kobe Bryant and Gianna Bryant's death. Ahmaud Arbery, George Floyd, Hong Kong protest. I simply cannot believe that we humans, treat colored differently. Black lives matter. We need mercy, we need to be blessed. #BLACKLIVESMATTER #SAVETHEWORLD #WEAREALLTHESAME </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> The protest makes you forget about the virus, till the virus makes you forget about the protests. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> COVID-19 is over there on to a new conspiracy  to destroy economy and Trump </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> People looting were definitely going to die one way or other 😂 </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Was there talk of concern that the thousands of anti lock down protesters trying to "liberate" the states could cause a spike in cases from these journalists? I'm not trying to be funny or anything I genuinely want to know, you know for the sake of balance </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> WASH HANDS MASK UP NOT WORKING ! WHATS WORKING NOW IS MAD UP ANGER UP !!!!!! THINK ABOUT IT !!!!!  🤔MERCY MERCY🤔 </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> If you want to be safe from Covid-19, you might wanna watch this.

<COMMENT 17> excuse so people stop going out to protest </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> So when people were having rallies with missions to end the stay at home order and go back to work, this wasnt a problem? </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> The original outbreak was blown out of proportion simply to create fear. Now riots. The globalists are simply evil pushing their age nda 2  1. Look it up. It's real and it's happening right now. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> There was a guy in Lancaster PA who knew he tested positive for the V but he was out there without a mask and yelling in the cops faces. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 3> If the numbers are correct I don't believe they  are You are following the incorrect data   Everyone   Has  Corona  Virus in their  Body And the tests has a positive and negative results false negatives </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> 47 percent of African Americans are O positive as opposed to 33 percent of whites. So 24 percent of African Americans are A positive. Factor that. Data shmater. I don't believe their data. Do your research. It was out and out neglect because of race but you'd be afraid to say it. If this von milliebrand factor were true, how do you explain the low rate of Covid in Africa? You are just going with the narrative but never mentioned that O blood type is the predominant blood type among BLACKS. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> This was the best info doc.   You connected all the dots! </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> I wish someone would do a study on the RH factor like negative blood?? I heard that negative blood fight off viruses better! I heard that a negative blood can’t get aids? And the only survivors during the Black Plague hundreds of years ago was RH negative blood type?? Could you do some research on this topic I’m very interested in knowing thank you I just found your channel and subscribed 👍👍👍 god bless ya </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Thanks Doc.  This was very informative </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Does the black community have a higher instance of type a blood? Or is there no correlation there? </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> So, is the reason why people with blood type A may get the worst cases of Covid-19 is because of Thrombosis? </COMMENT 9>

<COMMENT 17> Does the RH factor in the A blood group have any bearing or are the A and A - cells intrinsically the same when it comes to this virus ? </COMMENT 17>

<COMMENT 8> I'll depend on my own body to defend itself without injecting foreign things directly into my bloodstream... bypassing all of the body's natural defences. I've managed to stay alive and healthy for almost 70 years with this philosophy. I'd rather be infected with the virus than get vaccinated. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Is intubation the same as incubation ? </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Excellent video as always.  I am an RN and I work in a hospital in the south.  We are just beginning to see covid 19 patients.  We are tracking and managing our ppe very carefully.  But we had staff do a hand hygiene tracker.  They found our hand washing rate to be around 30% which is appalling.  Everyone is just relying on the hand sanitizer outside every room.  Its better than nothing,  but if you are taking off a pair of gloves,  you should be washing your hands.  I think the virus is going to cause us all to be more serious about hand washing. </COMMENT 10>

<COMMENT 19> Could you explain the statistics in real numbers? For example 1% sounds small but could equate to 100,000 people - which is ALOT. Thanks. Good job, by the way. Thank you. </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 1> Even cov 19 it self got bored hearing and waitting for this alleged vaccine news . </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Theres no need for vaccines. Better do Ozone Therapy as prevention and do not beliefe the lies spread by wiki or so, cause they are all puppets of big pharma.

Take a look at RobertRowenMD, watch ALL Videos there, and You will know the TRUTH </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> hablas español? </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Monkey experiments are of essential importance. Because you can't use virus to challenge the vaccinated people, it's better to do it on monkeys first. Now none of the vaccine candidates shows promising results on this aspect. 
Antibodies in your system help you to response to virus quicker. No result shows that if you are infected once, you are immune to COVID19 </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Keep up your working, we are so proud of your all people science. The world hope for all science to save the world and with jesus christ the son of God. Amen </COMMENT 5>

<COMMENT 8> The comments on here make it sound like the vaccine is being developed by angels. They're in a race to develop a vaccine to make money €£€£€£€£€£€£€£€£. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Good deed to help will never be unnoticed,,, God Bless you all </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> We CAN’T CURE AIDS, or even the common cold (another Coronavirus), and yet, we’re all eagerly waiting for a CCP VIRUS vaccine that may never come. My money is on ANTIBODY treatments, especially since sick patients may not have the time to benefit from a vaccine stimulating an immune response before the patient dies. Antibody injection SKIPS the “immune response” latency period.
Oh, and I have ZERO CONFIDENCE in the WHO, also known as CHINA’S LAPDOG, to be looking out for the “best interests of the world” at this point. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> I heard that "Haste makes Waste." So rushing to create a vaccine to a virus that isn't even naturally viral to humans is retarded and a waste of our current finances. </COMMENT 11>

<COMMENT 1> This video is super weak. Did you start mailing it in after the 3 millionth subscriber, or the 4 millionth? </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> How about making a minute of the earth on lucid dreams?  I think it will be very cool the subject is interesting </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Thanks! This was super informational </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Presuming you are getting accurate data from other countries. I expect the number of cases in China is at least one magnitude higher. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> @minutephysics, I'm afraid you have a SERIOUS error here. What you are plotting is log(dy/dt) vs. log(y), so a straight line means log(dy/dt) = k*log(y), or dy/dt = y^k. 
Thus, y = exp(integral of y^(k-1)*t). Since k < 1, this is an exponential only in form because as y grows the y^(k-1) term shrinks. If k = 0.5, then by the time there are a million cases, that term is 10^-5 of the value it started out with, assuming that k stayed constant. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> America doesn't seem at all interested in containing this epidemic, especially now with the riots happening. </COMMENT 6>

<COMMENT 9> Make a video answering this question:
Is AI smarter than us? </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> The Philippines is handling this horribly. We don't even know how our curve looks because the government won't conduct mass testing as adequate levels. And we're relaxing quarantine measures (after THREE MONTHS) before we've even seen any evidence that the curve is flattening. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Roses are red violets are blue why does the Karen think covid-19 is just the ordinary flu </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Can you revisit with current data and talk about why so many countries demonstrate exponential decay, but not USA?  I also tried looking at new cases as ppm and displayed not as absolute numbers but rate of change. There appears to be a period "bump" approximately every 7 days.  Is this real or a result of how data is collected? </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> How's india doing ?Plz reply </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Lately, Republicans have been using the Total Cases statistic to argue that blue states have a worse response to this pandemic than red states.
This video beautifully explains why changes in New Cases is the most relevant statistic if we want to talk about a given government's response to this pandemic. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Two months later, and I'm still checking this graph on a daily basis. I've noticed that rather than a flat or smooth curve, my state's version of "leveling out" is a series of dips where the weekly infection rate is between 500 to 600 new cases, and peaks where it's in the upper 700's. That made me wonder: since going out to restock my fridge / pantry is unavoidable, is it safer to go out during a dip or a peak? Are there any epidemiologists who've worked this out with previous infectious diseases? </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Pennsylvania department of health has adopted this graphic animation! </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> And another Indian! </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> The graph (and video) should be modified by doing a log plot of new reported deaths per million versus a log plot of total reported deaths per million.  In the absence of that it is quite misleading and is virtually certain to lead to widespread misunderstanding. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> I like this a lot.  It seems like a good idea.

But where the heck is the follow-up?

Since this important you should be updating it at least once a week.  You don't have to do it yourself, just modify the intro, not the video, but the blub below the video, by posting a link to someone else that is doing this. </COMMENT 19>

BTW, the numbers are climbing and their average is not terribly off many other countries - Hey economist did you see 39 per million is far less than Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and India's numbers?

<COMMENT 19> It was  always gonna be this way. It was evident early-on that there was manipulation of numbers, like the fact that Russia appeared not to be suffering much infection all the while Europe and parts of the Mid East was getting slammed (something very similar was happening in Turkey too, interesting when you consider who leads these 2 countries......).
Then,suddenly, Turkey & Russia both reported exploding numbers of infections, rising alarmingly fast in both countries in a strangely similar fashion and *both* with death rates that just didn't compute with confirmed infections quickly rising into 6 figures.
The story of what has happened in both Turkey & Russia, countries that no longer have wide-ranging free press to be able to report on and investigate these things at a domestic level, will surface one day and it will be very alarming. 
The Excess Deaths will tell the story and,some day, someone in these countries will lift the lid on all this. </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 1> 27:03 "this is part of the cost of globalization" truest words ever spoke. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Peter Covid19 is real but very far from being a pandemic. Check the death Data. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> I thank you for asking the hard questions. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Good to hear two sensible, knowledeable people discussing this. Thank you. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Swedish scientist has said the same. 50 to 60 percent of US population will get it. Lots of had already. And haven't known it. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> No hype, no proclamations, no hyperbole, no agenda. Wonderful video, thanks. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> This is comparing apple to oranges. Nobody has done statistical analysis of the seasonal flu anti-body. The symptoms of COVID19 are much worst than the flu. What can be measure is number of people who must be hospitalized and, out of those, how many die. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> So we have an illness that, even the gentlemen here agree, we have no idea how lethal it is. Rather than take precautionary measures - what the governments have been doing worldwide - they go about questioning it and the impact on economy! Yes economies have suffered, yes people have lost their jobs, but in the absence of lockdowns these could be far worse. Rather have my life than the economy booming and me resting under 6 feet of dirt! </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Thank you for being scientifically honest and not ideologically driven mixed in with fear. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Spot on. Dr Jay certainly hits the mark of what most intelligent people are thinking. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Thank you for honest, intelligent insights/perspectives. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Very interesting discussion. Thank you. But I don't think I'd like to be in the US right now at all. I live in Switzerland and am grateful every day for being here, where the health care is excellent, the laws are functional but not draconian and the whole issue has never become some political controversy polarising the entire nation. It's been dealt with practically and in a manner that the vast majority of the country supports. It's called living in a democracy, and that has not been significantly undermined in this entire process. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Please do some research on Dr Fauchi.  He's on the side of Bill Gates.  He predicted this pandemic a few years ago.  I believe President Trump knows already. And, check out Dr. Raschid Buttar on YouTube. He knows all about covid-19. They are lying a out the figures.
I also heard that if you were vaccinated with the flu shot, n tested for covid, you will test positive.
I hope this helps yall. Thanks for the info. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> The truth is here for everyone to see now. Dr Rashed A Batter has been exposing the lies to covid 19 a must see on the truth. Thank you for this video, you to have questions like us, appreciate that you guys are honest.✋ </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> This video is the most informative piece I have seen - thank you so much for showing this = to both of you...
ALL should watch the follow up Video as well..
I am pretty certain I had COVID in December and did not get tested at that time.  I was buying items from China DIRECT = person to person with a 9 day transit time.  I do believe I had it...  yes, I do... 

I would be more than willing to give plasma to someone that is sick.. however, it seems like a person that "think" they may have had it needs to have proof-positive before they can get considered to donate.. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> thanks for a good  info </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> thanks for this. I also collected all the evidence that they're lying to us about Coronavirus: @ </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> This is one of the best discussion that I have heard.  Thank you.  I have a scientific training and am shocked at how little the intelligentsia know about science in the 21st century.  We need a better basic science education </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> 27:41 Yes, you were reading our minds! Uh... no thanks! </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 1> 27:03 "this is part of the cost of globalization" truest words ever spoke. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Peter Covid19 is real but very far from being a pandemic. Check the death Data. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> I thank you for asking the hard questions. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Good to hear two sensible, knowledeable people discussing this. Thank you. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Swedish scientist has said the same. 50 to 60 percent of US population will get it. Lots of had already. And haven't known it. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> No hype, no proclamations, no hyperbole, no agenda. Wonderful video, thanks. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> This is comparing apple to oranges. Nobody has done statistical analysis of the seasonal flu anti-body. The symptoms of COVID19 are much worst than the flu. What can be measure is number of people who must be hospitalized and, out of those, how many die. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> So we have an illness that, even the gentlemen here agree, we have no idea how lethal it is. Rather than take precautionary measures - what the governments have been doing worldwide - they go about questioning it and the impact on economy! Yes economies have suffered, yes people have lost their jobs, but in the absence of lockdowns these could be far worse. Rather have my life than the economy booming and me resting under 6 feet of dirt! </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Thank you for being scientifically honest and not ideologically driven mixed in with fear. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Spot on. Dr Jay certainly hits the mark of what most intelligent people are thinking. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Thank you for honest, intelligent insights/perspectives. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Very interesting discussion. Thank you. But I don't think I'd like to be in the US right now at all. I live in Switzerland and am grateful every day for being here, where the health care is excellent, the laws are functional but not draconian and the whole issue has never become some political controversy polarising the entire nation. It's been dealt with practically and in a manner that the vast majority of the country supports. It's called living in a democracy, and that has not been significantly undermined in this entire process. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Please do some research on Dr Fauchi.  He's on the side of Bill Gates.  He predicted this pandemic a few years ago.  I believe President Trump knows already. And, check out Dr. Raschid Buttar on YouTube. He knows all about covid-19. They are lying a out the figures.
I also heard that if you were vaccinated with the flu shot, n tested for covid, you will test positive.
I hope this helps yall. Thanks for the info. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> The truth is here for everyone to see now. Dr Rashed A Batter has been exposing the lies to covid 19 a must see on the truth. Thank you for this video, you to have questions like us, appreciate that you guys are honest.✋ </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> This video is the most informative piece I have seen - thank you so much for showing this = to both of you...
ALL should watch the follow up Video as well..
I am pretty certain I had COVID in December and did not get tested at that time.  I was buying items from China DIRECT = person to person with a 9 day transit time.  I do believe I had it...  yes, I do... 

I would be more than willing to give plasma to someone that is sick.. however, it seems like a person that "think" they may have had it needs to have proof-positive before they can get considered to donate.. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> thanks for a good  info </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> thanks for this. I also collected all the evidence that they're lying to us about Coronavirus: @ </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> This is one of the best discussion that I have heard.  Thank you.  I have a scientific training and am shocked at how little the intelligentsia know about science in the 21st century.  We need a better basic science education </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> 27:41 Yes, you were reading our minds! Uh... no thanks! </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> This is a conversation ignorant of risk theory. They are both speaking within their fields, but are unable to see outside of them.

<COMMENT 2> Hi Jeff you are the funniest comedian </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> For all the times you wish you could be home instead of in the road/tour we don't blame you for all of this. Everyone used to wish for days off but we want them when we want them not this. Enjoy your family & we all look forward to your added stories about them when you get in the road again. </COMMENT 3>

<COMMENT 10> Cool nice awesome video once again.  Glad you are keeping us entertained during all this and looking forward to new content when you load it up. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Lips on your new dummy are way too large.  (Got to make it look more like a teenager today) </COMMENT 11>

Who knows maybe we'll meet in person at a show, or you'll see me in the front row. I'll be easy to recognize just tell the guy's to keep an eye out for a GhostRider/madmax looking fella wearing sunglasses answering the name el RoadHog 🐗. You'll recognize me when you see me...trust me. </COMMENT 12>

<COMMENT 1> This video is super weak. Did you start mailing it in after the 3 millionth subscriber, or the 4 millionth? </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> How about making a minute of the earth on lucid dreams?  I think it will be very cool the subject is interesting </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Thanks! This was super informational </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Presuming you are getting accurate data from other countries. I expect the number of cases in China is at least one magnitude higher. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> @minutephysics, I'm afraid you have a SERIOUS error here. What you are plotting is log(dy/dt) vs. log(y), so a straight line means log(dy/dt) = k*log(y), or dy/dt = y^k. 
Thus, y = exp(integral of y^(k-1)*t). Since k < 1, this is an exponential only in form because as y grows the y^(k-1) term shrinks. If k = 0.5, then by the time there are a million cases, that term is 10^-5 of the value it started out with, assuming that k stayed constant. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> America doesn't seem at all interested in containing this epidemic, especially now with the riots happening. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Let’s go ahead and take Chinese numbers with a whole salt mine full of salt. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Nice 
#ashoksaini </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Make a video answering this question:
Is AI smarter than us? </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> The Philippines is handling this horribly. We don't even know how our curve looks because the government won't conduct mass testing as adequate levels. And we're relaxing quarantine measures (after THREE MONTHS) before we've even seen any evidence that the curve is flattening. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Roses are red violets are blue why does the Karen think covid-19 is just the ordinary flu </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Can you revisit with current data and talk about why so many countries demonstrate exponential decay, but not USA?  I also tried looking at new cases as ppm and displayed not as absolute numbers but rate of change. There appears to be a period "bump" approximately every 7 days.  Is this real or a result of how data is collected? </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> How's india doing ?Plz reply </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Lately, Republicans have been using the Total Cases statistic to argue that blue states have a worse response to this pandemic than red states.
This video beautifully explains why changes in New Cases is the most relevant statistic if we want to talk about a given government's response to this pandemic. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Two months later, and I'm still checking this graph on a daily basis. I've noticed that rather than a flat or smooth curve, my state's version of "leveling out" is a series of dips where the weekly infection rate is between 500 to 600 new cases, and peaks where it's in the upper 700's. That made me wonder: since going out to restock my fridge / pantry is unavoidable, is it safer to go out during a dip or a peak? Are there any epidemiologists who've worked this out with previous infectious diseases? </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Pennsylvania department of health has adopted this graphic animation! </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> And another Indian! </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> The graph (and video) should be modified by doing a log plot of new reported deaths per million versus a log plot of total reported deaths per million.  In the absence of that it is quite misleading and is virtually certain to lead to widespread misunderstanding. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> I like this a lot.  It seems like a good idea.

But where the heck is the follow-up?

Since this important you should be updating it at least once a week.  You don't have to do it yourself, just modify the intro, not the video, but the blub below the video, by posting a link to someone else that is doing this. </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 1> It’s good to live in hot 🥵 country.. here it’s more than 45c ..I’m waiting for August to reach 50c </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Coronavirus will last until March 2021 </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> No. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> I don’t want it on my bday, it is what it is !! It’s not our fault! It will just be sad if it’s not over in the summer </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Did this used to be crash course? </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> I found out how to get rid of Sars... Just get the bolsheviks! </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Outside temp: 108
Daily cases in my state: 1,100+ surpassing even New York
That would be a big fat *NO* </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Its not going away for 5 plus years. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> What </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> So you think your mask matters. MOSQUITO. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Trump this it will. Magically.  The only question is...........will Trump go away in this summer? </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Singapore say no. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> no. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> I’m in Miami. And Miami has the most cases by A LOT in the whole Florida and it’s always humid down here </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> India it is  increasing though is summer </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> I Hope To Stay Healthy Until COVID-19 Go Away This Summer! </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> I really want covid19 to end and this year is ruining my life and it’s so ridiculous that I have been quarantined for months and now it needs to end and otherwise doing online school again next year and it’s ok maybe 2021 will be better and shouldn’t lie to trumps ideas </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> I feel like it would be the same as February </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Pollution is the problem, Wuhan, Milan, New York now Rio and the worst hit the poorer areas. Smokers also have a bigger problem people's respiratory systems are already compromised with pollution. The possible cause that children are far less affected and the more affluent people like Prince Charles survive it. Early intervention, proper diet and good vitamin levels in the body will beat the virus. The rural areas of the USA are also doing fine, the same where I live in Australia. Another case in point after the lock down in various places infections quickly subsided result of cleaner air meant less transmissions. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Idk where anyone else is, but Summer's here where I'm at already, and I have Covid19 </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 1> Ford is saying Ontario needs 24 billion because of the sickness , he is hooking up with JT , for some of that money but it all going to come from Ontario tax payers anyways , so why not let the province go into 24 billion more in debt ,, all JT offered  of our own money was 14 billion for all the provinces, why would ford all of a sudden come  up with 150 million for rural Ontario for cell phone and internet , some thing they all ready have and rural Ontario is the north , it's to get away from everything , that is why a lot live up there but Doud Ford wants to impose on them  the little privacy they have , ask ford ware he go to that 150 million, it could be used for a lot better things in the north then phones and internet, that Elon musk is going to give internet free any ways by satilite ,. There is more going on then he is saying , Jesus Christ is the way truth and life 🙏❤️ peace. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Wow you Fords are a piece of work!  I'm pretty sure between Rob Ford and Doug Ford that Canada has seen enough of this disgusting Criminal activity. Doug you look like you're about to pop from just mad consumption of alcohol and whatever you can stuff in your face. Open up the gyms and and the parks for the kids you disgusting excuse for a human being. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> They all look like zombies. Observe the video folks. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Deepkake video. Look at Dougs chin and collar. Green screen...just like the movies. Just look at his chin and tie area </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Your a terrible Premier just open your economy already... This virus hasn't killed a single person under age 40 in British Columbia. What a joke. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> The narrative is just getting absurd, hey maybe there will be a second wave of Covid from the ten thousands of packed in protesters you in the media agitate  and your government race baits? But no can't open a playground in a rural area. This is a disgusting joke, this isnt about black lives, or a virus  this is about control. Make no mistake we will NEVER go back to normal, the "new normal" is a dystopian society with no rights, manufactured racial tension/hatred, and forced poverty. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Covid 19 under control???   Plataued???
Military forces need to be involved for clarity objectively.
Opening is not important without any solution. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Chrissy E has to go. Over 3 months into this thing and front line workers are still not getting PPE? You say there is enough gear but — is it not being delivered? Is it not being worn properly? What exactly is the problem?? 3 months. 3 LONG months and we still don’t have this part buckled down?? Elliott is a first class failure, working above the detail. And stop smirking or smiling from here on in when you address us. There is absolutely NOTHING amusing about any of this you syllogistically deficient donkey. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> What about those of us that are on disability? We are on a fixed income, just like the Seniors. Food costs have gone up. Delivery costs and medication costs have all increased. Instead you hand out all this money to students, that are probably living under their parents roof. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> 20:23
01:29
02:29 </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Not everyone will get there job back.. Thats all part of the plan. After all the money they have to pay... They will pay theyre deths then also leaves alot of employees behind because many wont have the budget to pay them because of.. Some impact of besyness. That having less costumers </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> So many crossing province to province you frogot to say too... </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> You will pay dearly for your decisions....
Jail is waiting for you!
Destroying the country is not a small matter </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Open the North they will be devasted without something from the toursist. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Psychological warfare is barbaric and brutal - but in a different way from physical warfare. Non stop gaslighting by the media leads to artificial fracturing   of family and friend relationships, and loss of civil liberties from fear based control. Painful and distressing to experience!!!!!! </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> cool, subscribe subscribe 👠 🌕 🍃 💝 </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Ford is related to Chief Clancy Wiggum, right? </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> People in the back ? </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Doug needs to comment more on the social distancing rules and the shutdown. Clearly a lot of medical professionals are behind the protests meaning the lockdown is a sham. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Open everything up. Enough already </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 1> I love how she says we don’t have the technology to microchip people xD </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> I have heard from a few sources that the US Army believes they will have some type of vaccine by the end of 2020.    Anyone else have any information on that?   I’m from a military family  but none of us are Doctors or researchers.  My son is active duty with 2 deployments and now  JAG attorney.    No experts on this in my family. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Wow.  A channel with a smart and educated audience.  Aka not too many red state Fox fed trump,twats </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Excellent content. I’ve been researching this virus and I’m really looking forward to results of the many rct’s. To me, Tocilizumab and Convalescent Plasma Transfusion seem like the more effective treatments out there, but I have only recently realized the extent of endothelial involvement </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57CSfTR34d0 </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> I have a question.  Why can't you just test say people entering the country instead of quarantine them.  So if they don't test positive then let them go? </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Dr Seheult, you are also our hero. Thank you for educating us (healthcare).. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Marvelous. I will be listening again. It was very comprehensive. So much good information to help me to help myself. I had a lot of blood vessel damage during  brain surgery, twice
Just glad that you Explained how that works thank you. I'd like to know how it affects someone whose eyes are weak do to a brain tumor. And how the virus affects the brain.
Thank you so much for your presentation it's exactly what I was looking for. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> There's a lot of big words that someone who doesn't know all the words could miss chunks of meaning from this video... Thrombosis is the thing I am most unsure about, I do know of deep vein thrombosis so assumed that section of the video was saying a lot of people with covid19 will have plaque forming inside their veins because that's what happens with deep vein thrombosis.

The picture with the fat man and the skinny man was very easy to understand but It does make it look worse for fat people than in reality. If skinny people still get struck down by covid19 then as a fat person I sure feel like I don't need to panic and start running down the hallway and spam into the wall...

I like that you guys know what minor tweaks could be done to improve a person's chances like which vitamins they should be having and hot cold treatment however can a patient be sure that no matter which medical hospital they go to in the world that those doctors will also care and know this? Also how many saunas are in hospitals to be able to try hot cold? Should everyone be trying hot cold for the common cold or flu? Seems to me like hot cold seems to be a general treatment that's good like how it's good for a person to be face down to improve their breathing when there's phlegm. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> One question 
As far as I understand nobody have isolated Covid19 Virus. 
Is the Good Dr talking about Covid in general ? </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Lose weight. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Great initiative by MedCram team👌 </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> See why we should END WAGE SLAVERY? See now? It’s insane because no one can work for 2-4-24 months or TEN YEARS ++? See? </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> As someone that knows Nothing about Molecular Biology or Medicine, and being frustrated by the widespread superficiality of media presentations and details I was very intrigued and interested to hear you speak on the virus, and the medicinal practices and details associated with it. I feel I have a greatly improved framework to understand what is going on around me that has caused the globe to come to a violent halt. I appreciate your time and look forward to more of your videos, thanks for your expertise and introducing me to a new world of ideas, terms and in-depth perspective. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> *STUPID QUESTION: DO ANTIHISTAMINES SUPPRESS INNATE IMMUNITY?*
It's spring and I cannot function without antihistamines.  This year, Diphenhydramine, is my preferred solution because the once a day pills don't carry me beyond 5 hours.  
I only need these from Feb through July. Am I (male 53 with no other comorbidity) at a potentially increased risk? </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> https://www.deccanherald.com/science-and-environment/zinc-hydroxychloroquine-found-effective-in-some-covid-19-patients-study-836561.html spread the word trump might be right! </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> The PROBLEM with the VA study: The one's who got the drug were further along on the virus than the one's who didn't. In other words they were much sicker. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> @MedCram, why were several of your COVID lessons removed?  You provide great, objective information. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Great hosting lol from Ireland </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Chinese Authorities Admits  cover up 
World health organization  is corrupted
My information was correct I have written the details in the past .

Actual date was December  28 2019

<COMMENT 1> bill gates profits from the virus created. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> The amount of Karens here in this comment section is so sad.. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Ur a globalist   Guess have the cure    It will be a shot with a chip in it it easy to come up with when your behind it </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Your the one behind it. Your foundation gave all the statistics . It was your scientist come with all the  facts of how you how works </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> The people who were alive during the 1918 Spanish Flu outbreak said that the only people to get it were the ones who took vaccines because they were told that soldiers were coming home with infectious diseases. The vaccines caused the people to be sick and the  illness was labelled as Spanish Flu to cover the real cause. The unvaccinated didn’t get it even though they were taking care of the sick.

The people who are sick now with flu-like symptoms are the ones who took the flu vaccine. That’s why they are sick. Refuse to take any vaccine. They are slow kill weapons. Bill Gates should be put in prison for the rest of his life. Alternatively he should be put into an institution for the criminally insane. What he is trying to do is worse than Hitler did. His stated aim is “to create a healthy market for vaccines.” This is one reason for this false pandemic. The other reason is depopulation.

We have inalienable human rights under Common Law. Also under the Nuremberg Code which is Article 7 of the United Nations' International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and is the basis for International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects proposed by the World Health Organisation.

They cannot make anyone take any vaccine. It has to be voluntary, otherwise it is coercion.

See here: The ten points of the Nuremberg Code

The ten points of the code were given in the section of the verdict entitled "Permissible Medical Experiments”

“The voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential.
The experiment should be such as to yield fruitful results for the good of society, unprocurable by other methods or means of study, and not random and unnecessary in nature.
The experiment should be so designed and based on the results of animal experimentation and a knowledge of the natural history of the disease or other problem under study that the anticipated results will justify the performance of the experiment.
The experiment should be so conducted as to avoid all unnecessary physical and mental suffering and injury.
No experiment should be conducted where there is an a priori reason to believe that death or disabling injury will occur; except, perhaps, in those experiments where the experimental physicians also serve as subjects.
The degree of risk to be taken should never exceed that determined by the humanitarian importance of the problem to be solved by the experiment.
Proper preparations should be made and adequate facilities provided to protect the experimental subject against even remote possibilities of injury, disability, or death.
The experiment should be conducted only by scientifically qualified persons. The highest degree of skill and care should be required through all stages of the experiment of those who conduct or engage in the experiment.
During the course of the experiment the human subject should be at liberty to bring the experiment to an end if he has reached the physical or mental state where continuation of the experiment seems to him to be impossible.
During the course of the experiment the scientist in charge must be prepared to terminate the experiment at any stage, if he has probable cause to believe, in the exercise of the good faith, superior skill and careful judgment required of him that a continuation of the experiment is likely to result in injury, disability, or death to the experimental subject.”

Anyone who thinks that vaccines are safe and effective should take a look at vaccine package inserts. 

Here is one https://www.naturalnews.com/images/Flulaval-Influenza-Vaccine-Insert-600.jpg

Here is another one. This is the MMR vaccine: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B7vHq9RIAAIp5sV.jpg

And another: https://odiariodeumet.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/adacel1.png?w=640

By listing the side effects that have been reported, the manufacturer is telling you that it is NOT SAFE and that you take it AT YOUR OWN RISK!

No vaccine has ever been shown to be safe and is therefore a medical experiment. They cannot make anyone take it. Stand up for your rights. Say No! </COMMENT 5>

<COMMENT 1> The Cuomo brothers, Andrew and Chris, Dumb and Dumber.
Dumb is also known as Chris. His job is to misinform the American public every day on fake news CNN
. Dumber, Andrew. Better known as  Criminal Cuomo. His intent is to destroy the state of NY.
Highest taxes in the country, no guns, no fracking, no jobs, and if he had is way, no prisons and we would have illegals living in our homes.
According to him and I quote this idiot...  “America was never that great anyway.” </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Chris Como you're a pussy </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> the stats are abundantly clear : if you are not 70 or greater in a nursing home or hospice  with dementia , heart and kidney failure or  end stage cancer you have little to fear except fear itself. Despite the media hysterics and very misleading misrepresentations for the vast majority its no bigger threat than the seasonal flu. All this lockdown BS is completely unverified pulled out the ass BS to appease the ignorant and cowardly . </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> I wonder if that's why Fredo felt good enough to go look at his house during the daytime and yell at a biker. </COMMENT 4>

<COMMENT 13> Is anyone else baffled that CNN doesn't close down their comment sections? Don't get me wrong, I'm glad they don't-- they would experience massive backlash ala STREISAND EFFECT if they tried. But it seems like a bitch move they would attempt, lol. Especially when everyone is calling Cuomo out for faking his illness. "The beast comes at night" oh please. </COMMENT 13>

<COMMENT 1> What happens if the person gets infected by a family member during his/her 10 days lockdown period & reaches its peak during the 4 days work period? (please bear in mind that no testing has been done since for many other countries it is not easy to access these facilities). </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> This idea has already been adopted by a private company a few years ago. I think, carrying out this idea in a controlled environment for a certain period of time and at a limited scale can validate the authenticity of this idea. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> a foolish solution? A 10 day lockdown? The main concern is addressing people going to beaches </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Nobody wants to reopen the economy anymore </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> I’m afraid of an uncertain future. I don’t know if i can survive. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> The economics of the virus.  This is what happens when a morally corrupt society is aided and abetted.  We could have a much more fully comprehensible by population inclusion in prosperity with morals because slavery would not exist and our environments would be safe.  I mentioned that the lower pollution allowed me to walk more last week.  Yesterday, I had to use my professional 3M aspirator like the one on my home page picture.  The pollution was close to 50 versus the 2? when I posted last week.  As soon as I took the aspirator off to smell the air, my back began to tense up so badly I didn't feel like walking.  I put the aspirator back on and voila, tension gone.  I don't know if it's just the physics of pollution displacing oxygen or the nerve effect of the pollution on breathing, probably both.  Also, on the walk, just like in my neighborhood, I was sexually harassed by four men.  One spit at me.  A marked increase in aggression with the pollution.  Funny, I don't torture anything or anybody when the pollution increases but the morons of the world that get paid for their contribution are permitted this heinous luxury whenever.  I've had the police here four time this summer and I don't know if I'll bother calling them again.  Officer McMichael said "So what" in response ton my neighbor's illegal fire burning when I called about mental harassment, theft, vandalism, and trespassing and refused to speak with the probable culprit for prevention's sake.  That's the kind of attitude that brought us the virus and police brutality in the long run.  Everybody is just going to keep their mouths shut until there is a horrible irreversible disaster we cannot recover from without creating worse slave nations like communism for instance, the only other choice. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> It is seemingly sad for me because here in my country we cannot sooner replace manual labors into automatic machine which means we STILL need humans to do on the spot job. Operational working space where they needs someone's accuracy to finish a work surely cannot be replaced directly. So im 100% agree with his strategy to do four days work and 10days lockdown and self quarantine. In case some people accidentally infected right before they go to work a day after, this is the company's effort to maximize their health protocol so they can avoid second infection before those infected people start working again and send them home to quarantine theirselves and allow who passed or un-infected to do their regular works. Slowly but sure we can regrow our economy and no more layoffs or homeless people because of this pandemic 🙏🏻 </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> It seems to be a good concept, but how will it work towards getting the economy back to normal? </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> I would love that the government of my country pay attention at any proposal that people of the world is trying to figure it out to return to normal. Argentina, in fact, Buenos Aires and sorroundigs, with less than 1000 deaths, is in Q since March 20th.... </COMMENT 9>

<COMMENT 15> The exit strategy is to turn off your television and live your life. We all know now that the numbers were wildly overestimated to induce fear and panic for political reasons as well as to push the vaccine agenda. Event 201 and Lock-Step pg.18 will tell you all you need to know about their new world order plans. Bill gates and Fauci have a vested interest in giving every man, women, and child their poisonous and dangerous vaccines. If they get their way you won't be able to do anything without an immunity passport. And once the contact tracing app is baked into the phones your every move will be monitored. We all know the tests are faulty and that the death certificates are being changed to raise the number of covid19 deaths. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> The US does not need to worry about a second wave I guess. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> I may be wrong but there is no real evidence suggesting hygiene and masks + travel restrictions with rigorous quarantine and testing would not be enough to keep the growth rate of the virus below 1. China seems to be doing well, Taiwan too, South Korea as well, even Sweden without any formal lockdown didn't fare horribly bad. If people are too dumb to use proper hygiene and masks (given those are available), it is just natural selection doing its thing. </COMMENT 17>

<COMMENT 7> <COVID-19 TRUTH>
*Most people won’t get the virus.*
*Most of the people who get it won’t display symptoms.*
*Most of the people who display symptoms will only be mildly sick.*
*Most of the people with severe symptoms will never be critically ill.*
*And most of the people who get critically ill will survive.*

This is borne out by the numerous serological studies which show, again and again, that the infection fatality ratio is on par with flu.
( https://swprs.org/studies-on-covid-19-lethality/ )
There is no science – and increasingly little rational discussion – to justify the lockdown measures and overall sense of global panic.
Nevertheless, it’s always good to get official acknowledgement of the truth, even if it has to be leaked.
Here are three leaks showing that those in power know that the coronavirus poses no threat, and in no way justifies the lockdown that is going to destroy the livelihoods of so many.
1. “IT’S ALL BULLSHIT!”
On May 26th Dr Alexander Myasnikov, Russia’s head of coronavirus information, gave an interview to former-Presidential candidate Ksenia Sobchak in which he apparently let slip his true feelings.
( https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/05/27/its-all-bullsht-russias-coronavirus-information-chief-says-of-virus-fears-a70398 )
Believing the interview over, and the camera turned off, Myasnikov said:
It’s all bullshit […] It’s all exaggerated. It’s an acute respiratory disease with minimal mortality […] Why has the whole world been destroyed? That I don’t know,”

<COMMENT 8> Action speaks louder than words. If there is an excuse not to wear mask on public speaking/announcement, why other average person can not have other excuse not to wear mask at all time. Lead by example, show how it is done for everyone without excuse by acting it out from a behavior level. Senior officials should wear masks on high profile public announcement/speaking to give impression to the public to follow the same rule and sense of urgency. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Wearing masks has NEVER been established to prevent disease.

When you’re wearing a mask, you’re inducing an hypoxic injury, Pseudo hypoxia.
When you wear a mask you are restricting airflow
You’re also breathing in more Carbon dioxide
Now you’re creating a pseudo hypoxic state, on top of that you’re creating stress because you’re body is now having to suck oxygen through something that’s obstructing the airway

We BREATHE oxygen
We need oxygen
We breathe out carbon dioxide
How long would an animal or human last by just breathing carbon dioxide?
Not very long, they need oxygen within a minute and half. Things start to shut off.
In medicine and trauma they’re taught 3 things
“When in doubt go back to your ABCs”
Airway
Breathing
Circulation

When you’re wearing a mask you’re reducing your ability to oxygenate.
Now that you’ve thrown your body into chronic stress, you’re increasing your cortisol levels.
Which is your stress hormone. Cortisol going up suppresses your immune system
You get into something called “Sympathetic mimetic drive”
This is like having a car in park, and stepping on the accelerator

ASK THE QUESTION! Why?
To make us more susceptible?! </COMMENT 9>

<COMMENT 9> Le confinement a du sens à la seule et unique condition que pendant cette période, l’état augmente considérablement les capacités des hôpitaux quitte à créer des hôpitaux de campagne par régions. Le déconfinement pourra alors être fait au niveau national pour que les gens s’auto -immunisent et ceux qui ne réussiront pas à s’auto-immuniser, les hôpitaux seront alors structurés et prêts à les recevoir en nombre.
Si les moyens des hôpitaux ne sont pas augmentés, les contagions reprendront de plus belle car il n’y a aucune raison que le virus s’arrête par enchantement.
Mettons-nous au travail pour construire ces hôpitaux de campagne. Les citoyens seront volontaires pour apporter leur aides. </COMMENT 9>

<COMMENT 1> Well little did you know I can't afford to fly. HAHAHAHA </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> So you pay $15 thousand for a holiday get to the airport and your temperature is over normal .  No Holiday for you and your lose all your money . Good
Luck getting it back from travel  insurance .    Dunno how they will get around this one ? </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Air travelers = SUPER SPREADERS </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> We are such a weak society these days. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> The problem is if tickets are expensive people cant fly. People will be making a lot less money if they even have a job. In the future there will be less airlines and Leds planes. I predict  a permanent 20% increase  over the next few years  assuming countries subsidize.. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> i would take you much more seriously mate if you'd wear a mask properly, THE ENTIRE TIME -__- </COMMENT 6>

<COMMENT 11> What a load of bollocks this is.....as soon as the number of travellers progressively increase the airlines will throw caution to the wind for the sake of profits!  Just remember the old saying ‘you fly at your own risk’. </COMMENT 11>

<COMMENT 1> this is gonna blow up big time for trump, ppl are willing to risk catching Covid19 to assert thier rights to protest & such an important issue that cant wait, this is all on you now trump, 150,000 the next milestone for you to fret over sadly not far off </COMMENT 1>

<COMMENT 9> I won’t forgive them if I see surge in COVID cases. </COMMENT 9>

<COMMENT 11> Coronavirus news is boring skip please.... </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Video is fake news ordered by top US virus fools It’s an attempt to seriously harm a population deliberately The “virus “ is FAKE it’s used as a TERRORISM tool( Weapon )  to kill as many people as possible in non virus “ways “ and terrorize innocent people in a horrific example of government sponsored US large scale grand active terrorism extremism Video needs to be remove by google immediately </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> This is the straw that broke the camel's back. 2nd spread is gonna be more devastating than the first. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> WOW! This is so disheartening to think these brave protesters could get sick or die from this horrible virus. I am glad states are setting up testing sites and changing the exposure rules.

Impeached trump will probably shut them down, he wants the majority of testing reserved for him and his corrupt administration.

It is heartening seeing most everyone of the protesters wearing masks. Even that young woman handing out free masks and handsanitiser, thank you. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Darwinism at its best </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> now what you gonna do all ya losers die for protesting for a crooky nigga </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> 0:57 NOT wearing a mask. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> American military - Hitlers army. Germany won. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Everyone that attended a protest should be told to self isolate for 2 weeks. Leftists piss me off. Here we were spent all this time in shut down to flatten the curve, then once the curve was flattened and we started reopening with social distancing, they start having massive protests, which triggered mass looting and burning of businesses. Now there are untold numbers of people in retail with no job to return to. Another thing that has me hot under the collar is, they continue to hold these stupid protests. How many freaking protests do you need? Protests have already been going on for over 7 days in many cities, and they continue into affinity. I guess they're gonna crowd together and raise hell until they all catch Coronavirus. Then they'll probably be protesting, because there's not enough ventilators for them. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Yes, protestors better test for Covid 19. Pay the test by yourself! Don't use the taxpayers HARD earn money! </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 2> Looks like Mike Harris did it again . First to the disabled whom he dehoused and stole billions from and now to the elderly. 
If you protect such a man , with whatever reasoning, you might pay for his sins, too, on the day of judgement. I, personally, will stand witness against him.
Do not kid yourselves, Ford and Tory will protect him because he is well-connected. </COMMENT 2>

<COMMENT 5> The provinces stop cutting budgets in sectors so they can funnel that extra tax payer money into construction projects that politicians and organized crime embezzle millions from
Stop corruption and the problem gets fixed with more money in the pot serving where it’s intended to go </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Fox News anchors all over this video,  judging by the comments. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> I came back here because this was the last CBC video with the comments turned on. Every one posted since has the comments turned off. You are supposed to be the national broadcaster, CBC. What is the problem with allowing active discourse on your posted videos? This is the last CBC video that I will watch. Considering the level of journalistic integrity in evidence on your news broadcasts over the last decade or so, I don’t think I’m likely to miss much. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> This is all a sham at this point. turdeau is killing the country's economy, millions of job lost, suicides, depression, businesses that will never come back etc... all of that for a virus equivalent to a bad case of seasonal flu. Numbers around the world confirm this. the WHO just confirmed that it's 10x less contagious than their prediction. (wrong since the beginning) and confirmed that a second wave is non existent. Wake up people, this was a false alarm and they knew for a while now. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> The CBC lying for their liberal masters. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> As a health care worker with reduced hours...promises of topping up our pay has still not come to pass.... entering week 12 of severe pay loss while others getting full CERB... ridiculous... </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Its the human way </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> What about cerb for Canadians aftet june.
Is there is any finencal support for Canadian after June 6 2020? </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> This is perfect. I stopped counting at 70. 70 in a row negative comments about our weasel leader and CBC.....so good to see people catching on to these leftist scammers </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> When will the CBC start asking real questions and holding this federal government accountable for all of this massive spending? Where will the money come from? How large is the current deficit with all this covid spending? How much will taxes increase? When will the frderal government stop funding the media and the CBC? </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> The elderly need companionship love from their families more than anything that is their medecine. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> I’M NOT HOMOSEXUAL But Mashallah our PM is a good looking man. I’m not a feminist either but this is where us men need to learn from women. Like bruh.... your tie is more to the right. We men simply don’t pay attention to detail. I just happened to be among those who do but yo ....seriously, I think we should start </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Sounds like instead of puppy mills we have senior mills and I am so glad that they are being addressed and cleaned up </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> PM with good heart </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> What about extra money for the disabled?  It was mentioned briefly then no mention of it since. I live on a pension far lower than any others.  Please update </COMMENT 19>

<DESCRIPTION> I think there is potential for improvement in what we have done in Sweden, quite clearly,” Anders Tegnell of the Public Health Agency told Swedish media on ... </DESCRIPTION>
<TAGS> ['web-digital-stories', 'Sweden', 'Coronavirus', 'COVID-19'] </TAGS>
<COMMENT 1> Athletes, businessmen, scientists and most people always want to do things better.
So that a scientist evaluates and believes that it is possible to do better is not strange.
The only people who have almost never made mistakes are politicians. They want to be re-elected.
So when Tegnell says that
- No, we have definitely not changed line, neither I nor the authority. We still think it's a good line we keep. It can be adapted and it can be improved and we have been working on it all the time, so that everything else becomes a misunderstanding. However, I always think it's important to be self-critical, Anders Tegnell said.
This is exactly how it should be.

My county today has 100 deaths per 1M, Skåne a county with 1.3M inhabitants and Sweden's third largest city Malmö has 149 deaths per 1M in an opened Sweden with the same tactics as Stockholm with 855 death per 1M. New York have 1563 death per 1M.
The question is then has higher mortality in Sweden with the COVID-19 tactic or with a long-term failed elderly care with more profit goals than care. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> the more pensions die the less they have to pay pensions every month </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> If they aren't testing or tracing how in the world would they know what the impact of keeping schools open is? Is this another hunch? </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> But we got valuable data. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Good Job, Sweden </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Fail is fail, there are many failed scientist in history. Do you know there are many scientist didn’t agree with Einstein in history? </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> the swedish experiment failed </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> What a stupid man and I laugh from denmark </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> I'm from Sweden. This is fake news. He did NOT say that. It's sad how things get twisted. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> So there is someone out there believing herd immunity with scientific reasons?! Jesus </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> He sounds like  'you die because you are old ' </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> What a surprise. They thought the knew better than every other country in the world and it misfired. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Isolate the vulnerable and let the healthy get back to work. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Better??? You’re accomplishment, .....killed elderly people , good job!! 😢 </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> I am LIVING in sweden, the swedish goverment is totally crazy, the world sees that money is more importent than peoples life in Sweden, like GOD/Bible says, BEHIND AL EVIL IS MONEY, and you can see "perfect" example in sweden, swedish goverment was talking about economy and money and comparing economy in this crisis with other countries. and how much "this" corona" will cost to those other countries that are in lockdown, now they begin to understand their total wrong strategy.. 
I Belive that this "swedish strategy" was simply not a strategy at al from the beginning, they just choose example Tegnel and other "specialists" in this area only  to support this passiv and useless goverment even if that was against science so long as it support the passive goverment style., and the goverment didnt know how to handle and put laws and make people to obey, i belive swedish goverment  just simply have no idea how to rule a country atleast this party socialdemokraterna, its just uselesss. they have reacted this way long before corona came to sweden, they have just waited and waited and just being passive that is the way they do and suddenly try with "experts" try to make their passive way right, its nonsens. this is the way goverment have been reaction to almost al situations in sweden, example with terrorist exactly same story there, in sweden we have atleast 100-200+ terrorist who have killed, they live free and get money and apartment and no gail.... same passive "strategy there... its al about passive with this goverment, that is the keyword in sweden, PASSIVE... Greetings to al nations and God bless you al </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Every Swedish should consider injecting snake venom into their blood to generate antibody and be immune to snake venom. Do it pls! </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Seems to me they just need to secure the elderly better because the corona kills the old but not the healthy in Canada not 1 child has died but lots have died from suicide and from no medical treatment because of the shut down </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Survival of the fittest. Sweden knows this and that's why they're so strong after so many centuries. They let the weak die and so they are strong. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Lockdown-done-right like in New Zealand works too, with much fewer death. Since all netizens are saying Sweden’s method is the best, I just follow the consensus. And all of them agree that casualties among the elderly folks are inevitable. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Well, at least their country isn't on fire. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 5> Hoo boy, if this pans out the conspiracy nuts will start talking about The Island of Dr Moreau </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> I don't think these guys could talk if you tied there hands behind there back </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Great presentation. One last aspect, caveat. Llama protein is ‘foreign’ to our immune system and could therefore lead to an immune response against it, similar to a human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) immune response. Could that be a HAMA - Llama? I feel I now need to add, ding dong, to the end of that! </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> ¡¡¡CUIDADO LLAMAS!!! </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Brilliant. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> I have seen studies on this in 2019, the one thing we are looking into is response to human WBC. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Antibodies > vaccines </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Therapy animals about to get real </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> awesome were gonna be sved by the perubian Lamas!! </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> I am going to buy a llama </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> I didn't know Belgium was upstate. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Yay, Winter!! </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Biotech blows my mind. How did researchers know they could use bacteria to produce long chain proteins? It’s fascinating. Wished sometimes I choose a career path in the medical research field. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> people actually believe llamas can help them ? 😂 </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Seems cool but impractical.  We already know how to make vaccines.  Because SARS-COV-2 doesn't kill everyone it infects, the human immune system seems adequate at dealing with it. The llama antibody treatment probably won't be ready before the ones in development are ready. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Lamas with antibodies is better than a madman with a Twitter account! TRUMP LIED, PEOPLE DIED!! </COMMENT 20>

<DESCRIPTION> During the coronavirus lockdowns, air traffic was largely grounded. Now it is gradually starting up again, but there's a long way to go - also in terms of safety ... </DESCRIPTION>

<COMMENT 1> If you have a question about the coronavirus crisis or COVID-19, ask our science correspondent Derrick Williams here! #askDerrick </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> So sad to be seeing lots of shops closing due to this pandemic. Is Chloroquine really gonna help? </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Fly "Corona Air" and we take the worry out of flying. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Bathroom on plane is a major concern as well as mostly recirculated air system. Basically, you better have covid antibodies before getting on a plane. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Couldn't the successful vaccine maker license manufacturers for the vaccines in different countries? </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Coronavirus tests should be mandatory for all flights  until we beat it. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Half the world still in lockdown. 
Let's get that vacation! </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Who are these doughnuts ? </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> The air is circulating in the plane so any in pathogen  in there will possibly visit everybody .like legionaires disease in the air conditioning. So in my humble opinion it doesn't matter where you sit ,if you could open the windows ,all the air would rush out would the passengers be sucked out ? I don't know . Maybe each passenger could have their own air supply like a diver ,they would possibly have to wear a nappy in case the needed the toilet ,. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> VERY. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Regardless where you are seated, the moment cabin crew open up the oven, the smell of food rapidly fill up the whole cabin and remains for some time. For me that shows how fast the air molecules travel within the cabin...virus travel in similar ways. </COMMENT 11>

<COMMENT 13> 0:50
11:52

<COMMENT 14> Why is he even talking about boarding last as a form of  social distancing to protect yourself?

People are more concerned about catching the virus while they are inside the plane with all the other passengers </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> People think about what’s cost effective for airlines but they’ve been cramming human beings in more and more crowded spaces to increase their revenue for years. Don’t come and tell me that they care about customers and the possibility of them getting sick, they only care of eventually being able to make mass flying again the only possible way of transportation. They’ll change nothing and super crowded flights are going to be even more expensive. I don’t trust the flight industry to come out better from this pandemic but worst, for its customers. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Watching this a day before flying from Tokyo to Mexico City... </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> this is BS man, you're in an enclosed space with recycled air with many people for hours. i came here for facts, not paid endorsements by the air flight industry </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> They could install uvc lights inside the air ducts. That disinfects the recycled air </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Does the interviewed prof said anything new, or useful or valuable? </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Not flying anytime soon with countries still imposing 14 day containment/quarantine.  There goes your vacation in a hotel or house. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 1> As always, we'd love to include your questions in our upcoming shows! What would you like to know about the coronavirus pandemic? #askDerrick </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Dude i live in Sweden and i dont whanna go to School like Why not just close it </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> As a German Biochemist Ph D my view is, since more than 20 years, we 
KNOW! - The cases of Diabetes will DOUBLE! What do WE do about it? 
Nothing, Zero, Zilch. We KNOW how to get obese easily, fast and cheap. 
We KNOW, smoking is not the best thing to do. We KNOW - Alcohol may not 
benefit us. We KNOW so many things - how to live WELL - how to become 
resilient. We KNOW - What to do - and what to avoid. We have increasing 
numbers of Smart Persons, who KNOW now very well, they easily can ignore
 all good advice. We call it: Therapy Resistance. How many of this smart
 persons end up on ICU? I meet everyday very courageous persons, not 
caring about any pandemic - as they KNOW- they are fit enough to deal 
with a challenge. Health and Resilience is a Life long program. Waste of
 time to say that... Fuel the economy and do what thou willst... </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Give it a year. Trying predict their success is like trying to predict the winner of a football game before half time. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Not a single country doing enough tests, reporting true numbers of both new cases and deaths, including my own. So, Humanity is doomed folks. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Well done DW! Keep science scientific. Don't turn it into a political farce. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> here in the province of quebec,canada , 4500 death for a population 8 1/5 million with a partial lockdown.The difference is that sweden`s economy  didnt stop.I suppose that the economy is more important in sweden. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Immunity is in born . Isolation & social distancing will do only . Follow Vegeterian diet .Do away with out side home entertainment . </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> The people who love to tout "herd immunity" most likely have no idea how it actually works, and are very unlikely to bother learning how it works. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Is the corona going to peter out like sars 1 and mers ? </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Swedish model failed. Period. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> we can not call doing nothing  as a  "model" tho AXD </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> DE News seems to criticise every country in the world bar Germany. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> So if having covid 19 doesn't furnish immunity how could a vaccine? This video has a major flaw. This antibody theory with testing w respect to covid must also be flawed as well. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> No more information on the number of "active cases" and "total recovered" in Worldmeter website.  So Sweden joins UK and Netherlands.  This may be the sign of thing out of control and don't want to report. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> We are learning more about this virus everyday but for those who trying to downplay the seriousness of this disease I think they are being foolish. We will never really the real death toll because most countries were not prepared for this. By 5he time that we have this virus virus figured out we will have another virus to worry about </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Is it anybody responsible for the death of so many people in the last few weeks? Or is not such a thing as responsability.... only power to decide over other people's lives or death? </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> That's the question. 2200 new confirmed cases today. Looks like their turn is near. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> LET US START FROM  THIS QUESTION >>>>WHY DID NATIONAL INSTITUTE  OF HEALTH  (NIH)  IN THE UNITED STATES FUND  THE EXPERIMENT  THAT CREATED SARS COV 2 (COVID 12)  AT  THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA IN 2015.. </COMMENT 19>

<TIMESTAMP> 2020-05-13T15:53:10Z </TIMESTAMP>
<DESCRIPTION> America has the highest number of #COVID19 infections and deaths in the world. Why was its response to the global pandemic too late and too little? </DESCRIPTION>
<TAGS> ['CNA Insider', 'Channel NewsAsia', 'People stories', 'Asian perspectives'] </TAGS>
<COMMENT 1> The same way us Canadians got it so wrong,By deception.
China purposely withheld vital information while making a trade deal in bad faith with USA which included a "Deal can be cancelled in case of Act of God or pandemic" clause.
WHO assisted by insisting to all G7 countries that the social media reporting of the pandemic was fake news and there was no danger even though Wuhan locked down January 23.
For a comparison look at Canada's situation.If population is adjusted to match USA figures about 70,000 dead.
Trump,Canada's Trudeau, and Ex WHO member Canada's Dr. Tam reiterated these words and Trudeau even encouraged travel from China sick or not.
First confirmed case arrived in Canada Jan 25.Canada locked down March 18.
Watch Canada's health minister in late Febuary call it fake news during questions of "Canada is taking the WHO expert advice to not shut borders".
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3O1EBQXl6U&t=879s and at the time frame 11:40 where she says we are continuing to follow the expert advice of the WHO.

Taiwan warned WHO of a human to human transmission threat.WHO ignored Taiwan because WHO is a china puppet.
The proof of this is they will not recoganize Taiwan as anything but a part of China to avoid conflict with China.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlCYFh8U2xM          https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h43S34daX-U 

Is the WHO supposed to be political?Allegations are that a top WHO member's family accepted "help" from China.
Trump has discontinued to send the WHO $400 million a year.All G7 countries need to follow his lead.

It is time for the G7 countries to start our own version of the WHO and dump the incompetent or corrupt WHO.
They assisted China by withholding information to protect China's negotiating in bad faith trade deal by participating in an act of conspiracy to commit murder.
We as a society owe this to the families of all the murder victims. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Trump has smart people around him. He knows that. He just believes that he himself is more smart.

He isn’t. 

How do I deal with what he has done?? I will let you know after I go to the toilet. I gotta take a wicked trump. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> We're suppose to be hit the hardest yet the only place we really saw it is in New York. Many here dont take it seriously because we just aren't seeing it. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> This is war. Wake up! </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Who is suffering the worst----the politicians---the establishment---the poor----the rich!? Just asking! </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> It hit you before you knew it was </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> He blames every one, to deflect from his 12 yr.old mind </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> mask need </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Why singaporean news channel covering the failing of US president? Why don't u look at your own government first? Oh wait, u're too afraid to criticize Singapore government! hahaha... </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> American leaders is at fault but they put the blame to WHO and China! They acted to too late. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Spoiled Brat it is, . . . Too much liberty realy kills, . . . We have a saying, that all that is prohibited is addictive😂😂😂😂 " liberty" </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> New York Times are FAKE NEWS. They didn't report President Trump want to stop people coming in to USA but the Democrats ignored it. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> In Taiwan, the first case was detected early and President Tsai Ing-wen immediately consulted her team of top infectious disease experts and together, using what they learned from the SARS epidemic, they initiated a sophisticated program of banning flights from Wuhan, testing, tracking, tracing and isolation and, with the cooperation of the Taiwanese people, the dragon was slain!
     And what did Trump do with his OWN team of experts? 
     He disbanded them.
     Why?
     Because they'd been assembled by Barack Obama and he didn't like that. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Don't worry America. Malaysia will keep selling you medical gloves. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Like anything else from China be it trade , "war" or whatever.... trump think it's a walk in the park .....he is half right, but the park is where they're burying the dead (american) from covid-19, they now have to find places to bury black African American inflicted by the white supremacist police ! Pse don't give any advice on how Hong Kong should be rule ! </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> 😞😞😞 We have been following this pandemic since December, when the pandemic was still in China before it broke out into Europe. By which time the government and the people here, who has families in both Europe and China, started to get worried and probably (hopefully) started discussions and pre actions in order to try and get ahead of this before it could break out here. And since this pandemic started spreading over the Christmas, New Year and Chinese New Year period, where we witness the most heaviest travel period in the world, of course it is going to break out. If Trump’s acted sooner with The Playbook and had not cut funding for Infectious Diseases Control in Asia and had he not pulled out of the Paris Accords, which by the way including medicines and equipment buying and selling, And not taken down Obamacare, which might alleviate their constituents from paying too much  on hospital and doctors bills, I very highly doubt that you would have suffered such high casualties than you already have. Look at our country Australia and look at our casualty rates. Stark contrast to yours. Mr Trump I applaud you 👏👏 very well done sir 👍 Well done. This is your legacy. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> US values politics more than lives. So it's obvious its government urge people to die to save the workable. </COMMENT 17>

<COMMENT 5> I know two persons who recovered. They lost a great part of their lung capacity as if they had been smoking for years. Oximeter also indicates lower level of oxygen. I believe this could affect other organs in the long run leading to various diseases. I use a peak flow meter to monitor my lung function.

<COMMENT 12> F you, </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> The virus Germany figured out is way over blown? That virus?

Germany’s interior ministry:

Some of the report key passages are:

- The dangerousness of Covid-19 was overestimated: probably at no point did the danger posed by the new virus go beyond the normal level.

- The people who die from Corona are essentially those who would statistically die this year, because they have reached the end of their lives and their weakened bodies can no longer cope with any random everyday stress (including the approximately 150 viruses currently in circulation).

- Worldwide, within a quarter of a year, there has been no more than 250,000 deaths from Covid-19, compared to 1.5 million deaths [25,100 in Germany] during the influenza wave 2017/18.

- The danger is obviously no greater than that of many other viruses. There is no evidence that this was more than a false alarm.

- During the Corona crisis the State has proved itself as one of the biggest producers of Fake News.

The report focuses on the “manifold and heavy consequences of the Corona measures” and warns that these are “grave”.

More people are dying because of state-imposed Corona-measures than they are being killed by the virus.

You’ve been exposed WaPo. Stop pushing lies. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> A

Es ga </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Still do not know any friend, or even any friend of a friend, who has Covid.  I'm not currently living in a massively populated area, but I have friends and family in Los Angeles, Dallas, San Francisco and New York and none of them have either been infected or even knows of anyone--a friend or family member--who has been infected.  I just find it odd. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Man glad to see u beat this deadly virus I hope u are getting better every day!! I can't believe these people with the riots out here looting!! I live in Baltimore,Maryland where Freddy Gray was killed nobody else went to bat for that man know we have a national starting a protest at the worse possible time all these people that Virus could be spreading like wild fire that cop killed Floyd he will have his day in court!! But we have to think of the big picture Covid-19!! I am glad ur a survivor  👍👍!! </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> BS </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Glad he recovered now his hospital bill must be really nice </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Trump is the Antichrist and all his followers are marked by Satan. He used the Bible and God to display his superiority over protestors. Nations become beasts when they exalt their economic power and military superiority as God. As the eldest brother of my family I incarnate Jesus Christ, Michael the archangel, and Adam the first man. God and I will no longer tolerate this beast and his followers. God is in the process of humiliating Trump and his followers. I will teach all that all beings have free will. This is the end of the Antichrist and the beginning of a New Kingdom. </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 12> Vous êtes un numéro messieurs, dames (la série le prisonnier! ) </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> dimanche 5 Avril encore plus chaud , alors sortez , profitez du soleil   😝 </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Pour ce commentaire prenez un petit moment à lire 10 raisons suivantes !!! ( mes opinions personels) .

1) Si le virus vient vraiment des chauves souris et de marché d'animaux sauvages de  Wuhan (Chine)pourquoi ce virus vient juste d'apparaitre maintenant alors que le marché et bien sur les chauves souris existaient depuis longtemps avant meme que certaines personnes soient naitre 


2) Remarquez-vous ? Pourquoi le virus propage très vite dans les grands pays (pays de pouvoir ) comme (Chine, Japon ,France, Espagne,Italie ,Allemagne ou encore Etats Unis)

3) Les médias nous informent chaque jour les nombres de morts qui augmentent  comme pas possible et n'ont jamais diffusé les photos de ces cadavres (bien sur censurés je ne demande pas non plus de montrer tous les cadavres) la plupart des medias informent les informations sur le virus mais on voit que les images de docteurs,infirmierss etc qui ont été diffusé .Ok je ne dis pas le contraire car je crois aussi que le virus existe vraiment mais moins inquietant que les medias qui informent . Dans ce monde toutes les dix seconde une personne  meurt (accident etc) mais je suis sur qu' ils les comptent ensemble avec les personnes mortes  du virus que je trouve que ce n'est pas claire 


4) Depuis l'annoncement de confinement que nous devons rester a la maison et autoriser de nous déplacer dans les cas nécessaires ) juste pour arreter l'épidémie de virus mais pour l'instant je ne vois pas que le gouvernement fait quelques choses de plus ( Apart les policiers qui arretent les gens et leurs mettre les amende) mais bien sur que les medecins sont a la recherche de medicament qui pourrait faire contre ce virus.

5) Si vraiment le virus est contagieuse par les mains et la voie respiratoire ou  meme par les yeux et peut rester jusqu'a 6 heures dans l'air  je pense que personne ne pourrait s'échapper à cela meme les personnes qui portent les gants ou masques  ou qui reste a 5 metres de loin de l'un et l'autre car on respire de l'air (et que le virus est dans l'air et que l'on ne peut pas voir car il est pas en morceaux comme les kfc ) si vraiment le masque ferme et protege tres bien le virus  comment peut on respirer et avoir de l'oxygene. ? 


6)Pendant le confinement je pense qu'il y a encore les personne qui ont été contaminé par le virus mais qui ne se rendent pas compte donc si un jour la situation redevient  normale (ce que je souhaite) ces gens ressortent enfin et ils risquent de  contaminer aux autres alors et si c'est comme ca je pense que le virus ne prendra  jamain fin comme il n'y a pas assez de materiaux pour faire le teste )

7) Je pense que les chauves souris et les  pangolins ont très peut de 

role dans cette histoire  (c'est possible bien sur car ces animaux 
existaient depuis longtemps) meme s'ils les scientifiques disent qu'ils 
ont les souches simillaires que le virus et je pense que le marché de 
Wuhan ne les vendait pas ces animaux juste  un jour avant que le virus 
apparait.)

8Je pense que c'est plutot une erreur des scientifiques ( ce virus ont été crée par l'homme pour une raison que nous ne pourrons jamais savoir.Seuls les scientifiques et les gouvernements le savent ) surtout les  gouvernements beaucoup de chosee se cachent derriere.Il y a beaucoup de choses que nous ne savons pas et nous ne saurions jamais )meme les medias donnent certaines informations qui ne correspondent pas a la realité  et  contraires .
9) Je comprend que les medias ont une grande influent dans notre monde d'aujour d'hui (mais les medias sont comme les alcools et parfois  plus dangereux que les alcools car consommer de l'acool on devient accro et aussi mauvais pour la santé mais les medias nous rendent obsedes).il y a les conseils pour consommer les alcools c'est de comsommer avec moderation c'est aussi avec les médias c'est de regarder et analyser en meme temps et pas que écouter car meme les medias sont parfois pas honnetes .

10) Prendre soin de soit et faire attention a l'hygiene est quelque chose de bien et pas qu'en ce moment mais tous les moments de la vie mais en ce moment je vois que les gens sont plutot obsedés que peur ,A quel point on oublie que notre vie doit continuer.je pense qu'au lieu de mourir a cause de virus on va plutot  mourir car on a pas de quoi acheter a  manger .J'espere que la situation s'ameliora bientot et vous verrez bien que dans quelque mois les gouvernements  et les medias vont nous annoncer que le virus n'existe plus et plus personne n'est malade.C'est ce qui sera une surprise tres etonnante .Donc prenez soin de vous et restez chez vous pour ne pas payer les amende!!!!! </COMMENT 14>

<COMMENT 1> Cure or disease all created by God.. I’m not 
Jeffrey Harmon or Lisa Michelle Harmon 

The basic creation story is found in Genesis 1 and 2, with the account of what happened in the Garden of Eden in chapter 3. Genesis 1 begins before the existence of anything except God Himself. God’s revelation of Himself and His will for mankind is the beginning of the creation story. In this beginning, God created everything in the universe (Genesis 1:1). This includes all the heavenly bodies (including every star and planet), as well as everything on the earth. While the triune nature of God is not explicit in the Genesis account, God does reveal an “us” within the Godhead (Genesis 1:26). The Spirit is active in creation (Genesis 1:2) as is Christ (John 1:1–3; Colossians 1:15–17).

In the six days of creation, God formed light, the universe, and the earth (day 1); the sky and the atmosphere (day 2); dry land and all plant life (day 3); the stars and heavenly bodies, including the sun and moon (day 4); birds and water creatures (day 5); and all the land animals and man (day 6). Mankind is special above all other creatures because he bears the image of God (Genesis 1:27) and has the responsibility to steward and subdue the earth (verse 28). All of creation was completed in six days in all its vast array and wondrous beauty. God announced that His creation was “very good” (verse 31). Genesis 2 sees the ending of God’s creative work and gives a more detailed account of the creation of man.

The seventh day is marked by God’s resting. The rest does not suggest that God was tired; rather, His “rest” was simply a cessation of work. God was done, and the universe was just as He wanted it to be. God’s six days of work, followed by a day of no work, establishes a pattern of taking one day in seven for rest and sets the number of days in the week still in use today. The keeping of the Sabbath later became a distinguishing mark of God’s chosen people (Exodus 20:8–11.)

Genesis 2 takes a closer look at the creation of man. This passage is not a second creation account, nor is it contradictory to Genesis 1. Genesis 2 simply takes a step away from a linear report to refocus the reader on God’s unique work concerning man. God formed man from the dust of the earth He had previously created. After forming man’s body, God breathed life—a soul—into him. The fact that God chose to form man this way shows His great care in this process. God next placed the first man, Adam, in a special place, the Garden of Eden. Eden was beautiful and bountiful. Adam had almost everything he needed, including food and productive work. However, God was not done with man.

God helped Adam to see his need for a mate by having him review all the other creatures and naming them (Genesis 2:19–20). At the end of the naming process, Adam understood what he lacked. God caused Adam to sleep and then formed Eve with as much care as He had formed Adam (verses 21–22). Eve was made from Adam’s rib. When God brought Eve to Adam, the man immediately understood that she was special. She was his counterpart, his complement, and flesh of his flesh (verse 23).

God made both Adam and Eve in God’s image (Genesis 1:27). The Bible’s creation account establishes the family as the basic building block of society (Genesis 1:24; cf. Matthew 19:5–6). As a God-ordained institution, marriage is to be only between one man and one woman.

Adam and Eve were created in a state of innocence (Genesis 1:25) and had not committed any sin. They enjoyed communion with God in Eden and the freedom to eat of whatever trees of the garden they wished, except for one (Genesis 2:16–17). Part of their relationship with God was the inclusion of one simple rule: Adam and Eve were forbidden to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (Genesis 2:17).

At some point Eve was tempted by the serpent to eat from the forbidden tree, which she did. Adam also ate and joined his wife in disobedience (Genesis 3:1–6). When Adam and Eve sinned against God, they lost their innocence and their nature was corrupted (Genesis 3:7–12). Sin brought consequences. The process of death began immediately. God cursed the serpent to crawl forever on the ground and be hated by men (verses 14–15). God punished Eve to pain in childbirth and conflict with her husband (verse 16), and He punished Adam with toil and hardship in his labors (verses 17–19). And Adam and Eve were expelled from the Garden of Eden and denied access to the tree of life (Genesis 3:22–24).

In His great mercy, God also covered Adam and Eve’s shame (Genesis 3:21) and gave them a message of hope in the promise of a Redeemer. The Bible’s first mention of the coming Messiah is found in Genesis 3:15, often called the protoevangelium. The Seed of the woman would come to crush the head of the Serpent, at the cost of being bruised Himself. So, an integral part of the creation story is a prediction of Jesus’ death on the cross and His triumph over Satan and the curse.

<COMMENT 4> So sad </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Noch jemand mit irgendwelchen unnötigen Problemen hier? </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> my respects and heartfelt condolences . O pray theat her legacy and sacrifice her love and goodness will change me for good. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> This is just too sad🥺😭 </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Why exactly are there people disliking? Have they been crying too much over people with it? Hate it? Paranoid of it? Why would they dislike? </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> I'm sorry for the loss to her family and all those she's helped and could have helped in the future. That said, observe her weight. That raises the question did she take care of herself? I see zero mention of additional vitamin C, vitamin D, zinc or any kind of good diet. I have no doubt she was a wonderful woman. I do believe she was brainwashed by a standard medical instruction. It truly is up to each of us to take care of our own immune system. Maybe we have to be seen as a bit selfish and take care of ourselves, so we can take care of others for a longer period of time. May she rest in peace. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Hai Gail King 😒 </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> LIARS! </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> But continue going out to f'ing beaches, eating junk food in restaurants, and going to malls to buy sh** you don't need with money you don't have because you need other people to entertain you.  Continue thinking this is a joke and don't wear masks or gloves while your fat pig president golfs.  Hope you're enjoying the party, America.  🖕 </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Well she looks old and obese. She probably could have died from a regular flue also. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Rest In Peace </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Covid19 eventually shuts you down with pneumonia --- asphyxiation. Your lungs just shut down. And yet many people during phase 3 are walking around without face masks....

I just wonder if we're in for another mutated outbreak. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> This is far too tragic and for the people making comments that covid19 is fake makes it disturbing </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> As a single mother, I pray that her son’s will be okay, how traumatic </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> My utmost respect for all the doctors and nurses who have died as heroes trying to save people's lives from the coronavirus. In my heart, I offered them a 21 gun salute. </COMMENT 18>

<COMMENT 7> Sooo.. the way he is debunking is by Googling "expert in my area" and randomly asking their opinion on each thing? Lol that is not investigative journalism, it just shows that you value people with traditional education and dismiss those who are coming to their own conclusions independently. I don't know if any of this stuff is true, but it's also not being debunked in any impressive way. People think that if you hold a specific position in society like doctor, that you are an infallible god. Doctors used to bloodlet people, and everyone insisted that was correct too. We do not have anywhere near a healthy level of skepticism of those who are in positions of control. </COMMENT 7>

<COMMENT 2> It's altering the immune system those are the same symptoms my wife has while taking Brentuximab Vedotin a immunotherapy containing cytotoxin. A very strong and sometimes lethal compound that destroys cancer and tumors. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> One case currently in Austin, Texas. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> My brother had kawasaki when he was a baby, it was so bad that his immune system got as weak as someone’s with VIH... sadly, his symptoms only arise whenever he lives through some type of “hormonal growth”. It gets more dangerous every time 😓 </COMMENT 4>

<COMMENT 7> if these kids start showing signs of superpowers, then the guerrilla marketing campaign for the next X-Men movie has gone a *little* too far... </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> anything new on possibility of reinfection or big mutation ? </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Remember back in Early February SciShow said Wuhan Virus(Known as that back than) is not that bad(just flu lol) and would never cause a worldwide pandemic? I do but you cannot because they deleted that video. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Sounds vary simaler to proriasis arthritis. An autoimmune disease caused by an over active immune system, could be that it is one and the same and this is the early signs triggered by a severe infection of a larger problem. Most of the cases of proriasis arthritis don't get noticed or diagnosed till the disease is much farther along. With mild seemingly non-damaging symptoms in young other wise healthy people doctors tend to ignore problems as almost a reverse gamblers fallacy "they can't have the rare condition that is so unlikely" </COMMENT 10>

<COMMENT 12> This is great thanks </COMMENT 12>

<COMMENT 14> Could we have a video on Sky Quakes? A weird roar in the sky sometimes during thunder storms and sounds kind of like a sonic boom but over and over again. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Hey guys, I've been seeing articles being shared around social media claiming that covid-19 is not a virus but a bacterium that causes thrombosis, obviously my first instinct is to not believe these claims but it might be a good topic for a myth busting video and I'd love to hear your position! </COMMENT 15>

Covid19 actually started at the Military World Game in Wuhan in October 2019 brought by the American Contingent.
Many Americans hv died of this virus in America before they have even reached Wuhan prior to the game.
The American wants to hide this fact from the world and instead blame China. </COMMENT 2>

It was released when Trump forcibly removed the Sioux tribal nations to dig the Dakota Access Pipeline in order to personally benefit from his stock in Phillips 66 Co.

<COMMENT 4> wouldn't count on wuhan "health" org to do smth relevant nor actually protective PPE from its master in ccp land </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Workers in medical field die from cancer every day.  Thats a fact! </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> People need to start specifying that it’s doctors working only in state hospitals. Because doctors with private practice are some of the last professionals that can enrich themselves (along with financiers, politicians, politician’s friends and Hollywood actors I guess). In my country many state hospital doctors have also a private practice and manipulate the system to make even more money. Nurses are a whole different story but all the reporting puts them in the same group while we all know how money hungry most medical doctors are. </COMMENT 6>

<COMMENT 12> This pandemic proves all people should have a Guaranteed Residual Income, from the day of of birth, because no one has an income for a very long time. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> So many troll comments </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> I think we should eliminate the current education system... and start teaching every person science and medicine because that’s important information... and what schools now teach is mostly useless. They now spend years repeating the same useless things, like force kids to read books and give book reports, etc. Once a person learns to read , which for most people would take literally 1-2  months, they should start learning whatever things people already in those fields know what is most important. Right? Then there’d be no doctor shortage. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Greece has no death from healthcare workers, only a few got the virus. Well done to my fellow people. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> I anyone deserves a quick and painful termination, it's Putin. The problem: When (not if) he is terminated, will the creep taking over be any better? Given the atrocious luck of the Russian people when it comes to "leaders", he will be even worse (please note the HE part, the Russians will not be so lucky to get a Babushka as a leader, even if that would solve all their problems in one fell swoop)! John Lennon lamented the atrocious luck of the Irish but we in the West should really lament the horrible misfortune of the Russians. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> I don't think that it's necessarily about the virus but the donning & doffing of PPE. Here in FL they found 70% of the time medical staff was self contaminating. As an MA what they were called their MA's in Russia is very insulting. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Congratulations President Tsai, on fighting the Wuhan Virus. 🇹🇼 </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Clearly  Belgium has the most correct reporting.  And even that number is probably and underestimate. So death rate is around 1% </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 1> Ça leur à pas réussi en tout cas </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> En même temps, c'est un pays déjà bien avancé sur le télétravail donc en temps normal, y'a pas grand monde dans les rues en journée. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Anders Tegnell l'épidémiologiste suédois qui a défini la politique suédoise vis à vis de cettte pandémie vient de déclarer que c'était une erreur (voir son interview sur @t et bloomberg). 
En fait quand on regarde les statistiques La Suède qui était très en retard sur nous dans l'épidémie vient de nous rattraper en terme de mortalité/population. Ce qui est plus inquiétant que les chiffres bruts qui sont à prendre avec des pincettes, c'est la dynamique de l'épidémie. Alors que les courbes chez nous montrent une décrue très nette, là bas le nombre de nouveaux cas et le nombre de morts sont toujours très élevés et la pandémie ne faiblit pas. Les prochaines semaines vont être très compliquées en Suède. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Des gens qui pensent (de tous âges !) et qui s'expriment librement Waouh ca fait drôle. Qui sont posés, qui sont calmes en étant éveillés, épanouis...De là où je suis en France, je me prends à rêver... </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Merciiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii ! Et oui la différence a sa place  ! Et ca fait tellement du bien de mesurer à quel point l'éveil se lit sur les visages ! </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> La Swede a bien choisi..et le resultat il est la.. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Bien entendu on isole complètement les groupes à haut risques mais selon ce que j'ai compris plus vite la population non susceptible est infectée sans symptômes, plus vite on atteindra le niveau d'immunisation collective qui rendra la propagation du virus de plus en plus difficile et éventuellement impossible donc plus de cas au début mais sur une plus courte période et surtout PAS DE BATTAGE MEDIATIQUE DEMESURE, PAS DE PANIQUE de la population mais une information constante et juste et une incitation à agir de façon responsable.
D'accord, la théorie est très intéressante mais ce qui compte le plus ici c'est que grace à la Suède on pourra enfin confirmer si oui ou non les mesures de confinement imposées ailleurs auront été vraiment efficaces, si on nous a menti consciemment et intentionnellement ou si personne ne savait quoi faire, si on peut encore faire confiance aux gouvernements, aux médias et aux professionnels de la santé, etc... Finalement, que l'appoche Suédoise réussisse ou pas, la population mondiale saura quoi faire et les gouvernements quoi ne pas faire alors MERCI LA SUÈDE, fe tout coeur. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Criminel..renvoyer chez eux des patients atteints et leur demander de revenir directement aux soins intensifs! </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Même si les français étaient autant disciplinés, ça ne pourrait pas marcher. Puis, franchement si on regarde les chiffres comme il faut, c’est plutôt mauvais la situation en Suède ! Ils ont presque autant de morts par habitant que la France. Leur densité de population est 4 fois moins elevée qu’en France. Leur plus grande ville Stockholm a une taille comprise entre la ville de Lyon et de Toulouse. La France accueille près de 90 millions de touristes par an alors que la Suede n’en a que 7. De plus, la France est une grande puissance économique par rapport à la Suède, donc les flux migratoires sont bien plus élevés en France. Ça accélère donc la propagation du virus. Les bons élèves sont pas en Europe mais en Asie (Je parle de la Chine bien sur) ! </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> La Suede et un pays neutre qui connaitra jamais aucune crise, la Suede c'est 1000 fois mieux que la France. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Je suis heureuse de voir que au moins une nation europeene ne rentre pas danz l histerie comuniste de controle.des libertes individuelles. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> C'est vrai que l'organisation sanitaire a l'air performant en période normale et répond sereinement au nb de nouveaux cas de cette pandémie. Mais on voit qu'au fil des semaines, les habitants réalisent petit à petit la gravité de la situation et que les mesures sociétales sont plus fermes. Je suis étonnée par l'absence de consignes de port de masques dans des endroits où le respect de la distanciation physique de plus de 1 m pendant moins de 15 min est quasi impossible. En fin de pandémie de niveau 3, on fera les comptes non seulement par millions d'habitants mais par densité de population dans les grandes villes, en nb d'hospitalisés et en nb de morts par la Covid-19, de mortalité supplémentaire, en milieu de soins hospitaliers, cliniques et équivalents des EPHAD, En espérant que les pays joueront la transparence, au moins en Europe...ce serait bien que la jolie grand-mère garde sa joie, elle est trop mignonne. Au final, un confinement comme celui demandé en France ou ailleurs n'aurait peut-être pas été plus efficace sur l'impact des soins si le fonctionnement de base est bon ( assez de personnels, assez de lits et assez de moyens) en regard d'un pays peu peuplé et de densité populationelle relativement faible </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> permettez ; un grand merci à arte regards, toujours juste, toujours argumenté , toujours clair. J'ai souvenir aussi d'un reportage sur les démineurs en Irak (armés souvent de leur seul couteau pour appréhender le smines artisanales )  et en bosnie ... remarquable. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> c'est dingue de constater là encore que les pays du Nord de l'europe, les pays royalistes ont un ofnctionnemeent général bien plus proche de la démocratie (sur le fond) comparativement à  notre démocratie de forme qui a été vidée de toute substance par cet actuel gouvernement d'imposteurs. d'ailleurs ils nous méprisent. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> trop de chance en France on nous a enfermés c'est ridicule nous allons avoir pleins de problèmes psycholiques........... </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> J'habite en Suisse et nous avons fait pareil l'état ne nous a pas obligé ils nous on recommandé du coup la population a geave bien jouer le jeu. Je sortais j'allais au parc avec ma fille mes amis tranquille. Moi j'ai fuir  infopendemie ou le journalisme de spectacle. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Ils ont l'air bien arrogants, pourtant ils sont même pas foutu de mettre un masque apparemment. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> 13:36 bravo! </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Mais c'est normal que la suède bénéficie d'un traitement de faveur. Elle en déjà au point où l'on veut nous faire parvenir. Ils sont de culture luthérienne comme dit ici, disciplinés, suivent les consignes, s'auto surveillent, il acceptent même la puce RFID sans problème Bref, le modèle à suivre préconisé par Attali et consorts </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 6> Ok, so why are gov's telling the wider population to use non N95 masks which DO NOT protect against Aerosol infection. Ok, I guess it does stop droplets and reduce the overall amount of infection leaving someone through their breath... but it does not stop the infection as a whole. We don't know if it is stil infective in its Aerosol form, which is the form that exits through non-N95 masks, so we're just guessing. What's the point if we're going to still spread the infection about in Aerosol form? Do we have evidence that the amount of virus is less in Aerosol form than droplet form, or vice versa? And with masks we're still adjusting it on our face, touching the infected droplet areas and pushing the virus around. How can it be justified that non-N95 masks work or are even benefical!? </COMMENT 6>

<COMMENT 14> Wow. Or he is mostly wrong.  It is the PPE combined with physical mental and emotional exhaustion from 12+ hour shifts surrounded by an incredible amount of electromagnetic radiation without access to fresh air and sunlight in an atmosphere of complete and total fear, along with a poor diet that is causing the high rate of sickness in healthcare workers. At one point General Practitioners in the US had an average life expectancy of 58 years when for the general population it was around 70 years.  Modern medicine is just that modern ie. inexperienced and unproven.  You would never seek out a healthcare provider who was fresh out of school or residency.   Instead a reasonable person would seek out someone who had 10, 15, or even 20 years of experience.  We have been brainwashed into thinking modern medicine that is only a couple hundred years old has all the answers when traditional medicines with thousands of years of proven success are being marginalized as complimentary.  Don't forget how many things modern medicine has gotten wrong.  Smoking, cholesterol along with all the withdrawn drugs and vaccines that have killed so many people needlessly because pharmaceutical corporations hospitals and doctors just wanted to make a profit.  Research Claude Bernard and Antoine Bechamp and terrain theory.  Even Louis Pasteur admitted that his germ theory was incorrect.  If you are healthy take off your mask, get exposed so that you develop natural immunity and we will all eventually benefit from herd immunity.  Wake up! Rise up! </COMMENT 14>

Also  the masks you are panicking people about actually concentrate the virus for those heath care workers.     Ex;  Patient coughs,  Virus enters Nurses airway via  air flow around the mask.  The next time the nurse exhales ( about 14 to 16 times per minute average),  She retains some of the virus in the mask.  The mask to some degree is  a REBREATHER  MASK.  There are videos out there that you can watch,  or in the case of "Masks and the Rebreather effect",  they did cover that at my university. </COMMENT 15>

The 2nd wave co2 rebreathing

So okay, there's no proof that it works, but it can't hurt, right? WRONG.

Now that we have established that there is no scientific evidence necessitating the wearing of a face mask for prevention, are there dangers to wearing a face mask, especially for long periods? Several studies have indeed found significant problems with wearing such a mask. This can vary from headaches, to increased airway resistance, carbon dioxide accumulation, to hypoxia, all the way to serious life-threatening complications....While most agree that the N95 mask can cause significant hypoxia and hypercapnia, another study of surgical masks found significant reductions in blood oxygen as well....The importance of these findings is that a drop in oxygen levels (hypoxia) is associated with an impairment in immunity. Studies have shown that hypoxia can inhibit the type of main immune cells used to fight viral infections... This sets the stage for contracting any infection, including COVID-19 and making the consequences of that infection much graver. In essence, your mask may very well put you at an increased risk of infections and if so, having a much worse outcome.

Read that carefully. No known scientific evidence that face masks will prevent transmission... but there is scientific evidence that wearing masks can cause harm. The dangers of carbon dioxide poisoning was discussed in the Dr. Judy Mikovits thread (here). He also confirms what I have been told about someone who is sick will re-inhale their own expelled virus cells, constantly re-infecting themselves, which increases their viral load and increases the risk of serious complications.

There is another danger to wearing these masks on a daily basis, especially if worn for several hours. When a person is infected with a respiratory virus, they will expel some of the virus with each breath. If they are wearing a mask, especially an N95 mask or other tightly fitting mask, they will be constantly rebreathing the viruses, raising the concentration of the virus in the lungs and the nasal passages. We know that people who have the worst reactions to the coronavirus have the highest concentrations of the virus early on. And this leads to the deadly cytokine storm in a selected number.

It gets even more frightening. Newer evidence suggests that in some cases the virus can enter the brain. In most instances it enters the brain by way of the olfactory nerves (smell nerves), which connect directly with the area of the brain dealing with recent memory and memory consolidation. By wearing a mask, the exhaled viruses will not be able to escape and will concentrate in the nasal passages, enter the olfactory nerves and travel into the brain.

Sounds like a recipe for disaster and exactly the opposite of what we should be doing. And who will be hurt most again?

Unfortunately, no one is telling the frail elderly and those with lung diseases, such as COPD, emphysema or pulmonary fibrosis, of these dangers when wearing a facial mask of any kind—which can cause a severe worsening of lung function. This also includes lung cancer patients and people having had lung surgery, especially with partial resection or even the removal of a whole lung.

One could be forgiven for thinking this is a better plan for culling the herd than for herd immunity. Hmmmmm.....

Knowledge is power. Please think carefully about how and when to wear a mask, and especially for how long. Face masks pose risks for everyone wearing them -- the healthy and the sick -- and provide little if any protection for anyone. </COMMENT 20>

Don’t destroy your reputation by subscribing to this mess. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> The problem is that this is med tech. There are regulations here for a reason. 
The "vacuum cleaner mask" thing is dangerous because there are studies showing users are exposed to the inhalation of glass like fragments that can go on to cause lung cancer in the long run. Hundreds of thousands of people have probably gone on to do this after it went viral. We won't even know for a decade or two. 

A lot of these things can't hurt. But it's very important to test these things
I'm a founder of a med tech company - caroundyou.com - and though i agree that a lot of these things are arbitrary, it's better we get this right than not in cases where there's potential for harm at the very least. </COMMENT 6>

<COMMENT 1> 12:00 What about the dangers of ventilators? Death by ventilators is a VERY real and common occurrence! Treatment with hydroxychloroquine with as-reported-by-doctors-in-the-field 99% efficacy ELIMINATES the need to go on a ventilator.
Government NIH statistics in quote and link.
MSM media never points out the following statistics for some reason! Don't you find that odd? if our plague managers are really concerned with our health why do they carry on about "ventilators! ventilators!"? One might assume that MSM and especially NY Governor Cuomo WANT people to die given the high frequency of death by Ventilator Associated Pneumonia.
"Ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in intensive care units. The incidence of VAP varies from 7% to 70% in different studies and the mortality rates are 20–75%"
https://tinyurl.com/y8qlokfb </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Dr. Scheult should be called as a witness. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> How do you submit a question </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Could vitamin E and Omega 3 help as an anti coagulant? </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Wow that was an Awesome video!!!!  Thank you so much for your positive contributions </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Thank you for another excellent Medcram update.  I look forward to the next update as we move forward with this pandemic! </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> I'm not a medical professional, but I watch your videos on you tube. Very informative. Thank you. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Dr Seheult impressive communication capacity. Your doing a good job. You will be very famous soon . Good luck </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Dr Seheult, respect to steroids, in Brazil most of hospitals are using hidrocortisone as anti inflammatory. What do you think about it? </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Is it ok to take Acetylcysteine Effervescent tabs everyday? And It's hard to find vitamin D here in my country for affordable price, so does  getting sunlight in the morning at my terrace will do the same thing as taking vitamin d supp?

I have Covid-19 with mild symptoms. And at home quarantine. 

Thanks for the answers and concerns. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> DrSehault, Where do you have time to update....while you are so busy? </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Interviewer is superb...to the point </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> God bless DrSehault 😊 </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Amazing....during this crisis people focusing on research also...God bless the researchers 🙏 </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Very useful and informative 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> As Dr. Seheult talks about having his Vitamin D level checked - please make sure to STOP taking Vitamin D supplements AT LEAST 3 DAYS before having a blood sample taken. Otherwise the determined values are not realistic (actual values can be much lower). </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> We sweap it under the rag same as HIV. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Would you care to share your thoughts on what I believe to be the Solution to COVID-19 --here's the link to my video: https://youtu.be/WSBVpGjyP8k </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Thank you. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Dr Seheult should know that instead of swallowing vitamin D pills it's best to get vitamin D from foods like cod liver, sardines, salmon, herrings, and  butter made from the milk of grass-fed cows.  And sunshine of course. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 1> How on earth can a few folk down vote this? We live in a strange world inhabited by a % of very strange folk. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Is there any data on who or where people are getting Covid from now, ie a supermarket, public transport, a particular workplace, hospitals of course as well as workplaces. This would be really helpful to know. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> I have been using the App for a few weeks and report daily, also there are daily updates on the research. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> A valuable briefing that has advanced my family's understanding of the virus. With the real possibility of no vaccine by the end of the year we can and will be prepared for a long term return to the new 'normality' of life with the risk of C19 ever present. Thank you so very much for your hard work, analysis and findings.  We are indebted to your team. </COMMENT 4>

<COMMENT 9> Thank you so much for your clear, coherent explanation. Thanks for enabling ordinary folk to help you help us all to combat coronavirus. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Thank you for this update, really useful and interesting to hear an independent view point </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Thank you for sharing it. Yes what about the actual workers or even cleaners. How they can be tested? </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> It would be great to see a 5min summary video of this/similar videos </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Thank you for such valuable work. Please keep it up, and let's hope the politicians take it seriously. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Good luck with your research </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> I wish there was more information regarding local areas. Our local testing centre has been closed this week - is this because we have very few people with symptoms? </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Why doesn’t the Government recommend downloading the app if they don’t have an alternative?? </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Very interesting.Great to hear information direct from a scientific group that is  pragmatic and willing to give a non-political perspective. l will be listening again! </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Why is nobody advising vitamin D for black and asian people, as the darker the skin, the less able they are to make it from sunlight? It is essential for a strong immune system. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Webinars are always so informative and interesting, thank you as always for giving your time and researching Covid 19 so expertly. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Excellent details, thanks...but the slides are really hard/impossible to see on my phone. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 16> Racism is just an excuse to justify beating on someone because they're different from you. 

Racist just want to hurt people and think it's justified if their victim is different in ethnicity, skin color, or physical stature. 

I've seen a few racists beat on different ethnicities and most of the time the victim appeared physically weaker or smaller than their assailant(s) and it always appears to be cowardice bullying especially when it's a group attacking one person.

Racism is truly worse than covid-19 </COMMENT 16>

<COMMENT 1> What are your questions regarding the coronavirus pandemic? #askDerrick </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> How can people think it is healthy to wear a mask for 9 hours a day at work. By the end if the day i have such a headache and very sticky phlegm to the point i would not know if i was sick. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Great information. Thank you so much for your message </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Recommend a mask manufacturer, price: 0.14 USD / PCS, and only 7 USD for 50 PCS!! FDA test passed, which registration serial number is 10062936. You could check it on the FDA website, it’s OK for medical or surgical usage. Contact email: stephenyaftersale@foxmail.com or website: www.superyouke.com.

I did some deep investigation and all the information from this supplier was in line with my requirements. This is the first face mask manufacturer that has truly passed all tests and is willing to provide the original certificates since I have bought so many masks from different sellers on Amazon, who were either too expensive or too bad quality.

I ordered 50,000pcs and contacted the local UPS for delivery. It only took a week to my place at STOCKTON, CA and my tracking number is 1Z5586Y20466890012.

The reason I ordered this big amount of face masks is that we do have urgent need for this. I have raised its price a little and made a little money for my spent time and energy. Hope this information can help out. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> So the goverment is ok to hand out furloughs all over the place but dont have enough money to give a face mask and gloves to every man woman and child on the planet.  They seem to know where we all live why not pop a reusable mask and gloves in a jiffy bag and pop it in the post. Wat does it cost   prolly less than the billions that's already went out the door </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> How the heck are we going to get sick ie develop immunity if were trying to avoid etting sick in the first place?? And wh y are we refering to getting the flu as a security threat????? What happened to natural existence and nature doing its thing? This is bias beyond repair. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> U can try </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> It doesn't </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> It's ez 4 an introvert 2 stay home but 4 an extrovert it's hard cuz they get their energy by being around ppl n it's hard 4 an extrovert 2 social distance but ez 4 an introvert 2 social distance </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> THE ONLY THING YOU SHOULD KNOW IS THERES AN AGENDA BEHIND THIS...PEOPLE WHO WALK AROUND WITH THE MASK ARE SLAVES TO THE SYSTEM! </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Lol and now we have the protests risking a huge Corona virus transmission and growth </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> emergensupply.com are best masks supplier in US, mine arrived in 2 days ! </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> The fact mask cause co2 poison that weakings your immune system and could be proven deadly with long use. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> How about a theory that 5G radio waves actually kill the virus?
This might help explain why younger people are less affected, as they are always on their cellphones.....? </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Does somebody know if there are masks that can be reused, and how? I can't afford to buy too many masks, and I still have to go to work.. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Masks are trash. Annoying as heck to wear it for all day. People.who say masks are awesome dont even wear them 6 hours a day. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> These so called experts from W.H.O. and C.D.C.(USA)should be executed !  I lost my mom because of their idiotic advice that all you got to do is wash your hands real good. This is not something new. All these so called experts should know about Bird flu and SARS. How did the Asian countries fight those contagions back then and now Covid-19. PUT YOUR FACE MASKS ON AND WASH YOUR HANDS !  I live in New York City. Over 20,000 dead and counting and they are still debating if wearing face masks helps. I want the names of these experts. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Wearing a mask for a long time..you rebreathe your own air.. and co2. It can make yr levels of co2  go up and you can  become hypoxic..a lack of oxygen. The effects are dizziness, shortness of breath, light headedness, anxiety and stress due to over compensating to breathe, which in turn lowers your immunity.
Building up your natural immunity, through good nutrition, vitamins, exercise, has proved to be useful and effective </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> If you wear a mask in Chicago will that protect you from getting shot and killed? </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Professor with all do respect I disagree. Pore size of the fabric mask can be expressed by Poisseuilee’s law.  Everage is :118-1111 micron. The coronavirus average diameter is 0.125 micron.  Do the math. </COMMENT 20>

You are falling into a trap and the best part is is that you don’t believe that it’s more than a vaccine, it’s too crazy, illegal, or illogical. Maybe, it’s not scientific enough for you.

<COMMENT 8> Hello, sir.

Let me introduce myself, I'm Ferry, from Bogor, Indonesia.

Just sharing info. That in Indonesia, our small team, named Milagros, has given milagros water donations to hospitals that treat positive patients.

And the result, just by drinking Milagros water, recovery from covid19, is very perfect.

In our data, it has been noted that Milagros water is able to fight covid19. Also other health problems.

What I'm focusing on is that in Indonesia there is no need for a vaccine. We just take Milagros, corona can be overcome.

Right now, what your country does not have, but in my country is very abundant, is Milagros water.

Which is clearly proven to be able to cure positive patients covid19 to completion.

And it's proven, some of our small teams don't need an anti-covid vaccine. Just drinking milagros, it's resolved.

If you want to know more about Milagros water, you can contact my Whatsapp number at +6285925081694 </COMMENT 8>

<COMMENT 1> 12:00 What about the dangers of ventilators? Death by ventilators is a VERY real and common occurrence! Treatment with hydroxychloroquine with as-reported-by-doctors-in-the-field 99% efficacy ELIMINATES the need to go on a ventilator.
Government NIH statistics in quote and link.
MSM media never points out the following statistics for some reason! Don't you find that odd? if our plague managers are really concerned with our health why do they carry on about "ventilators! ventilators!"? One might assume that MSM and especially NY Governor Cuomo WANT people to die given the high frequency of death by Ventilator Associated Pneumonia.
"Ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in intensive care units. The incidence of VAP varies from 7% to 70% in different studies and the mortality rates are 20–75%"

<COMMENT 2> Dr. Scheult should be called as a witness. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> How do you submit a question </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Could vitamin E and Omega 3 help as an anti coagulant? </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Wow that was an Awesome video!!!!  Thank you so much for your positive contributions </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Thank you for another excellent Medcram update.  I look forward to the next update as we move forward with this pandemic! </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> I'm not a medical professional, but I watch your videos on you tube. Very informative. Thank you. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Dr Seheult impressive communication capacity. Your doing a good job. You will be very famous soon . Good luck </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Dr Seheult, respect to steroids, in Brazil most of hospitals are using hidrocortisone as anti inflammatory. What do you think about it? </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Is it ok to take Acetylcysteine Effervescent tabs everyday? And It's hard to find vitamin D here in my country for affordable price, so does  getting sunlight in the morning at my terrace will do the same thing as taking vitamin d supp?

I have Covid-19 with mild symptoms. And at home quarantine. 

Thanks for the answers and concerns. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> DrSehault, Where do you have time to update....while you are so busy? </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Interviewer is superb...to the point </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> God bless DrSehault 😊 </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Amazing....during this crisis people focusing on research also...God bless the researchers 🙏 </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Very useful and informative 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> As Dr. Seheult talks about having his Vitamin D level checked - please make sure to STOP taking Vitamin D supplements AT LEAST 3 DAYS before having a blood sample taken. Otherwise the determined values are not realistic (actual values can be much lower). </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> We sweap it under the rag same as HIV. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Would you care to share your thoughts on what I believe to be the Solution to COVID-19 --here's the link to my video: https://youtu.be/WSBVpGjyP8k </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Thank you. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Dr Seheult should know that instead of swallowing vitamin D pills it's best to get vitamin D from foods like cod liver, sardines, salmon, herrings, and  butter made from the milk of grass-fed cows.  And sunshine of course. </COMMENT 20>

en plus je dis ça je dis rien , je suis simple citoyen mais selon moi cela pourrait sauver plus de vies en centralisant les cas covid d'europe, rapatriement sanitaire en accord (via l'armée ) avec les autres pays d'europe, non? Avec du personnel européen, une europe unie et plus forte que jamais ! ça peut même vous servir lors des prochaines élections ( si c'est ce qui vous importe ) . Comme j'ai déjà dis je suis juste un citoyen lamda mais je pense que ça peut être extrêmement bénéfique pour tous le peuple européen . J'attends une réponse de qui de droit , merci. Mais n'oubliez pas, nous sommes en crise ,une crise violente, meurtrière, mondiale ! Et j'ai d'autres idées pour l'économie selon moi première esquisse ( et oui j'ai pas de chiffres ) mais bonnes à entendre.

<COMMENT 18> As I know someone that is being shielded, this makes me so upset. 12 weeks of being alone, they can’t see their family, they can’t leave their house. They have no back garden and hardly any internet. They’ve become prisoners during this for 3 months. Finally with some light at the end of the tunnel, selfish people have snatched that away. Not even just protestors, but people flocking to beaches, people inviting others over to their house. 
Some people forget that there are others that are suffering heavily too, but internet clout is more important </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Agree with the protests but better ways to go about it....like online.... considering the epidemic. I already know someone lost to coronavirus so yes it's real. :/ Please don't put all the NHS's hard work over the past few months to keep US safe to waste. Protect your family. </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 2> I want to take issue with the government saying don't use surgical masks, save them for the doctors. If only health professionals are using these things, there will only be a small demand. But if everybody starts using them, there will be a high demand, and the production of these items will rise respectively. Production would rise with demand. So no don't save these for the professionals, I want everybody to use them. Or am I wrong </COMMENT 2>

<COMMENT 4> NEED TO PROTECT THE HAIR AS WELL </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Please share to protect society as there is no vaccine to protect the public from Irwin Mitchell or Begbies Traynor Group PLC dishonest infestations. https://youtu.be/oGIIG-VljM4 </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> no more protective the hair. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Can you please put up a video on the kind of PPE that is required when healthcare workers are trying to prevent the PATIENT from getting COVID 19? As is the situation in MANY nursing homes. These nursing home patients are always there, right? Especially now during shelter in place, so we KNOW that EVERY COVID 19 case that occurs is most likley going to be from NURSES and other staff that are going INTO the nursing homes, right? SO show what is BEST for THEM to wear to protect non ill patients from an asymptomatic nurse or healthcare staff attending to THEM. Our most vulnerable population, right? Why aren't we discussing the threats to vulnerable eldelry and disabled in nursing homes and group homes from OUTSIDE staff? What should THEY be doing? As in, are they disinfecting their cell phones, Ipads, etc..when they come to work in these nursing homes and group homes? Are they adhering to infection control measures? Are there temperature checks for nurses and all nursing home and group home staff BEFORE they enter the facility? </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> apparently this was produced in association with the HSE !!   Scary or what ! </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> I think the PPE is incomplete.  It does not cover the hair/head and the neck is exposed. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> not sure if they'll deliver within a few weeks, but i pulled the trigger to get some masks here www.kn95masksdirect.com hopefully they'll come, worth the risk at this point imo </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> How do you 'adjust the head bones'?! at 4.57 on the video </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> PPE video like no other https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmLEqVSP7jM&t=2s </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Should not the person be wearing a cap to prevent virus from settling on her head?? Not shown in the DEMO </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> This is not good enough to protect the NHS. And where is her head cover, shoe covers amongst other things?

My full hazmat suit, N95 respirator, goggles, face shield, gloves, shoe covers, are what I use when I go out to buy food and get meds. Bought it ages ago in case of something like this! 🤦🏾‍♀️ </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> PHE, Do you have any comment on the suspicious "anomalies" regarding the statistics issued by PHE on the Total UK COVID-19 Cases Update page? </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Why is the PPE component in HS is different from Clinical when they are dealing with the same contagious COVID19? aerosol or non-aerosol they are still contagious. The symptoms are clear coughing and fever so the room of the patient is full of virus. It can still stick to any part of the uncovered part. It only takes a single virus to reproduce millions once it is inside of you. In Wuhan China, the doctors and the nurses were not allowed to go home to their families as they are the exposed and treating people that are infected they have an apartment where they come home together. They were only sent home after they have treated all the people that are infected. In the UK I don't know if its the same procedure but by looking at the difference between the PPE of Health and Social and Clinical while dealing with the same contagious COVID19 it doesn't seem right. What is the point social distancing, self-isolation and indifference of PPE components of different health organization? All I can say is this must have to do about money because of this PPE is expensive these days and also limited as most of them are supplied from CHINA and also they are single-use so how much PPE do you have to use every time just to protect yourself from the virus. The best PPE is head to toe coverage and also nurses also can spread the virus as they are most exposed to different folks as they go to care homes and hospital and also those people that are asymptomatic. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> I work in care we have confirmed cases but we were only given masks last week we have not been showing how to use them properly and we don't have bims just carrier bags in corridors open </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> I ordered my own 3M ffp3 mask I’ve spend hundreds for 
I first researched in January I was put off purchasing my own I’m really sorry I did not purchase them then they were really cheap now they are very expensive to get a box of five cost £100 </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> I Am a qualified nurse work in nursing homes specialist dementia unit 65 bed my manager sent me a letter last week to say that we are not allowed to wear masks we are only allowed to wear gloves and aprons yet we are involved in personal care and nursing interventions where it is impossible to implement Social guidelines of keeping two metres  away from residents </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> This protective equipment is a waste of time the nurses and Doctors need full body suits with enclosed head gear using filtered air supply as used in the manufacture of medication they might as well be naked . </COMMENT 20>

Kam vor ein paar Wochen erst bei einer Routine Untersuchung heraus, dass ich Antikörper im Blut habe. Und ich bin ja wohl der Protoyp für einen, der am Beatmungsgerät endet. 58 Jahre, Raucher, Trinker, 5 Stences und Mann. Es war nichts. Bissl Husten wie immer.

<COMMENT 2> Goodbye America. Your existence is but a spark in human history, a slightly brighter one tho </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Very good, but no Americans follow. We will see what will happen </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> The survival of the fittest is how the USA will win end up winning over the virus because so many don't want to do the right thing. There aren't fewer cases there are healthier victims recovering. I keep hearing [you can not take our freedom] what good is your freedom if you are dead. </COMMENT 4>

<COMMENT 12> COIVD-19 is the way the rich will control the world! 19 translates to AI in letters (1=A/9=I). So now we have COVID AI. AI stands for artificial intelligence. Now we have COVID Artificial Intelligence. The COV stands for CERTIFICATE OF VACCINATION and ID stands for Identification. So COVID-19=COVID AI=CERTIFICATE OF VACCINATION/IDENTIFICATION/ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. 

You are falling into a trap and the best part is is that you don’t believe that it’s more than a vaccine, it’s too crazy, illegal, or illogical. Maybe, it’s not scientific enough for you. Know that millions already know the truth, awareness is spreading fast. You don’t have to believe, but do the research and compare both sides. What makes more sense to you. Don’t just shrug it off if you don’t know all the reasons behind this. </COMMENT 12>

<COMMENT 1> Phew. That might have been the fastest we ever made a video. Literally working day and night. A huge challenge in talking about Corona was that the science is ongoing. So we put in extra special care to have good sources for this video and will update them in the coming weeks and months. Check them out here: https://sites.google.com/view/sourcescorona 


We could not have made this video without experts who took time in one of the busiest periods of their own careers. A huge thanks especially to Dr James Gurney and Dr Max Roser of Our World in Data for helping us make sure the video was as accurate as it could be in a situation that is changing daily.


Also a big shoutout to https://ourworldindata.org/ – the online publication for research and data on the world’s largest problems – and how to make progress solving them. Check out their site. It also includes a constantly updated page on the Corona Pandemic. Working together with them over the years has been a delight. 


Ok. We are very tired and are going to take a nap now. Stay healthy! </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Can bacteriophage fight corona? </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Damn. I have potato memory. Turns out I've watched this video already but already forgot. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Everything was planned to reduce the world's population, please open your eyes and 👍 </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> It is RNA type virus </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Meanwhile uss protesting black lives matter and before that protesting against corona restrictions. No wonder they are leading nation in corona deaths. They sure do love their protests </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Who’s here after Covid-19! 
Shame about economy 😂 </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> R u demonitized? </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> The problem is that Corona is too well balanced in infection rate and death rate. If the infection rate was too low and deaths too high, people would die quickly but so would the virus. It would be short lived.

 However with infection super high and death rate relatively low and sustainable, this is how it has been able to exist longer than it would allow itself had it not struck the balance.

When the death rate goes up if it mutates into a more efficient killer thats when its unstoppable.

Death is is of secondary significance, stopping transmission is what matters, like putting a barrier in the road that leads off the cliff, too many infections push the barrier further back. When it falls off, it's game over for all who travel that road </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> People need not concern themselves so much about the chronic health issues... Have we considered the *E C O N O M Y*¿? In UK alone our government is spending *12Billion* a month on furlough to staff, hoping to re open soon. Just to put that money in perspective - Entire output of our country is roughly 50B per year (don't quote me) essentially 1 year of furlough takes us 2 years backwards plus more as no work is happening, more things will be out of stock for longer, stores will have reduced shoppers due to social distancing, transport decimated

Bad is an understatement. A very bleak future for all of us regardless of who, if lockdowns persist </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Merhabalar ben Opera kullanıyorum reklam da izlemiyorum:-) </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Follow these steps if you want to cure from coronavirus </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Wash your hands with soap regularly and properly.  Follow a healthy diet, eat fresh green leafy vegetables and citrus fruits like lemon and oranges.

<DESCRIPTION> On today's episode of Global National, new evidence suggests France's first COVID-19 case was earlier than previously though. Redmond Shannon explains ... </DESCRIPTION>

<COMMENT 1> Well, as compared to "injecting clorax into human body" as indoctrinated to Trump-arded Americans, "bleaching hands with clorax" on the part of Canadians is not nearly as pathetic. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Such an awesome video! </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> saw a lot of Americans leaving comments in Quora about what happened to them in last October to December. Probably a lot of Covid-19 patients in USA were diagnosed as flu last year. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> it means China was able to pick up suspicious diseases in their territory, but France is unable to do so. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Well of course it spread sooner. That was the plan. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Circulating long enough to kill a bunch of people before we even knew what was coming </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Covid 19 evolved around copper smelters in Hubei. It is a disease of copper deficiency first transfecting humans from copper contaminated bats who prefer copper diseased insects as they are easier prey with the bacteria Leptospira. This bacteria occurs in 50% of bats in Hubei and causes a disease not dissimilar to Covid.  Paradoxically copper toxicity in humans displays as a copper deficiency due to the different way copper is bound in the body. Copper supply macrophages which kill pneumonia bacteria and if there is a shortage of copper the signal to less specific parts of the immune system initiating a 'cytokein storm' as those other elements are not effective at killing those particular bacteria. Added to this SOD an anti-inflammatory copper enzyme is also denuded so can't stop the cycle of inflammation caused by the storm. BAM DEAD - copper deficient people increases with age BMI sex men have less copper blood serum. BAME lower vit D lower copper uptake. QED. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Best way to lower the coved-19 number is not to test like BC does, the number will not go up if you don’t test them! </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Considering the low death toll numbers in China's neighbouring countries and the huge death toll in Europe, one has to wonder if Covid-19 really did originate in China. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> the moral of story immigration, tourism and our travaler who decide to keep flying around increase the number we have now!
quite normal NB there is such a low case no big air travel not as much immigration or traveler, lower population! no crossbording with new york and ontario,  chinese ppl when back home from china in that festive time! bcuz chinese new eve. the only ppl to blame is our government for the time they take actions and the CCP that warn these traveler before puting them in quarantine,
not the chinese ppl is to blame just make sure you know the difference, did they voluntary and involuntary bring this back here maybe but its still CPP who keep them in FEAR
I warn ppl about this since 26 of december. this is far from being over... everyone need to wear mask in public all the time for some good time. that actually what i would do to put all the chance on our side to defeat this pandemic. even a slight .% is better than nothing and wash youre hands stay safe.... </COMMENT 10>

<COMMENT 13> There are medical personnel reporting that COVID19 was genetically engineered in America. The reports state that a corona flu virus was spliced with particles of DNA from ebola, HIV and SARS strain. The American government ordered the project shutdown because it was too dangerous. Instead the head doctor moved the project to a biolaboratory in Wuhan, China where things got out of hand.  Then medical and security personnel from China reported that some government people wanted the virus manufactured and put in gas to gas protestors and other dissenters to make them too sick to protest government and corporate corruption. Many citizens were protesting corporate greed and corruption, low wages and corrupt government policies that brown nose to the corrupt wealthy thieves that poison our planet and peoples. The protest are happening in Europe, Hong Kong and China every weekend for. Over a year. Please stop media blackout. Our world needs a course in kindness and fairness. So more it be. Blessings ❣️🙏🏼❣️💞 </COMMENT 13>

<COMMENT 18> China must have paid big for this cover story of their escaped pet. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> China may deserve a long awaited apology from many of you! China was the first country that tested and identified the virus but might not be where it's originated. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> China deserves an apology from USA and also from Morrison. He claimed "everyone with common sense knows it came from China".

Where is your common sense now? Are we still going to follow USA into another Iraq war?

China was the first to discover and sequence and shutdown because they have the most competent government in the world who puts its people above corporate profits.. Even now some governments have not locked down and still don't tell people to wear masks and they can't even enforce social distancing laws(if they even have them).

China's has the best approval rating in the world according to surveys from every countries own citizens reporting on their respective govs responses. Thank god this was discovered by China early and they took decisive action. If it was up to USA or the west, we'd all be in a far worse situation.. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 1> Je viens d'apprendre, depuis mars 2011 en Syrie, on s'approche doucement des 400.000 morts mais pas du Covid19. Qu'est-ce qui a été prévu pour tester et traiter la population syrienne ou la population des pays en guerre ? Jusqu'ici les gens sont testés puis traités  à la kalachnikov,  je trouve le procédé  un peu excessif. </COMMENT 1>

I did not know that Vaccines had not been tested against any placebo (ever). I did not know that animal testing would be skipped for the future COVID vaccines..I did not know the 30+ ingredients used in vaccines. I did not know that there are neurotoxic aluminum and mercury molecules in vaccines. I did not know enough to research vaccines before vaccinating my own children. 
I did not know that my own precocious, active, talking son would be vaccine-injured. 
I did not know that my own baby brother (also an M.D.) would become paralyzed (Guillain-Barre) and then die after his swine flu vaccine in the same hospital (Shands) where he had received his medical training. 
I did not know that my mother(an R.N.) would get 8 vaccines in 1 day to "catch-up" with newly added CDC vaccines to keep her job as Head Nurse in the Largest Hospital in the county and then get such severe, aggressive, progressive brain fog in days and become unable to dial a phone or push an elevator button or remember any of her  5 children in a few weeks and then have this "dementia" progress and then die in diapers
I did not know that vaccines were given a blanket indemnity from liability in 1986 and now total immunity for all COVID vaccines for the future. I did not know that we gave more vaccines than any other country starting on day #1...I did not know that we have the highest rate of SIDS of the top 35 industrialized countries... I did not know that we had more autism than any other country... I did not know that Vaccines could injure an infant's brain. 
I did not know that vaccines can result in autoimmunity and neurological damage. I did not know that herd immunity does not apply to vaccines and is a myth created by the CDC. I did not know that Vaccines have almost no effect after about four years. 
I did not know how emotional the topic would be and how angry people would be at me for just asking questions about Vaccine Safety. I did not know that pediatricians were paid to give vaccines. I did not know that the CDC owned the Patents on so many vaccines. 
I did not know that the NIH stands to make Billions of dollars on a COVID vaccine. 
I did not know how angry at myself I would be for not knowing. I did not know that the CDC committed fraud and destroyed their evidence in their vaccine safety studies when it showed vaccines can cause autistic neurological changes..I did not know that a whistleblower came forward with all the evidence but he was silenced. I did not know that Merck committed fraud in their vaccine research repeatedly. I did not know that aluminum molecules in the vaccine ingredients is connected to brain inflammation and brain inflammation has been proven to be connected to autism. 
I did not know that vaccines contained human cells from aborted fetuses..
I did not know how much mainstream media would censor the independent research that showed these facts...I did not know that 90% of all vaccine research that the CDC and FDA use to "approve" vaccines are done by the scientists hired by vaccine makers..I did not know if we were alone... I did not know how many other millions of parents and families in the world have been affected by vaccine reactions..
I did not know how many would find, join, and share the Facebook help group= Vaccine Support Group on Facebook..I did not know that FB would delete the scientific medical research that had been suppressed, deleted, or censored until it happened to us...  Dr.MAS.. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 1> this is bull shit there is no covid-19 they use your own mind to kill you do some  real research on this lie find the real truth </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Basically what ur saying is they are way overpaid 40 to68 bucks an hour. Take home cars at taxpayer expense.  They use traffic stops to profile and oppress the poor and against the average worker just as a testosterone pump. To get a rush by stopping people and chewing their Ace just to get their rocks off. We need to take away high pay and take home cars every traffic stop needs a full written report detailing unsafe behavior that required police action. Not just stopping people for minor violation for a power and control pump or to look for some bigger potential crime.  Law is out of control. We need social worker trained police not military traffic stop trained pin heads with poor judgement and lousy decision making skills </COMMENT 2>

<COMMENT 1> WHO is an evil organization that destroys the world where only arrogant Caucasians who have low IQ but converse to Mensa can be destroyed. By what kind of person and what kind of person can enter? What is this organization for
It's creepy because I don't understand at all.
WHO evaluated the Chinese government. Japanese responded too slowly to the Chinese government. He criticized and denied WHO's Tedros's remorse, saying he would not have spread to Japan all over the world if the Chinese government responded earlier. WHO's Tedros evaluated that the Japanese government is well controlling the coronavirus. The Japanese government is killing the people! The Japanese government responded too late, and the number of deaths from coronavirus infection in Japan is higher than in China. WHO is a group of idiots! WHO is a coronavirus. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> The major aims of WHO is killing innocent human beings.WHO just realized: to advice people to put on surgical masks after too many people are die of Wuhan virus. </COMMENT 2>

<COMMENT 1> The virus is not that deadly lmao </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> The best way to show that you care about human life is by not endangering human life. Let’s say a thousand people were exposed to Covid -19 because of all the protest across the country, those thousand people will infect another two thousand people and so on. Since African Americans die of Covid-19 at much higher rates than other ethnicities then thousands of African Americans will die of exposure to Covid -19 as a result of the protest. How do you prove the value of one black life taken by police brutality by inadvertently killing thousands of other black life’s ? It’s the craziest double standard I have witnessed in a long time. The state government closes down thousands and thousands of businesses and demands people to stay at home except for buying essentials and emergencies. Demands that no people can congregate in groups. Yet suddenly it’s ok for hundreds of thousands of protesters to group tightly together all across the nation in protest. I’m all against police brutality and the way they caused the death of George Floyd but you have to be consistent or you have no credibility. </COMMENT 2>

<COMMENT 1> Yes it is supply side shock. Caused mostly by government themselves. Yet central banks and governments around the world keep thinking as if it was a demand problem. And instead of curing the supply side problem, they manipulate the entire market just to justify their solution to the demand problem.. Even worse, they chose the worst way to stimulate demand: The helicopter money. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Bunch of words.. Nothing new... "we should do innovatively"... Duh.. But what.. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> this is a really good stuff, harvards r smart, but smart people tend to make mistakes because of arrogance, arrogance leads to bloating self esteem and confidence , this crisis nobody knows what will happen next , only what will u do ? to deal with it </COMMENT 3>

<COMMENT 12> This is a great explanation but why does she sound like the announcer in the purge. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> The lockdowns established the precedent that government can stop your "non-essential" business any time for any period for any flimsy reason. On the other hand, any barriers to fiat money printing have now been removed. Government in the New Normal will indirectly buy out and nationalize what is left of the private sector. We are entering decades of stagnation, centralization, corruption, think Soviet Union or 20th century Africa. </COMMENT 13>

<COMMENT 9> Sera verdad amigos dejen su comentario </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> jajajajaja </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Demasiado rápido </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Y si se pudieran crear vacunas por medio de componentes similares a los del jabon pero que no afecten al organismo del ser humano, una idea seria encontrar los elementos necesarios (tanto quimicos como instrumentales) y replicar un "antibacterial" no perjudicial al cuerpo humano </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> La primera ola termino a mitad de febrero, la segunda es la de ahora que esta cayendo. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> En China promueven vacuna con historial de reacciones adversas. Ojalá está no sea igual </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Es obvio.. en Italia se dice que descubrieron que la oms miente... leí que en Italia abrieron un cuerpo y descubrieron que el corona"virus" no es eso... es una bacteria!!! No he podido encontrar noticias públicas.. comienzo a creer que es por que a nadie le beneficia eso. Ni a Italia ni a otros países que obviamente conoce lo real de todo esto.. </COMMENT 15>

<COMMENT 17> En lo personal me aplicaría de cuál quier país, q' la hubieran probado en humanos, exepto la de china, con lo q' ha pasado para nada tendría confianza </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Creo que la cura sería medicamentos juntados con anticuerpos . </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Ya han intentado buscar la cura les digo ( son los sonidos fuertes y musica fuetes directamente si lo intentan veran que el CODIV-19 explota) algunos virus explotan por sonidos fuertes intenten con los sonidos basicamente explotan </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 3> That's what you get when you contract IT infrastructure upgrades to the lowest bidder.  In the end it will cost billions and it will still be something that has been obsolete for the past 20 years.  Just look at the phoenix payment system.

<COMMENT 5> TRUDEAU GOV IS A FAILURE </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> You are not helping go away Africa Any place this is a political assault you should be ashamed. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> I like how this one fearmongering video is constantly pinned to my YouTube front page. All the other topical videos in that "section" get cycled. There's a ton of Covid related videos. However this one specific piece of fearmongering is constantly on my front page, constantly being suggested to me. All the other articles and videos are about how the cases are on a down trend. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> This guy is a fraud.  His degree is questionable.  Watch the "Fairweather" documentary that shows where Amir got the money for his cottage in Atlantic Canada and the fraud he tried to commit to get money for his immigrant family (still living abroad). </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Since COVID19 is presymptomatic/asymptomatic transmission I do not understand why Oakridge Mall in Vancouver does not insist that all customers/employee/contractors wear masks.  To protect each other, everyone has to wear a mask. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Amir Guy should go back to his own country.. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> giving billions of tax dollars over a period of one term and a half in office...giving tax dollars to the middle east mostly and AFRICA WILL DO THAT . Tam should be removed, no confidence in her 'leadership'. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> ONTARIO NEEDS A NEW GOVERNMENT </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> For a second I thought this was David Wallace from The Office. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Fax/email situation is ass-backwards. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> all government in the world are full of  S... I dont know anyone with covid- 19 </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Let me guess, modernize means debt goes up. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> e have very strong and collaborative leadership," Archie Clements, professor of infectious disease and epidemiology at Curtin University, said of Australia. 
"Our government set up a national cabinet where heads of all the different jurisdictions regardless of their political party were able to come together to manage the epidemic at a national level.
"That is where the failing is in the United States and Europe; lack of collaborative and open government and politicisation of the response." </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> But I thought Canada was an perfect country </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> There are always alarmists. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> This incompetence is systemic through all levels and departments of government in Canada. Now that it's directly affecting people's health it has finally become plain to see by all. </COMMENT 20>

Recently i went out and i always get the exact same items but noticed something different, that my grocery bill almost tripled since three weeks ago! Every single item the same on two grocery list one is $130 this weeks is over $300 i need some explanation or is it just compensation for the 40Billion spend on the CERB cuz im getting real done eith the economy rn. Im just starting my life and i already need to deal with overpriced insurance that we are forced to buy. A currupt realestate and now this, like im not even done school and i want to stop living. </COMMENT 2>

<COMMENT 2> people so need a middle man between them and their creator - </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Unless you exerpted his comment on Trump inaccurately, as you fake news channels so often do, this shows even the Dalai Lama doesn't know or see all with clarity.  Donald Trump is the most moral human being the Presidency has seen since Reagan.  And Trump's thinking of "always America" is "too small"??  Since when does President Trump think only of America - he looks to make all parties gain, INCLUDING America (unlike previous recent presidents who let up get "raped") - so the Dalai Lama has not and does not see how Americans have been suffering during the past 40 years with massive loss of jobs in manufacturing etc - perhaps he still thinks our streets are paved with gold" as sooo many foreigners have thought in the past.  But yet he himself, the Dalai Lama, and the leader of Tibetans, has devoted his life to securing Tibet again from the Chinese!!!  So Tibetans and he can think of themselves, but we and Trump should not??  And he was too cowardly to directly and clearly say the US press needs to grow in truth and quit creating fake news -instead, he just waved off the opportunity to help right a grave misdirection so much of the American press has taken with "oh...that's your business!"??? SAD SAD SAD!!!  Moral leader of the world? Not in this instance - more like he's just doing good PR for himself and the Tibetans, as usual, since that is his life's work !!!!  I also hope he, the Dalai Lama, reads this and takes my words to heart. </COMMENT 3>

<COMMENT 1> I love that your sharing this, living here just outside of Tokyo I can fully relate to how they did everything. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> I live in Kanagawa and working as an ALT. The schools have received guidelines on how to operate for 2 weeks and for the rest of the school year.
Right now,  at least for English classes as far as I know, lessons are reduced to 30 minutes. There will be no group work or pair work, no talking between students in class. Mostly listening exercises. It is a very, very odd thing to do. And the number of required English lessons has been reduced. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Very interesting, thank you! (and that little train in the snow... What a fairytale!) </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Amazing and detailed video, and the last snow scene was beautiful! Do you perhaps have any recommendations for a good website to keep an eye on to see when the travel ban will be lifted (sites in Japanese are also ok)? </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Regarding 100k I have received mine last week. But it all depends when applied and the city you live in. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> thanks for the video, very informative! </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> It is nothing more than a globalist initiative because they lost America to the world health organisation and Mr Faucie and all the other scumbags running and giving money to the globalist movement go God screw you Satan. Go trump </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> This video is very well made! I still don't get it Japan has a roadmap now for pandemic containment, especially for foreign affairs. When would they lift the travel restriction measures? What about company workers that are travelling from and to Japan? </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> in America, Coronavirus Lives Matter. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> U r just amazing Greg.
I have been watching your videos for more than a year but this is my first comment. I was always interested in Japan but I was never interested in the boring stuff in which there's someone talking, giving some sorta information and you just have to listen.But thanks to you, here I am watching a **boring** video on Corona virus Timeline and I am actually enjoying it. Plus I am looking forward to your next video.
Love your work.Keep going.<3 </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> *WEARING FACE MASKS IS NOT PROVEN TO HAVE MEANINGFUL MEDICAL BENEFITS*
The claim that the mask can reduce risks of infection from those who have the coronavirus is false. The only way to remove the risk is to stay at home, well away from others. This is the basis of physical distancing. 

Australia and New Zealand has never mandated masks be worn widely by the general public. But, any way you look and interpret the statistics, both Australia and New Zealand has had much fewer coronavirus fatalities due to more robust and science-based responses, policies and strategies, on both national and regional levels.

<COMMENT 12> This is a PEEENNNN </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> From Osaka!
Most Japanese are thinking it is thanks to our efforts and manners that the number of cases did not fluctuate, not the government’s efforts. 
Many of mayors and leaders of local including Osaka and Tokyo are more appreciated. I’m so proud of Yoshimura san who is a leader of Osaka. He really is doing great even he moved Japanese national government to move. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Your videos are the best!  Thank you so much </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> I strongly believe wearing a mask makes a huge difference. Countries where wearing a mask is the norm during flu season never got hit too bad. Countries where residents were told NOT to wear masks because even the healthcare workers didn’t have enough (example, italy + france), suffered quickly. I live in France, and the numbers show that once people started wearing masks, that’s when the dramatic increase in cases slowed. That’s just my observation. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Estimated 50 thousand dead in Britain. We were told by the Government masks were not needed and wouldnt help.. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> I don't know why , but i think Mrs.Yuriko  Koike will be the new primeminister. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Remarkable! Thank you. Rich (A NYS resident) </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Hello Greg
Thank you so much for the update
Hope you are all staying safe in Tokyo
Don't worry about the virus . Taking precautionary measures would eradicate this out of Japan very soon. Hope you all are staying in good health. Be positive both physically and mentally.
Thank you </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Just to clarify for people
(Because i know many people don't know this)

Scientific studies have shown that overall fitness and weight does not change risk of infection for any virus (including covid19) or bacteria.

Keep in mind I'm talking about fitness&BMI, not health(asthma etc) or diet.

The idea that slimmer people get sick less often is a myth.
However people who eat a varied and healthy diet, regardless of their BMI, do see benefits over people who eat processed food due to the healthy food supporting the immune system better(with more nutrients and vitamins).

Despite the link between obesity and eating "junk food", plenty of people within normal BMI ranges also eat unhealthily, just in smaller portions, putting them at equal risk.

"Being obese puts you at higer risk" is similar to saying "wet pavement causes rainfall"

Correlation =/= Causation

So low obesity rates won't be the reason Japan is doing so well.
Although overall healthier diets in Japan may be a contributing factor to the success.

Not that I blame people for assuming that "fat=getting sick more", it's a pretty widespread misconception/rumor.
I thought it was true too until I did my CELLS191 paper at uni. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 2> Je rappelle juste que H1N1 faisait peur à l'époque tout comme le SRAS, le MERS et actuellement le COVID-19. Le problème, c'est que les trois précédents ont été géré de façon à ce qu'il n'y ait aucun confinement. Concernant le COVID-19,... C'est bien plus qu'un simple scandale d'État, c'est le Scandale du siècle.

Pour rappel, le SRAS de 2003 et le MERS de 1992 au Moyen Orient étaient aussi des coronavirus tout comme l'actuel COVID-19. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Bonjour,
Je suppose qu'on ne me lira pas, mais rien de grave, besoin d'écrire une pensée, une idée de faire.
Et si on élisait un anonyme au prochaine présidentielle qui démissionnerait dès sa prise de fonction. Puis se représenterait ensuite pour un deuxième mandat et redimensionnerait à nouveau. On présenterait toutes les 2 élections (2 mandats oblige) un nouveau candidat qui démissionnerait encore et encore jusqu'à ce que les autres décident enfin de laisser la place. Faire que le vote blanc deviennent concret.
Pendant les phases de démission, ce serait régions, départements, communes qui seraient à la barre (décentralisation forcée).
On m a souvent dit que pour changer les choses il fallait le faire de l'intérieur... pas évident, l'intérieur contamine ou désespère. Là, on leur enlèverait leur jouet jusqu'à ce qu'ils consentent à le prêter. Bloquer uniquement les joueurs du haut, laisser agir et penser ceux du bas.
Moi, je ne peux obtenir 500 signatures, pas assez connu. Mais je suis près à être cette anonyme et à ne pas parler au nom des français. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Hélas, le meilleur sujet traité depuis le début de cette période, et avec moult références! Pourquoi ne pas avoir titré simplement que le COVID 19 est une crise écologique?? C'est ce que je pense depuis le début; que ce virus soit naturel ou de synthèse, cela ne change rien à cet état de fait que presque personne n'ose souligner. Quant à mon interrogation sur ses origines, il est certain que les causes réelles seront longues à mettre en évidence...

En 2004, cette industrie vaut 100 MILLIARDS de dollars. Très intéressant pour le gouvernement chinois. En 2018, cette industrie a atteinte 148 MILLIARDS de yuans. La Chine est exhortée à stopper ces marchés définitivement.
 Quatre mois après l'apparition du Covid-19 dans cette ville du centre du pays, les marchés de rue ont rouvert malgré une réputation sulfureuse qui leur vaut des appels à la fermeture depuis l'Australie ou encore les Etats-Unis. Si l'Organisation mondiale de la santé (OMS) a appelé les Etats à INTERDIRE la vente d'animaux sauvages, elle n'a pas plaidé pour la fermeture des marchés. https://information.tv5monde.com/video/coronavirus-en-chine-wuhan-rouvre-ses-marches </COMMENT 9>

Boule de feu tu fu
Puis jaillit de l’espace la douche bienfaisante
La douche incessante des comètes chargées des prémices de la vie.
Du temps lourd de ces milliards d’années apparue le vivant
La mer fille de la terre fit du vivant le berceau 
De ce berceau naquit au point culminant de l’évolution : L’humanité
Puis ne cessa de croître et d’évoluer l’être humain en nombre et intelligence
Si nombreux et si peu respectueux qu’il fit dépérir le tissu vivant de la terre
Ce tissu que l’on nomme biodiversité avait été la mère nourricière de l’humanité passé
La mère terre se vengea sur ses enfants en vomissant des tempêtes, des ouragans et des virus
Fiévreuse elle pleura de la tête au pied des larmes de glaces fondantes
Sur le cimetière de l’humanité poussa alors la fleur de l’espoir 
Le signe avenir de l’harmonie naissante entre les humains ,les animaux et le monde végétal. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Que les chercheurs en biodiversité défendent leur emploi, je le comprend (même si ça ne relève pas des activités essentielles..) mais leur exploitation de l'émotion actuelle est particulièrement cynique. La peste, la variole, le choléra, la tuberculose (et j'en passe!) auprès desquelles le COVID19 est une plaisanterie, sont apparues à l'âge d'or de la biodiversité. La disparition de la peste est passée par l'éradication (partielle, hélas) des puces et poux. La leçon qu'on pourrait tirer de ce verbiage, c'est qu'avant d'aménager une zone naturelle, il faut éradiquer les espèces sauvages (notamment les chauve-souris!) qui s'y trouvent. </COMMENT 18>

<COMMENT 1> I am so happy to see an MD who actually recognizes that natural remedies are effective and can play an integral part in primary prevention of disease, as well as a cure for disease in some circumstances. Being married to a Kashmiri, I have learned they add tumeric, red chili pepper powder, and black pepper powder to just about everything! </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> i HAVE been using tumeric religiously since my strokes and my bouts with cancer and i am cancer free now, also have my blood pressure under control. I take mine with honey. I make the golden tumeric with organic honey </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> I cook everyday with curcuma and peper is it efficient. When cooked? </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Hats off to your integrity Doc. You're a real physician not the money monger like the majority. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> I am from Pakistan we cook our food with tumeric i use it in my green tea with lemon honey ginger sometimes garlic too and  cinnamon and for itchy throat mix it with honey and tumeric in hot or warm milk
Also every morning eat 2 to 3 dates empty stomach for energy
You can buy fresh tumeric from any Pakistani stores </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Raw roots of  turmeric has got a very strong but tasty. But eating them often you'll love it . </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Take Tumeric powder with oil or oily food and warm water for better absorblility in addition to black pepper </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> According to Ayurveda, the dosage is one half  teaspoon of turmeric mixed with warm water or milk with  pepper  . </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> very good quality for your video. so thank you.


I have benefited a lot from screaming. However, the service of this hospital is very good. The doctor saw the stream observing the distant patient. www.orbishealth.com </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Wait a minute. STOP STOP STOP the train!!!!!!!! How the fuck is this video a year and a half old and we just discovered COVID-19 2 months ago. Well this proves Fauci knew this disease was in America first. THAT LITTLE BASTARD </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Sir should we take this in summer? </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Take care Doc, the pharma guys gonna come after you. They might even come up with a bogus claim ... 'Turmeric is hazardous to human in the long run, according to some mad scientist' </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Take cod liver oil </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Doc where can i buy that supplement. I cant take the power straight specially i have acid reflux. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Hi doctor, I like your videos. Do you have advice how to gain weight? </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Roots! </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Kellner...waiter in Deutsche!...keller ist basement. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Even better than buying in bulk would be to grow it your own turmeric which is not that difficult and then you can dry it and powder it yourself and it’s effectiveness and potency and health qualities are increased </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> How come the title has name Covid 19 where the video is uploaded in 2018 </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 3> Sehr geehrter Herr Professor Lesch, würde von Ihnen und Ihrem Team gerne mal etwas zu dem UFO Phänomen hören, auch will ich mit Ihnen übereinstimme das es etwas anderes sein muss als Außerirdischer Besuch, aber es ist doch irgendetwas??? </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Zeigen sie mir ein Isoliertes Covi19!!!! </COMMENT 4>

<COMMENT 11> Bergamo haben sie Infizierte zu den Alten Risikopatienten in Plegeheimen dazu quartiert haben. Herr Lesch, wenn dann richtig recherchieren. ca. 3000 Tote wurden nicht auf Covid19 getestet sondern pauschal dazu gezählt. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Hol du mal den Wagen, Harry... </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Die Krankenhäuser sind leer! Wo sind die Coronafälle denn alle? Es sterben weit mehr Menschen an Herzinfarkt, Alkohol, Rauchen, Im Straßenverkehr, Selbstmord und an Hunger!
Das war mit meiner Wertschätzung für Sie! </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Der größte Propagandapapst der öffentlich-unrechtlichen. Aber lassen wir ihn reden. WIR BEKOMMEN UNSER LAND ZURÜCK. Soviel ist sicher !!! </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Herr Lesch, kann es sein, dass Ihre Hypothese gerade an der Erfahrung gescheitert ist? Tja, das kommt davon, wenn man fachfremde Leute auf Themen loslässt, von denen sie nichts verstehen. Das ist nicht einfach nur peinlich, das ist gemeingefährlich. Suchen Sie sich einen Job, bei dem Sie keinen Schaden anrichten können, Herr Lesch! Sie sind eine Schande für die Wissenschaft! Ich schreibe das, weil ich der Meinung bin, dass man FakeNews nicht unkommentiert lassen darf! </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Dr.Wodarg hatte recht, das war eine normale Grippewelle, die Maßnahmen sind völlig überzogen, man hat Deutschland mit Anlauf vor die Wand gefahren, und die Übersterblichkeit in den südlichen Regionen und den USA kann man auch erklären, siehe letztes Interview von Dr. Wodarg, also Maßnahmen sofort beenden, bevor noch mehr Schaden angerichtet wird, und ansonsten mein Lieblingszitat von Dieter Nuhr: Wenn man keine Ahnung hat, einfach mal F h ..." </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Guten Tag Herr Lesch,
Die Hochrechnung auf 5 Prozent 
Beatmungspflichtige ist falsch.
Infizierte und an Covid 19 Erkrankte dürfen nämlich nicht gleichgesetzt werden.
Diesen Fehler hat das RKI begangen.
Aber es erkranken nur 10 Prozent der Infizierten. Also müsste die 5 Prozent durch 10 dividiert werden, was 0.5 Prozent ergibt. Und selbst diese 0.5 Prozent sind noch zu hoch, denn nicht alle Erkrankte auf Intensivstationen bekommen eine Beatmung.
Das Gesundheitssystem war somit niemals auch nur annähernd gefährdet </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Harry, Du träumst doch nicht etwa immer noch von der Mondlandung  ?!? </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Wie kann man sich für Geld so verkaufen. Der Mann ist kein Mann der Wissenschaft sonder der Indoktrinierung. Tschüss Kanal </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 1> Stay safe everyone!
CC's available in Arabic, English, French, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Thai, Turkish and Vietnamese. Thanks to everyone who helps contribute and shares this video 🙏 </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> This is really sad that some people actually drank this stuff thinking it would save their lives.  The worst is bleach part. Trump should know better but doesn't care. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> A grown man really thought that was a good idea </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Darwin </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> That’s some very dangerous genes that could be spreading to the next generation.... </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> @Covid-19 1v1 me </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> If you drink isopropyl alcohol or bleach, you're just doing Darwin's work. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Did he blame Trump for his own stupidity? </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> How do people drink hand sanitiser and bleach? Surely the smell and initial taste from the first swig is enough to put them off? Do they have no sense of smell and taste? </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> This video is obviously fake! I drink two to three bottles of rubbing alcohol a day and I feel fine! </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Guys I drank a little bit of isopropyl alcohol wish me luck so I survive (no joke tho I thought of mixing no alcoholic champagne with isopropyl alcohol and drank it no joke) </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> so covid19 = sars2 mentioned in the video? </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> So if I'm understanding it correctly is to not drink the bleach rather snort it to get rid of covid-19 </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> And now you're blind </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> This is an extraordinarily bad idea... </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> You can thank that man who sits in the white house whose name rhymes with "rump" for things like this.  If you are not familiar with him he is the same guy who sends out tweets giving Covid 19 medical advice but he is not a doctor.  If he still does not sound familiar, you might recognize him as the guy who ordered tear gas to be shot at peaceful demonstrators (in memory of George Floyd) to clear his path for a "photo op".  

Yes ladies and gentlemen, that is our United States president I am talking about.  He is making America great again, one tweet at a time. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> It amazes me, as a 13 year old, that I have more common sense than people who are older than me. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> The fact someone did this just makes me feel better that even tho I never was able to go to college, I'm still not as dumb as these people. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> 6:50 you think it's over yet? Well we have "AC" who decided to do something even more dangerous </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 1> Best advice:
Boost your immune system.

<COMMENT 2> Lol lies,lies,lies. There is no virus and so he is paid by the alt right as it seems like the majority of the"expert's" that showed up on YouTube. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Now bill gates started producing their vaccine PAID the doctors wt billons . So He can earned also more trillons . </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Lier </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> He is telling the truth! I also got well with the AZITHROMYCIN ANTIBIOTICS AND LOTS OF VITAMIN C. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> NEVER been a successful coronavirus vaccine. You are are a fucking moron if you line up for one. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Correction, this is NOT an especially lethal virus. Several studies have shown an IFR of 0.5% -- 0.25%, the range of the common flu. Stop the fear porn and get on with life. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Can you say probable biological modified virus? </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> How come that SARS stopped spread and SARS-Cov-2 doesn't stop? (in the desert like in Sweden for example)  Why?  I would like to have a good aswer to that. Why China doesn't want us to know about the patient zero? I would like to have a good anwser to that, too. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> I got maybe 2 mins in and then the guy said it's much more lethal  than other corona's which we now know is total bollocks. Sars 1 was much more lethal. This podcast can fuck off with its total nonsense. It's a new Flu and nothing else. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Doctor, I had read that a lab in Isreal was able to isolate a human protein that kills this virus. Is this true? </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Yeah i heared cov 19 use it as a body spray too . </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> no vaccine for sars, mers, herpes, cancer, aids, hiv, malaria, dengue, .... </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Yes daily high dose vitamin c good bye corona </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> I think that one of Korea's big secret is Kimchi, as it contains potent antiviral ingredients such as garlic, ginger, and chili.  WHO states that there is no clinical study that garlic helps so they dismiss the claim as myth.  But WHO has no evidence to the contrary, either.   And yes, there are molecular docking programs that show components in these foods can reduce virulence of SARS-COV-2.  It still appears as though a plant-based diet (great for reducing von Willebrand Factors associated with fatal COVID-19) combined with vitamin D3, NAC, zinc, quercetin, and alpha lipoic acid will help, although, admittedly, it's hard to get the $3B USD to prove it.  Why wait for a vaccine that might not be ready for many more months at the earliest? </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Why do they never talk about the need for the mass of humanity to get this virus and start building immunity? 

Why? 

Vaccines manufacturing companies?  

High tech companies wanting all of us to say imprisoned in our underwear doing Zoom video calls? 

Democrats to bring Donald T down? 

China-Russia axis to weaken USA? Facebook? All will be revealed by June 2021. 

The social unrest is just starting on this HOAX. Any trigger will ignite the fire of miserable people!! SAD world no? Aiyo what to do no? Aiyo!! </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> With or without ADHD, the background music is extremely distractful - meaningless!!! </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Have they shut the border with North Korea yet then? lol </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> say my name!

you're goddamn right....! </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 2> and I thought when the temp reaches 25C the virus would only last 1.5 min!  am I wrong?? </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> tell them you're a protester .. covid doesn't  effect protesters </COMMENT 3>

Peace fellow humans 🙏 </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> 7 out of 10 Canadians think polls they don't like are rigged.  But 9 out of 10 Canadians trust polling results they like. (ok - snark)  But if you find that you've never ever seen your preferences reflected ia a poll,  maybe your opinions are not as popular as you think.  If you reply...everyone I know says what I am saying..... That's why pollsters have "sample sizes and distribution larger than your buddies and you.  The phrasing of the "poll question" is the weak spot. "Push polls" try to box you into agreeing. My Conservative M.P. sends out nothing but push polls.  Do you support Trudeau's mindless attacks on Canadian's rights?  (Would you agree to stop beating your wife if she asks nicely?

<COMMENT 17> Would opening the border for mindless recreation travel help with more effective social distancing and better control of the spread of the virus?  Just as long as travellers their spend money here it’s worth the increased risk, right? </COMMENT 17>

<COMMENT 4> <COVID-19 TRUTH>
*Most people won’t get the virus.*
*Most of the people who get it won’t display symptoms.*
*Most of the people who display symptoms will only be mildly sick.*
*Most of the people with severe symptoms will never be critically ill.*
*And most of the people who get critically ill will survive.*

This is borne out by the numerous serological studies which show, again and again, that the infection fatality ratio is on par with flu.
( https://swprs.org/studies-on-covid-19-lethality/ )
There is no science – and increasingly little rational discussion – to justify the lockdown measures and overall sense of global panic.
Nevertheless, it’s always good to get official acknowledgement of the truth, even if it has to be leaked.
Here are three leaks showing that those in power know that the coronavirus poses no threat, and in no way justifies the lockdown that is going to destroy the livelihoods of so many.
1. “IT’S ALL BULLSHIT!”
On May 26th Dr Alexander Myasnikov, Russia’s head of coronavirus information, gave an interview to former-Presidential candidate Ksenia Sobchak in which he apparently let slip his true feelings.
( https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/05/27/its-all-bullsht-russias-coronavirus-information-chief-says-of-virus-fears-a70398 )
Believing the interview over, and the camera turned off, Myasnikov said:
It’s all bullshit […] It’s all exaggerated. It’s an acute respiratory disease with minimal mortality […] Why has the whole world been destroyed? That I don’t know,”

<COMMENT 5> The very existence of this virus has NOT repeat NOT been scientifically proven, let alone its causing disease !!! </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Say no to this vaxis of evil !!!  Disinfectants for nothing at all, will only cause you allergies and cancer in the long run !!! </COMMENT 6>

<COMMENT 10> Excellent video. Very concise, well organized, & practical. Thanks! </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> “Despite Moderna’s cheery press release this week, the clinical trial results for its groundbreaking COVID vaccine could not be much worse.”
“The vaccine, developed and championed by Anthony Fauci and financed by Bill Gates, used an experimental mRNA technology…”
“Three of the 15 human guinea pigs in the high dose cohort (250 mcg) suffered a ‘serious adverse event’ within 43 days of receiving Moderna’s jab. Moderna…acknowledged that three volunteers developed Grade 3 systemic events defined by the FDA as ‘Preventing daily activity and requiring medical intervention’.”
“Moderna allowed only exceptionally healthy volunteers to participate in the study. A vaccine with those reaction rates could cause grave injuries in 1.5 billion humans if administered to ‘every person on earth’.” (Robert F Kennedy, Jr., Children’s Health Defense, May 22, 2020, “Vaccine Trial Catastrophe: Moderna Vaccine has 20% ‘Serious’ Injury Rate in High Dose Group”) </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Effort of our medical team https://youtu.be/_8Ya0-Qeqlo </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> The CDC has proven this to be unnecessary as of 5 days ago. The virus does not spread easily on surfaces so this video is just bad information at this point. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Umm.... how about we don't spray Clorox on broccoli or wash fruit with soap..... </COMMENT 14>

<COMMENT 19> I posted this Doctor's tips on carefully cleaning, wiping down your groceries after you came home..posted in a lot of places,
Coming back now on May 31st, after watching MSNBC, a physician mentioned posts like this in passing to stress its HANDWASHING and SOCIAL DISTANCING which are most important.
He said wiping down your groceries and other tips making the rounds are basically OVERKILL, that there isn't really much evidence from CDC and other researchers showing this is a length of carefullness going too far.  No real evidence that wide virus spread through SURFACES is not what they're seeing.
As to me, after leaving stores, I DO wash my hands with alcohol based hand washing, but not wiping down every product anymore.    
Thanks anyway, to this physician Jeff Van Wingen for having us be more careful, even if too cautious about 'sterile technique.'   I would only suggest that this level of care is not widely reported by CDC as of May 2020.   Stay safe, of course.  But cheesh...keep wearing your masks when shopping  where ya get close to people or touch them. </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 2> Je rappelle juste que H1N1 faisait peur à l'époque tout comme le SRAS, le MERS et actuellement le COVID-19. Le problème, c'est que les trois précédents ont été géré de façon à ce qu'il n'y ait aucun confinement. Concernant le COVID-19,... C'est bien plus qu'un simple scandale d'État, c'est le Scandale du siècle.

Pour rappel, le SRAS de 2003 et le MERS de 1992 au Moyen Orient étaient aussi des coronavirus tout comme l'actuel COVID-19. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Bonjour,
Je suppose qu'on ne me lira pas, mais rien de grave, besoin d'écrire une pensée, une idée de faire.
Et si on élisait un anonyme au prochaine présidentielle qui démissionnerait dès sa prise de fonction. Puis se représenterait ensuite pour un deuxième mandat et redimensionnerait à nouveau. On présenterait toutes les 2 élections (2 mandats oblige) un nouveau candidat qui démissionnerait encore et encore jusqu'à ce que les autres décident enfin de laisser la place. Faire que le vote blanc deviennent concret.
Pendant les phases de démission, ce serait régions, départements, communes qui seraient à la barre (décentralisation forcée).
On m a souvent dit que pour changer les choses il fallait le faire de l'intérieur... pas évident, l'intérieur contamine ou désespère. Là, on leur enlèverait leur jouet jusqu'à ce qu'ils consentent à le prêter. Bloquer uniquement les joueurs du haut, laisser agir et penser ceux du bas.
Moi, je ne peux obtenir 500 signatures, pas assez connu. Mais je suis près à être cette anonyme et à ne pas parler au nom des français. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Hélas, le meilleur sujet traité depuis le début de cette période, et avec moult références! Pourquoi ne pas avoir titré simplement que le COVID 19 est une crise écologique?? C'est ce que je pense depuis le début; que ce virus soit naturel ou de synthèse, cela ne change rien à cet état de fait que presque personne n'ose souligner. Quant à mon interrogation sur ses origines, il est certain que les causes réelles seront longues à mettre en évidence... Toutefois, je pense que connaître l'information qui a fait paniquer l'ex-ministre de la santé est à rechercher en priorité (;-) </COMMENT 4>

<COMMENT 9> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPpoJGYlW54&t=336s Des animaux viennent du monde entier pour alimenter ces marchés industrialisés, de 54 ESPÈCES de bêtes sauvages. En 2004, cette industrie vaut 100 MILLIARDS de dollars. Très intéressant pour le gouvernement chinois. En 2018, cette industrie a atteinte 148 MILLIARDS de yuans. La Chine est exhortée à stopper ces marchés définitivement.
 Quatre mois après l'apparition du Covid-19 dans cette ville du centre du pays, les marchés de rue ont rouvert malgré une réputation sulfureuse qui leur vaut des appels à la fermeture depuis l'Australie ou encore les Etats-Unis. Si l'Organisation mondiale de la santé (OMS) a appelé les Etats à INTERDIRE la vente d'animaux sauvages, elle n'a pas plaidé pour la fermeture des marchés. https://information.tv5monde.com/video/coronavirus-en-chine-wuhan-rouvre-ses-marches </COMMENT 9>

<COMMENT 17> Terre fille du soleil
Boule de feu tu fu
Puis jaillit de l’espace la douche bienfaisante
La douche incessante des comètes chargées des prémices de la vie.
Du temps lourd de ces milliards d’années apparue le vivant
La mer fille de la terre fit du vivant le berceau 
De ce berceau naquit au point culminant de l’évolution : L’humanité
Puis ne cessa de croître et d’évoluer l’être humain en nombre et intelligence
Si nombreux et si peu respectueux qu’il fit dépérir le tissu vivant de la terre
Ce tissu que l’on nomme biodiversité avait été la mère nourricière de l’humanité passé
La mère terre se vengea sur ses enfants en vomissant des tempêtes, des ouragans et des virus
Fiévreuse elle pleura de la tête au pied des larmes de glaces fondantes
Sur le cimetière de l’humanité poussa alors la fleur de l’espoir 
Le signe avenir de l’harmonie naissante entre les humains ,les animaux et le monde végétal. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Que les chercheurs en biodiversité défendent leur emploi, je le comprend (même si ça ne relève pas des activités essentielles..) mais leur exploitation de l'émotion actuelle est particulièrement cynique. La peste, la variole, le choléra, la tuberculose (et j'en passe!) auprès desquelles le COVID19 est une plaisanterie, sont apparues à l'âge d'or de la biodiversité. La disparition de la peste est passée par l'éradication (partielle, hélas) des puces et poux. La leçon qu'on pourrait tirer de ce verbiage, c'est qu'avant d'aménager une zone naturelle, il faut éradiquer les espèces sauvages (notamment les chauve-souris!) qui s'y trouvent. </COMMENT 18>

<COMMENT 1> I am so happy to see an MD who actually recognizes that natural remedies are effective and can play an integral part in primary prevention of disease, as well as a cure for disease in some circumstances. Being married to a Kashmiri, I have learned they add tumeric, red chili pepper powder, and black pepper powder to just about everything! </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> i HAVE been using tumeric religiously since my strokes and my bouts with cancer and i am cancer free now, also have my blood pressure under control. I take mine with honey. I make the golden tumeric with organic honey </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> I cook everyday with curcuma and peper is it efficient. When cooked? </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Hats off to your integrity Doc. You're a real physician not the money monger like the majority. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> I am from Pakistan we cook our food with tumeric i use it in my green tea with lemon honey ginger sometimes garlic too and  cinnamon and for itchy throat mix it with honey and tumeric in hot or warm milk
Also every morning eat 2 to 3 dates empty stomach for energy
You can buy fresh tumeric from any Pakistani stores </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Raw roots of  turmeric has got a very strong but tasty. But eating them often you'll love it . </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Take Tumeric powder with oil or oily food and warm water for better absorblility in addition to black pepper </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> According to Ayurveda, the dosage is one half  teaspoon of turmeric mixed with warm water or milk with  pepper  . </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> very good quality for your video. so thank you.


I have benefited a lot from screaming. However, the service of this hospital is very good. The doctor saw the stream observing the distant patient. www.orbishealth.com </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Wait a minute. STOP STOP STOP the train!!!!!!!! How the fuck is this video a year and a half old and we just discovered COVID-19 2 months ago. Well this proves Fauci knew this disease was in America first. THAT LITTLE BASTARD </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Sir should we take this in summer? </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Take care Doc, the pharma guys gonna come after you. They might even come up with a bogus claim ... 'Turmeric is hazardous to human in the long run, according to some mad scientist' </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Take cod liver oil </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Doc where can i buy that supplement. I cant take the power straight specially i have acid reflux. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Hi doctor, I like your videos. Do you have advice how to gain weight? </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Roots! </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Kellner...waiter in Deutsche!...keller ist basement. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Even better than buying in bulk would be to grow it your own turmeric which is not that difficult and then you can dry it and powder it yourself and it’s effectiveness and potency and health qualities are increased </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> How come the title has name Covid 19 where the video is uploaded in 2018 </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> I see only 1 link vs 3? </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 3> Sehr geehrter Herr Professor Lesch, würde von Ihnen und Ihrem Team gerne mal etwas zu dem UFO Phänomen hören, auch will ich mit Ihnen übereinstimme das es etwas anderes sein muss als Außerirdischer Besuch, aber es ist doch irgendetwas??? </COMMENT 3>

<COMMENT 13> Die Krankenhäuser sind leer! Wo sind die Coronafälle denn alle? Es sterben weit mehr Menschen an Herzinfarkt, Alkohol, Rauchen, Im Straßenverkehr, Selbstmord und an Hunger!

<COMMENT 14> Der größte Propagandapapst der öffentlich-unrechtlichen. Aber lassen wir ihn reden. WIR BEKOMMEN UNSER LAND ZURÜCK. Soviel ist sicher !!! </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Herr Lesch, kann es sein, dass Ihre Hypothese gerade an der Erfahrung gescheitert ist? Tja, das kommt davon, wenn man fachfremde Leute auf Themen loslässt, von denen sie nichts verstehen. Das ist nicht einfach nur peinlich, das ist gemeingefährlich. Suchen Sie sich einen Job, bei dem Sie keinen Schaden anrichten können, Herr Lesch! Sie sind eine Schande für die Wissenschaft! Ich schreibe das, weil ich der Meinung bin, dass man FakeNews nicht unkommentiert lassen darf! </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Dr.Wodarg hatte recht, das war eine normale Grippewelle, die Maßnahmen sind völlig überzogen, man hat Deutschland mit Anlauf vor die Wand gefahren, und die Übersterblichkeit in den südlichen Regionen und den USA kann man auch erklären, siehe letztes Interview von Dr. Wodarg, also Maßnahmen sofort beenden, bevor noch mehr Schaden angerichtet wird, und ansonsten mein Lieblingszitat von Dieter Nuhr: Wenn man keine Ahnung hat, einfach mal F h ..." </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Guten Tag Herr Lesch,
Die Hochrechnung auf 5 Prozent 
Beatmungspflichtige ist falsch.
Infizierte und an Covid 19 Erkrankte dürfen nämlich nicht gleichgesetzt werden.
Diesen Fehler hat das RKI begangen.
Aber es erkranken nur 10 Prozent der Infizierten. Also müsste die 5 Prozent durch 10 dividiert werden, was 0.5 Prozent ergibt. Und selbst diese 0.5 Prozent sind noch zu hoch, denn nicht alle Erkrankte auf Intensivstationen bekommen eine Beatmung.
Das Gesundheitssystem war somit niemals auch nur annähernd gefährdet </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Harry, Du träumst doch nicht etwa immer noch von der Mondlandung  ?!? </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Wie kann man sich für Geld so verkaufen. Der Mann ist kein Mann der Wissenschaft sonder der Indoktrinierung. Tschüss Kanal </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 1> Stay safe everyone!
CC's available in Arabic, English, French, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Thai, Turkish and Vietnamese. Thanks to everyone who helps contribute and shares this video 🙏 </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> This is really sad that some people actually drank this stuff thinking it would save their lives.  The worst is bleach part. Trump should know better but doesn't care. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> A grown man really thought that was a good idea </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Darwin </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> That’s some very dangerous genes that could be spreading to the next generation.... </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> @Covid-19 1v1 me </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> If you drink isopropyl alcohol or bleach, you're just doing Darwin's work. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Did he blame Trump for his own stupidity? </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> How do people drink hand sanitiser and bleach? Surely the smell and initial taste from the first swig is enough to put them off? Do they have no sense of smell and taste? </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> This video is obviously fake! I drink two to three bottles of rubbing alcohol a day and I feel fine! </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Guys I drank a little bit of isopropyl alcohol wish me luck so I survive (no joke tho I thought of mixing no alcoholic champagne with isopropyl alcohol and drank it no joke) </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> so covid19 = sars2 mentioned in the video? </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> So if I'm understanding it correctly is to not drink the bleach rather snort it to get rid of covid-19 </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> And now you're blind </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> This is an extraordinarily bad idea... </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> You can thank that man who sits in the white house whose name rhymes with "rump" for things like this.  If you are not familiar with him he is the same guy who sends out tweets giving Covid 19 medical advice but he is not a doctor.  If he still does not sound familiar, you might recognize him as the guy who ordered tear gas to be shot at peaceful demonstrators (in memory of George Floyd) to clear his path for a "photo op".  

Yes ladies and gentlemen, that is our United States president I am talking about.  He is making America great again, one tweet at a time. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> It amazes me, as a 13 year old, that I have more common sense than people who are older than me. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> The fact someone did this just makes me feel better that even tho I never was able to go to college, I'm still not as dumb as these people. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> 6:50 you think it's over yet? Well we have "AC" who decided to do something even more dangerous </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 1> Insofar as I am concerned nCov19 sounds much better than SarsCOV2 </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> The reason I've not went outside is actually the brain-poking test being applied and you are telling me now I can simply take a dump? 🤣
Someone please help me write an essay to convince my government to do this! </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Hey guys, I have a science channel discussing new clinical research and would love if you could check it out - let me know what you think!? :) </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> I don't know if it can be done considering how fragile Sars - CoV-2 is (it doesn't infect mice, and it's hard to grow in a lab), but fecal occult blood tests are common at - home tests where swabs and packaging are sent in the mail along with instructions on how to properly take the sample.
If such testing can be successfully done in the home, perhaps a similar one can be done for Sars - CoV-2 as well. Perhaps a tube of medium could be included to inoculate with the swab sample in order to encourage growth of the virus.

Then again, if it requires a cell to hijack, this might be impossible to do. A virus is not a bacterium, after all. And if cells are included in the medium, it makes the package a biohazard, and I think that either the post office won't deliver it or there are special regulations for doing so.

But if you can find Sars - CoV-2 in sewage, there's got to be something in sewage to sustain the virus. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Um, who doesn't swallow their own spit? Less water I have to drink.

Also, I swallow my luggies all the time. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> I honestly thought this was going to talk about why some people need lots of toilet paper. </COMMENT 6>

<COMMENT 1> McDonalds workers=McSlaves </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> The hypocrisy, this demonstration of social awareness and caring drives me mad. If they really gave a shit maybe they could advice consumers that during this pandemic a healthier choice, full of vitamins and nutrients in order to boost your immune system is the way to go. But no, they do care. About their bottom line. And all these companies are doing the same, taking people for brainless idiots. Swallow the crap they shovel down your throat, over pay for it and keep smiling. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> McDonald's home of the none burger 🍔 lol you know that's not beef we were already risking our health 😂 we haven't eaten there in 2 years </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Pray for Trump's death folks! 🙏 </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> People of the world, Boycott Mac donald stay healthy ! </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> This should be in place as standard </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Normally I eat the ice cream cone (I m not sure it is the right word... I mean the cookie). Anyway, the guy here is touching it, bare hands. And then the woman puts a napkin on it...easy way to transmit it </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> WHAT A JOKE! This whole Covid thing is a big HOAX of a Joke. People wearing masks and social distancing look stupid and silly as F. All of this for a virus that has a 0.01% Death Rate. ABSOLUTE JOKE and CNN is an ABSOLUTE KLoWn show. </COMMENT 8>

<TAGS> None </TAGS>
<COMMENT 1> Marketing Mania vient de se fendre d'une vidéo en réponse à celle-ci (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOQ-VxQOKao), voici donc ma réponse à la sienne :
"Je vois que tu utilises ma vidéo pour en tirer plusieurs conclusions fausses, je prends le temps d'y répondre ici :

- la première étant que ma vidéo traite d’une théorie du complot : je n'ai jamais dit que les Etats ou une minorité de personnes ont volontairement créé les crises (ceci est un complot, comme ceux que tu présentes dans la première moitié de ta vidéo), mais que les crises sont des opportunités pour tous (à gauche comme à droite) de faire avancer rapidement leurs intérêts en profitant de la sidération que le choc crée dans la population, de la perte de repères (ceci est une analyse politique). En d'autres termes : Il n’y a PAS de complot néolibéral. Il y a une bataille des idées. L'agenda néoliberal a-t-il connu de rapides et profondes avancées à travers des crises récentes ? Oui. Et parfois aussi, l’agenda d’autres forces politiques : autoritaires, conservatrices, communistes, ...

- Ensuite ce qui me gêne, c'est être mis dans le même sac que ceux qui encouragent les théories du complot, être accolé, voir servir d'illustration à ce que tu décris dans la première moitié de la vidéo. Je combats les théories complotistes, ou plutôt je les évite plus qu'autre choses, elles m'insupportent même en cela qu'elles encouragent les gens à ne plus voir le monde comme une bataille politique des idées, mais comme déterminé, joué d'avance, hors de notre pouvoir d'agir. Nous, pauvres gens, on se serait que le dindon d'une farce. La conséquence est dramatique : on laisse faire, passif devant le jeu politique, attentiste d'une hypothétique fin dont on sortirait de toute façon perdant, qu'on lutte ou non. Tout le contraire de ce que je défends. Je suis inquiet de la direction que prend notre société, de ses fragilités, je suis en colère contre l'injustice qui la caractérise, et j'aimerais que cela change : le cœur de ma chaîne est de chercher, décrire les leviers de changement, et d'encourager qui le souhaite à s'en saisir. Je ne propose pas des analyses simples, faciles, simplifiées de la "réalité", au contraire. Ma chaîne vulgarise un paquet d'info, en croisant les sources, en donnant les arguments de chaque bord, qui n'ont rien à voir, ni de près ni de loin avec un complot, la dernière en date traite de la dette européenne : https://youtu.be/0dkyKR9zX04

- Rapidement sur les arguments sur la dette grecque : jamais je n’ai dit que les mesures néolibérales étaient passées “en douce” ou sans lien avec la dette. Par contre la façon de répondre à cette crise était un choix politique, qui a été largement contesté, qui aurait très bien pu se passer autrement qu’avec une crise d’austérité et une absence totale de solidarité européenne. Encore une fois, je détaille ça dans ma dernière vidéo : https://youtu.be/0dkyKR9zX04 où j’explique d’ailleurs qu’une dette d’un Etat n’a rien à voir avec celle d’un ménage, vu que tu fais ici la comparaison.

- Venons en à Milton Friedman : mon objectif était simplement de dire que certains, dont des économistes influents comme lui, sont parfaitement conscients du fait que les crises peuvent leur permettre de faire avancer leur agenda. Je parle de Friedman car il l’a même théorisé dans son livre (comme dans le camp d’en face Naomi Klein finalement). Et il s’agit effectivement d’une erreur de traduction sur le terme “imposé”. Si si : tu attribues une erreur de traduction à une volonté de trafiquer une information, c’est gênant quand c’est précisément ce que tu critiques. Je suis retourné voir mon script et il y a bien écrit “supposé” (plutôt que perçu) c’est à l’enregistrement de la voix off que j’ai mal lu. Mais surtout ma vidéo ne fait pas de Friedman le coeur de mon analyse, je ne dis même à aucun moment qu’il a menti comme tu le laisses penser. De là à résumer ma vidéo comme “un complot de l’ombre dont la seule preuve est une citation trafiquée”, c’est fort de café… 

- Sur Naomi Klein, je ne la mentionne que pour dire que le terme "stratégie du choc" vient de son livre (parce que si je ne l’avais pas fait, on m’aurait taclé tout pareil), mais je trouve que les faits et les liens de causalité du dit-livre laissent à désirer, précisément pour ce que tu précises sur Friedman et le renforcement de l’Etat par les crises, plutôt que son délitement. Il y a tout de même des éléments dont parle Naomi Klein prouvés autrement, par exemple sur la réaction Katrina, je te laisse lire cet article du monde diplomatique sourcé : https://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/2018/12/CYRAN/59367 

- Au final si j’étais taquin, je dirais que 5 des 7 points qui caractérisent les théories du complot selon toi se retrouvent précisément dans ta vidéo sur la partie où tu me prends en exemple : 
1/ des détails précis mais hors contexte. C’est exactement le cas sur la mini partie avec Friedman, où tu extrapoles plein de choses supposées à partir de détails de montage sur une simple parodie. 
2/ Sélectionner les bonnes infos : tu prends ma remarque sur le fait qu’une crise peut permettre à des Etats d’être plus autoritaires, pour défendre Friedman et dire que ce n’était pas sa volonté. Certes, mais ça n’a rien à voir, je parle de deux volets différents qui peuvent avancer en période de crise. Et j’ajoute qu’on peut être tout à fait être libéral économiquement et pratiquer des mesures de répression/contrôle fortes (Trump ou même Macron). De même à 22 minutes, par exemple, tu fais dire le contraire de ce que je développe dans ma vidéo, sur la privatisation des entreprises qui font des bénéfices, et la nationalisation les pertes.
3/ l’effet de spectacle : mettre ma tête en miniature, la musique angoissante pour marquer le complot ; … 
4/ attribuer des intentions néfastes : que j’aurais manipulé la traduction de Friedman par exemple 
5/ preuve par l’anecdote et la coïncidence : sur Friedman encore, mais aussi quand tu prends ma phrase sur le système de santé pour prouver que le libéralisme n’est pas le problème - sans parler de la partie où je développe et montre comment les politiques néolibérales en France ont précisément mis à mal notre système de santé. Partie où tu fais un lien très très direct entre taxation de l’économie et système de santé - alors que tu sais très bien que ça ne dit pas derrière la réalité des choix de financement de tel ou tel service public." </COMMENT 1>

<COMMENT 6> Je crois qu'il est plus que temps que les gens fasse valoir leurs droits en abolissant les classes sociales, à l'échelle nationale, comme Marx l'avait proposée, avant de se faire supplanter par le communisme et le capitalisme qui ne sont qu'une forme d'esclavagisme moderne quand on y pense! Je vous suggère les conférences de Noam Chomsky  et le projet venus de Jacques Fresco, de libre penseurs qui abonde dans ce sens, pour ceux que sa intéresse. Liberté,  égalité , fraternité, est une idéologie auquel la grosse majorité de la planète aspirent et pourtant ces dernières ont été étouffée par les  puissances économiques et politiques depuis! Pourquoi donc, s'il sont sensé représenté la majorité, je vous laisse parvenir à vos propres conclusions ? </COMMENT 6>

<COMMENT 11> Pris sur un autre forum mais tellement vrai ! :
Le pouvoir occulte mondial a un moyen bien plus efficace pour d’obtenir la confiance absolue de l’humanité : feindre la bienveillance à son égard. L’homme créé à l’image de Dieu intégre en lui l’innocente bonté de son créateur, et il a  été conçu pour faire totale confiance à toute personne qu’il perçoit comme lui voulant du bien. Il est dès lors très facile pour satan de le tromper, en simulant la bonté divine. Pourquoi insiste-t-on tellement sur les milliards dépensés pour compenser la crise actuelle ? Pour apparaître comme le bon, le sauveur, le héros. Satan de tous temps a engendré des catastrophes uniquement parce qu’il en avait besoin pour nous donner l’illusion de pouvoir nous sauver par l’entremise de ses serviteurs attitrés. Au dernières nouvelles 500 milliards de solidarité européenne pour sauver les peuples ! Quelle belle générosité ! 
Évidemment on oublie de dire que ce sera à celui qui reçoit de payer la note avec intérêts. Les grâces sataniques se reconnaissent immédiatement au fait qu’elles n’ont rien de gratuit ni bienveillant, ne résolvent rien et nous enfoncent toujours plus dans la déchéance morale, la soumission spirituelle, la dépendance matérielle et l’incarcération physique.
Tout à fait ; j’ai appelé ça la « béatitude matérielle ».
Jésus-Christ  promet aux hommes une béatitude spirituelle, qui conduit à la vie  éternelle et pousse l’homme à s’occuper de son prochain (par la charité). Satan promet aux hommes une béatitude matérielle, très avantageuse pour la vie selon la chair, mais conduisant à la mort éternelle. </COMMENT 11>

<COMMENT 7> The blame-China Wuhan lab conspiracy theories are not the only conspiracy theories... Always ask who is benefiting, or is attempting to benefit?.. China's economic rivals... If COVID-19 is a plandemic that is being blamed on China, then the October 2019 Military World Games would have been the ideal venue for anti-China western operatives to release the contagion, and have it quickly spread throughout the world, and China would be blamed for it because the virus [appears] to have come from Wuhan. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Cgtn is the most honest Channel in the world compared to all western countries Channels, keep blaming China for the origin of the Covid virus,.. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> You have one of the best ancestral medicine in the world if not the best, there's lots of alternative therapies to treat the virus which is going down and you still give this criminal association millions.
I really thought China would oppose the vaccine propaganda but your government has the same goal as the the globalists and have the same nazi, eugenic, control population agenda. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Probe is yet to took place in Wuhan by world committe 
Whether is it Lab virus or not 

Then do discussion  on how to safeguard  china by being isolated from the world </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> WHO's internal documents reveal China's 'cover-up' </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> No one needs ur 20 million - after releasing the CCP Virus on Mankind. How can anyone trust China. You kill your own ppl with vaccines developed by you. The world is well aware of your killer vaccines. You cannot be a part of any global solution. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> The Chinese Central Committee and the Chinese Communist Party are the best force for good in this world, please focus more on poverty alleviation and infrastructure development instead of over reacting to a virus that is no longer a problem.The global death toll is actually quite low, there is far less of a reason to stress out over this anymore. There are only 400,000 people dead in a world of 7 billion people because of the virus, that is only a 0.0001% fatality rate. Carrying around and using hand sanitizer is counter productive because it will lower your immunity over time. If a pesticide or herbicide will kill an insect or a plant, it will also do some damage to your own body as well. Masks are also counterproductive in the long run because they will increase the CO2 and other toxicity in the body and may cause other health problems in the future, its one thing if you are sick, then a mask is fine if you still need to go to work, but its not something healthy people should be asked to do all the time. The healthiest longest lived people on earth, are farmers who eat nutritious food, have strong families, live with their animals, and are not constantly running to western doctors, and sanitizing everything, case in point the Republic of Georgian and Abkhaizia.  We all can calm down. No live chickens or animals in markets may make sense in 北上广深 but it does not in smaller cities where refrigeration is difficult and expensive. Also, what about live fish? Please no vaccines they are poison and give people autism, please focus on Traditional Chinese Medicine. Vaccine science is not worth importing from the west. There are millions of autistic people in the USA now, I do not want that to happen in China. Please just ignore America, everything good in the world is coming from China, please keep up the good work and relax! </COMMENT 13>

<COMMENT 2> I started advocating for face masks for ordinary people in February- & even now in June wearing a face mask is frowned on in Florida. 
Medical Professionals need N95 but a 50 cent blue surgical mask worn by the ordinary person will provide a level of protection when social distancing is difficult. PROBLEM in USA - no PPE for our medical workers & finding a face mask of any type for seniors & at risk was impossible until recently. We were totally unprepared and our culture rejects wearing a face mask.  Hopefully that will change, but if we had adopted the preventive measures of South Korea & other Asia countries from the getgo, I believe our infections would not be topping 1.8 million with 300,000 deaths. Truly tragic. </COMMENT 2>

<COMMENT 2> Scientific evidence? </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> A dental office I worked in last week told me the KN95 came from Henry Schein. There was no Niosh and it was earloops from a small importer in New York. The box says it is being made for SHL Safety Inc of which has no website or internet presence. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Schein just wants to market themselves. Stop taking advantage of the dental profession during an emergency pandemic. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Need state testing, recommendations on implementation of appropriate air purification systems per square foot, certification of IAQC annually under DEEP like Radiation Certifications under DEEP. REGULATORY OVERSIGHT BY STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES. Every Office Must Comply by 2021. That’s what I’m advocating for all of us on a state and federal level. Take care of the aerosol issue and we are all set! </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> What about the circulation ( and recirculation) of air throughout the whole office by the AC system.  Are air purifiers of any value? </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Will you address how to contain aerosol at the site of its generation?  I've seen suction systems. </COMMENT 7>

<COMMENT 2> Unfortunately, the downloadable pattern/instructions are poor. Steps 1-3 tells you to sew the curves and then steps 4-5 instructs to sew the straight sides down but it looks like the straight sides are being sewn together making opening them up impossible. Please revise those instructions or consult both a beginner and a professional to make sure the instructions are correct and doable for beginners. </COMMENT 2>

<COMMENT 4> Thank you for this video and instructions. We're learning how to make these today, as a family, from Watford, UK. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Recommend a mask manufacturer, price: 0.14 USD / PCS, and only 7 USD for 50 PCS!! FDA test passed, which registration serial number is 10062936. You could confirm it on the FDA website, it’s ok for medical or surgical usage. Contact email: stephenyaftersale@ foxmail or website: superyouke.com.

I did some deep investigation and all the information from this supplier was in line with my requirements. This is the first mask manufacturer that has truly passed all tests and is willing to provide the original certificates since I have bought so many masks from different sellers on Amazon, who were either too expensive or too bad quality.

I ordered 50,000pcs and contacted the local UPS for delivery. It only took me a week to send me to STOCKTON, CA and my tracking number is 1Z5586Y20466890012.

The reason I ordered this amount of face masks is that we do have an urgent need for this. I have raised its price a little and made a little money for the spent time and energy. If this information is useful to you, please vote for me. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> I have been using this pattern with a small adjustment. I use the Face 1 & 2 (2 of each makes the front and inside). I use the Mouth peace to cut an interfacing from Pellon's Tyvek. Sew the Mouth peaces to the inside Face peaces. (This replaces having to change a filter) Tyvek is waterproof and breathable. The only place I have found to purchase it is JoAnn's. And I use hair bands purchased at the Dollar Stores for the ear peaces.
This makes a very nice mask that is comfortable to wear and it is washable. Tyvek says it should be air-dried. I had a lady tell me she washes her mask it the top shelf of her dishwasher. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Hard to see which side has the folded seam - Guess more experienced sewers would know.  Wish fabric had been one you could tell wrong side from right side so the seamed side would be more visible. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> First of all, I like the cute guy sewing. Secondly, I love this pattern because of the ease of access of this filter pocket. Other filter pockets in masks only have the opening on the top or one side and it makes it difficult to insert a filter and get it to sit in there properly. The design of this one makes it so easy, plus it's super easy to insert a nose wire and remove it to wash the mask! I wish I'd found this video sooner instead of trying a million other ones first. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> 3 ply mask 1.75 indian rs contact +91 6354702958 </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Mask takes longer than 5 to 10 minutes to sew.
The edited video is nearly 20 minutes and doesn't show cutting of pattern pieces.   Also I would recommend using clips instead of pins... creating less holes in the fabric for microns to pass through. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> In just 3 min you can learn this
https://youtu.be/eWzpbtQTqls </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> I may be missing the point but, besides saving a little bit of fabric, what is the advantage of the short cheek piece and the added complexity?  More commonly the cheek piece is cut the same shape and size as the outer piece, the mouth piece is cut and finished as in the video, all 3 pieces are then sewn all the way around.  That way you don´t have to worry about the correct overlap of the short cheek and mouth pieces.  Less work and you still end up with the same filter pocket, the same access for inserting a nose wire, and the added benefit of 3 layers of fabric in front of the mouth instead of just 2 layers. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Is there a good way to enlarge this for a man's face? This fits me perfect but doesn't quite fit his face. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> It is a good idea to wear a cloth face mask when you are around others during COVID-19. We cover our faces to protect others, a cloth face covering is an act of compassion. In other words, no reason not to. They can be comfortable and, look awesome. </COMMENT 14>

<COMMENT 3> Bonjour je suis fier du résultat et je pense que le professeur Raoul  doit profiter de cette crise pour démasquer le mansonge sur le VIH
Je que le professeur connais aussi le traitement pour libérer des milliers de personnes sous ARV </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Et les familles des victimes attendent la fin de cette épidémie pour trainer les responsables au gouvernement en justice </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Les tests engagés par l'état de l'hydroxychloroquine ne suivent pas le même processus tels que le professeur Raoult les préconisent. Les autorités parlent déjà qu'ils seront négatifs alors qu'ils n'ont pas le résultat final. En effet comme l’espèce de ministre qu'on a l'a affirmé, il autorise le traitement mais Uniquement pour les cas Graves, alors que le professeur Raoult a bien précisé que ce traitement ne faisait que réduire voir stopper la prolifération du virus dans notre corps et donc évitait la contamination entre patients ce qui enrayerait la maladie, et qu'il devait être administré au début de la maladie et si possible dès sa détection. Le traitement ne fonctionneras pas dans ce sens. Donc Encore un gros foutage de gueule, ceci n'est plus de l'incompétence, c'est Volontaire, cela fait bien partie d'un Plan. </COMMENT 5>

<COMMENT 1> Me gustaría saber qué va a pasar y cómo van a manejar el asunto de los aires acondicionados en empresas, centros comerciales, etc., a los cuales generalmente no les dan mantenimiento y no los limpian y sólo circulan una y otra vez aire sucio; y también quiero saber qué pasará con las oficinas en donde todo el espacio está cerrado, no tienen ventilación natural y precisamente hay puro aire acondicionado, pues en ese tipo de espacios se vicia mucho el aire, como comúnmente dicen "huelen a humanidad". </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Primero que nada, no he visto a Blanquita Valadez y a otros pseudo periodistas groseros y mentirosos en las conferencias y la verdad ¡¡¡¡¡qué bueno!!!! Gracias a Dios que se omitan, no hacen falta para nada. Sigan quedándose en su casa porfa!!! Ah! Y omítanse de los medios de comunicación porque la verdad no aportan nada de valor. </COMMENT 2>

<COMMENT 6> Las barreras mismas pueden ser un foco de infección que ni en las mismas unidades del IMSS se han implementado, ni entre los  mismos pacientes ni en las oficinas ni en los escritorios de las clínicas, hospitales ni oficinas del seguro. Sean congruentes para que se les pueda creer señores. </COMMENT 6>

<COMMENT 4> I have a popular virus prevention and control idea, which can be achieved only by developing a mobile phone software. There is no need for a large number of police to retrieve camera records to track those who are potentially infected!

 The local area signal is enabled by default on the mobile phone, and the distance between the two mobile phones is 0.5 meters, which leaves a connection record in the software of the two mobile phones.  The duration of historical records is the epidemic incubation period.  In this way, everyone's mobile phone has a record of contact with others for a period of time.  These records are usually useless, but when one of them is diagnosed with an epidemic, those mobile phones that have been in contact with him for 0.5 meters in the past period automatically show that they are close contacts.

 ‪In addition, according to the doctor's inference of the patient's infection time, the date length of the 0.5-meter sensor record can be adjusted in the mobile phone epidemic contact tracking software to accurately obtain the data of all potential infected people who have been in close contact with him.  This is my idea for epidemic prevention and control.  There is no need to allow a large number of police to retrieve camera records to track the infected person. </COMMENT 4>

<COMMENT 1> J'espère que la vidéo vous plaira, j'ai essayé de faire un condensé des points importants sur cette épidémie et surtout appuyé sur l'importance des règles d'hygiène, et notamment pourquoi elles sont importantes. Si vous n'avez rien appris avec ma vidéo je suis pour une fois content, ça voudra dire que vous avez compris l'enjeu actuel. bon visionnage et faites attentions a vous ! </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Encore une excellente vidéo, très pertinente, et vraiment d'utilité publique. Merci à toi pour le travail de fou que tu fournis. </COMMENT 2>

<COMMENT 5> ON EST DÉCONFINÉ !!!! et en vie 😂😂 </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Crise économique... 
Perte de confiance envers le gouvernement... 
Économie qui passe devant la santé...

Moi je dit après le covid 19 le monde va changer profiter de vos proches on sait jamais </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Moi c’est pas le corona virus qui m’a fait peur, mais les gens. 
Regarder en Amérique il ont commencé à acheter des armes. 
Pourquoi ? Alors la aller leur demandez. 
Ou encore ( là je rigole pas c’est vraiment vrai ), les forces de l’ordre observent nos moindres déplacement, parce que comme des idiots, ont mais sur Facebook : est regarder aujourd’hui je suis ici. 
Ah oui et l’école. 
enfaite les enfants ont les prends pour des fourmis. 
On leur fais un carré, et on leur dit: ne dépasse pas se carré. 
C’est inquiétant pour leurs sociabilisation avec les autres personnes. 
Enfaite ont leurs apprend à devenir insociable. 
Le président. 
Rhooo sa va il a dit comme pour cernoville ( je sais pas comment ça s’écrit ), il a pas le passeport, il peut pas passer les frontières. Mais bien sûr.
😑eh bien voilà maintenant ou ont en est. 
Est le gouvernement il va se servir comme excuse du coronavirus, de rajouter des restrictions ridicules. Comme la liberté d’expression des chaîne YouTube, ex: byoblu. Qui t’informe sur des choses, qu’à la télé tu n’entendra jamais . 
Et bien sûr il essaye par tout les moyen de les fermer c’est chaîne YouTube .
Bon il y’en a tellement, elles vont pas se fermer de si tôt .
Enfaite, je ne veux pas vous critiquer puisque je me critique moi même,
Ont a été un peu trop crédules sur se coup là. 
Ons est même pas sûre que le de nombre de mort est vrai. Même si ( il a été approuvé par un étudiant de Harvard )
Il y’en a qui peut même être mort d’autre chose.
Ne me critiquer pas. 
Juste donner votre avis, faite vous votre opinion de cette situation.
Est c’est pas pour gratter des likes, c’est juste pour donné mon point de vue. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> "Nous serons en confinement total pendant 2 semaines comme en Italie" BAHAHAHA ça fait 2 mois :issou: </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Tu balayes bcp de théories dans l'intro sans arguments c'est pas un travail d'enquête ça </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Toi qui a déjà produit une très bonne vidéo sur Casasnovas, serait-il possible de parler du cancer que lui et ses pôtes (Schaller, Crèvecoeur, etc...) sont en train de répandre sur internet? Je suis extrêmement inquiète de voir les absurdités qu'ils répandent être adoptées et partagées par des gens, hier encore, raisonnables...
Ces malades ont gagné une audience phénoménale pendant le confinement. Si toi tu t'attaques au sujet, ça pourrait contre-balancer... </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> à quand ep 2 sur le déconfinement ? </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> nautre  gouvernement  c'est  de la merde  wola  on dit  au  français  de respect  les  distance   de sécurité alors  que personne  respecte les disance   de sécurité  alors  que  le  peuple  sans  branle   notre gouvernement  est  torp  lacsicte   on est foutu  c'est moi qui  vous le dit    le peuple  français  sont  cons  on leur  dit de respecter  les  règles   le  peuple  fais  tout  le  contraire  
est il bon nous  enculer  a  sec  le 11 mais    on est foutu  c'est moi qui  vous le  dit   parceque  le peuple est  cons (des putin  de moutons) pour la plus pare .... </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Loll Arrête c'est juste une grippe pas la peste noire... Comme à chaque grippe saisonnière il y a des morts c normal malheureusement. La question est de savoir s'ils vont nous mettre tous en confinement à chaque fois qu'il y a une grippe... Ou à chaque soulèvement social important. "Un peuple qui est prêt à sacrifier un peu de liberté pour un peu de sécurité ne mérite ni un ni l'autre et finira par perdre les deux." -Benjamin Franklin </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Etant dans le milieu médical et paramédical, j'ai accès directe de ce qu'il se passe dans les hôpitaux, laboratoires, cliniques....etc par des collègues ou des amis. Je peux vous assure que même si vous êtes jeune et en bonne santé, le virus ne vas pas vous épargnez pour autant. Pensez à votre entourage mais aussi aux personnel soignants qui sont se sacrifie littéralement pour la population qui semble s'en foutre complètement. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> ce qui est egoiste cest de reduire la qualité de vie de 8 milliard de personne pour quelques personne a risque, cest eux le probleme pas nous </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Tu avais raison en vrai </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> merci de ta vidéo, c'est là ou l"on voit la mentalité de la plus part des français qu'ils ne regardent que leur propre nombril,car oui cette épidémie va faire très mal en santé et économiquement  car pour certaines personnes le confinement durera jusqu'à l'apparition d'un traitement et l'économie risque de mettre pas mal de temps à reprendre ,c'est pire que le crac boursier de 2007 et cela touche le monde entier les frontières ne seront pas ouvertes sitôt,et la seule préoccupation de nos concitoyen c'est de pouvoir partir en vacances cet été et que les bars et restaurants ré-ouvrent,enfin merci à toi mais pour l'instant j'ai du mal avoir la sortie du tunnel à+ </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Je m'eppelle Mathilde on on s'en fou ai 11 ans j'ai même pas commencer ma vie que on doi plus sortir et pire les enfant qui vienne de n'être 😂😂😂😂 </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> OK le virus à pris une ampleur énorme au niveau mondial depuis ce temps, c'est impressionnant
Cependant quand on regarde les statistiques et le profil des personnes ayant des symptomes graves voir des personnes décédés, je n'ai pas vraiment peur de l'attraper.
Je respecte bien évidemment les règles de confinement et d'hygiène pour mes proches et pour les autres, mais ce virus ne me fait pas stresser... </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> J'ai 10 ans et je suis diabètique esque je devrais avoir peur ne plus sortir 😷🤔 </COMMENT 20>

<TITLE> The Great Ventilator Fiasco of COVID19 | Are They Even Needed? Doctor Explains </TITLE>

<TIMESTAMP> 2020-04-24T13:46:41Z </TIMESTAMP>
<DESCRIPTION> First we're told we need thousands of ventilators. Now they might be hurting more than helping? How does this relate to the biggest challenge facing science ... </DESCRIPTION>
<TAGS> ['Medlife Crisis', 'Medicine', 'Science', 'Education', 'Comedy', 'Doctor', 'Cardiology', 'Medical School', 'Coronavirus', 'Ventilators', 'COVID-19', 'Donald Trump', 'Djokovic', 'Goop', 'Gwyneth Paltrow', 'Tesla', 'SpaceX', 'Dunning Kruger', 'Uncertainty', 'Medical error', 'Intubation', 'Intensive Care', 'Overconfidence', 'Ventilator', 'CPAP', 'hydroxychloroquine', 'Cardiologist', 'Health'] </TAGS>
<COMMENT 1> We've been wasting our time with ventilators when all we needed was Dettol down our throats and a UV torch up the bum. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> There are experts and there are those that although knowledgeable in one field believe that they are experts in all fields , like Mr Musk.
Even God is not an expert in all matters scientific . Those oral/nasal pharyngeal airways can cause other problems and are normally restricted to emergency scenarios where the patient cannot be hospitalised like on a battlefield for instance . Hospitalised patients now get technically advanced non invasive equipment where ever possible these days to eliminate other problems . The mere notion that this sort of kit killed Covid patients is absolutely ridiculous .The inability of the lungs to transfer oxygen from the air supply by the lungs thus starving the part of the brain that controls involuntary body functions like breathing and heart beat killed the people on ventilators because the embolisms caused by the virus in the lungs and veins restricted the gaseous exchange to the point where the breathing and heart stops from lack of brain function . 
Hey but anything to kick up!a shit storm , it would seem ! Take a couple of courses in Human Biology and Biomechanics and then come up with a theory not regurgitate crap from a complete idiot , try thinking for yourselves for a change , there are no dangerous side effects !
During WW2 the US was pretty backward in aircraft engine design and many other fields of engineering which is why Churchill agreed to hand over British intellectual property to the US to get them up to speed with , powerful supercharged in line piston engines which reduced frontal area ( the US had one the pathetic Allison V12 all others being radial) , ,jet engines , metallurgy to build these , nuclear fission from ICI project White , and so on . The tech they received created the technology boom post war USA as mass production was their strength . Hence Packard ( owned by Daimler) began building Rolls Royce Merlin's . Elco building Paine's British Power Boats design and so on .
Assisted breathing non invasive ventilators have been in production for many years and several designs both portable and bedside are available . Once again the mistake was made to enrol companies with no experience to build them instead of obtaining access to existing tried and trusted deigns of both types . More or less the Chinese way of mass production without the need to buy an SU35 from Russia and try to reverse engineer (copy) the engines without the knowledge of metallurgy to make them function reliably.
This haphazard method results in the Typical US NATO approach of let's adopt the 7.62 cartridge so all nations gear up for interchangeability , then a year later reaiize its no good and start using 5.56 , so everyone else has to follow suit . Lucky we didn't do that until 1985 as we would have almost certainly lost the Falklands War .
This kind of knee jerk mentality and reaction must end in such situations and the Churchillian approach taken , what have we got , what do we need , can we make more but quicker , and NOT send everything out to tender to businesses not even remotely connected with the requirements and expect great results instantly . That is pretty dumb. I'm glad Dyson wasn't included as there may have been patients with their insides on the outside ! </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> You mean the Wuhan virus, does China have you in their back pocket too? Did you forget China willingly spread their disease to the world? </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> How about the ICU delirium from the “light sedation”?  Could it be that patients are giving up? </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> 1 will end up in ICU/ITU, 10 will be strongly symptomatic, 700 will not even know they had it.   More than 80% of the population has had it and not ended up in medical crisis... because they eat right, drink sufficient CLEAN water and get enough rest in a humidity saturated environment. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Putting patients prone was done in 1917... it wasn't invented by some living twit.  It was done more than 2000 years ago. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> ... presumed? no, *ass*umed it would behave like non-coronaviruses... do you have any clue how impossible it is to get people to use chlorine sterilization because they're trained that alcohol sterilizes?   Alcohol doesn't sterilize viruses at all.

Covid19 is also transmissible as a "fallout" like dust, negative pressure on masks often just atomizes the droplets we hear about to the point that the virus transpires into the respiration...  there's so much going on here caused by ignorance.

In fact NIOSH stated clearly in 2003? that their standards do not include SARS because they were never intended to be used for viruses yet in sixteen fucking years nobody has actually done ANY work on sub 0.300 micron respiration equipment.   Covid19 being 0.128 microns and *not actually alive* it can penetrate right through the masks in a viable form.   Drying Covid19 out doesn't 'kill' it because it isn't actually alive either.     While the mask greatly reduces the viral body load intake of the person wearing it it DOES NOT stop the intake.  I've caught the damned thing at least twice now while wearing indirectly sheltered remote twin Sundstrom P100 PAPR inside a backpack functioning only on respiratory intake (motor off) because I have immunocompromized asthma, which means that live virus is flying right through those filters... behind fiber cards of higher density than cloth, behind the dust settling baffles, behind a 600 thread pillowcase wrapped around the PAPR inside a high density nylon backpack with the zipper locked closed.   I'm literally wearing more protection than 100% of the population and still occasionally catching the virus, clearly not from moisture droplets in the air.    The hubric ignorance of the morons who should be paying attention to the scientific method when they're just working on presumptions of knowledge should be rewarded with requirements to re-certify their degrees.   My case with my immunological problem is very very special and edge, my asthma is highly uncommon even in the asthma community and I suffer greatly from negative pressure - an actual N100 face mask could give me pneumonia if I wore it for 1 hour.   One factual exception ruins a theory.

Governments need to spend money on developing *better* filtration equipment for medical personnel.  We need 0.050 micron absolute standards and manufacture immediately - not bullshit low MERV rating "HEPA" equipment that requires 10 to 12 circulatory passes to filter out even 0.3 micron particles. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> I'm not a doctor, but have the right to use the title doctor. I'm a lawyer, but I should have just stayed home and watched Law & Order. That's enough to give legal advice that's much better than mine. Or just ask the neighbors. No need for a legal degree and almost 20 years experience. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> In Germany people are trying to build a little more sophisticated makeshift ventilators and are trying to actually get them certified
https://xn--diy-beatmungsgert-5qb.de </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> It's just that science isn't magic. So many people desperately want to believe in something, and they suspect that they are being cheated out of it by 'science'. Science is simply critical thinking, and one can only hope that we are teaching that in primary school. It is the essence of being human, after all. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> My favourite conpiracy theory phrase starts with "I don't see how such and such can be true, they must be (taking over the world) ...". I try to tell them that after saying that they can't understand something they should stop. They have already said enough. They can't  see that too though. Amazing what conspiracy nuts can see and can't see! </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Appeal to authority is a common fallacy as evidenced within. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> There is an alternative to ventilators.  It's called death.   My hospital is getting short of ventilators,  shall we try it?  ICU RN, Texas, USA </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Seems like Elon Mask has a difference in opinion on ventilation! 🤣 </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> It's confirmed hydroxychloroquine study data was faked as a political hit job by Sergisphere. Not fake, not a conspiracy "theory," but an actual conspiracy. Sergisphere is a U.S. company. Time to choose, Dr. or politics. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> It's crazy, all the different theories and issues we are having with covid...that is why I'm still wearing my tinfoil (aluminium) hat just in case. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> I like your videos.  When you talked about seat belts and accidents, if we put a driver in the most exposed place of his car so he is hit first on the next bind corner.  How is he going to enter that corner?   I think it might be with very great care.  
Now put him in a safety cell, strapped in and secure will he exercise quite the same care? Possibly not.

Its all a balance for sure and getting it right is difficult, at one time the motor bike and sidecar was seen to be the least likely to be involved in an insurance claim.  The drivers were driving an unstable machine, but very concerned for their family in the outfit. Insurance premiums were very very low. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> A real shame to see you call veganism a "strange dietary neurosis". </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Like you, dear doctor, I whole-heartedly agree with Elon—except where I don't. But you didn't even get to the worst comments from Elon. His latest appearance on Joe Rogan, where he essentially says a large portion of Covid-19 deaths are really from other causes, is the biggest pile of obscurantist crap I've heard in a while. And believe me, as a watcher of energy technologies and climate issues, I've seen some real piles of crap. As best I can tell, the best retort to Musk's claims in this area comes from looking at all-cause mortality. Getting meaningful indications about this requires an overall death rate high enough to stand out against the noise. Here in the US this spring we had, unfortunately, just such a situation in certain areas, with NYC of course topping the bunch. And as best I could tell, when that was looked at, there were actually overall death, from all causes, about 50% MORE than the official reports of Covid-19 deaths.
Or have I got this wrong somewhere? </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 1> Hi! This was very informative and the information is still applicable it seems (June 4). Thanks.

I had COVID19 type symptoms in mid-March, though I tested negative. Don't know if it was just out of my system or I had something else. Anyway,  this information prompted me to be sure to use asthma medications (inhaled): corticosteroid to keep inflammation down.  My physician eventually put me on Montelukast, which is great for me.

Just FYI for anyone reading: I use a tracking device on my rescue inhaler (Propeller). It is free from the site (Google Propeller). A phone app allows you to track triggers, frequency and it even gives reminders for you to take/use medications.

  The graphs it created of my rescue Inhaler use since August 2019 (hardly used) showed how much more often I needed it in March. I shared these with my doctor. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> He's incredible. I wish more people would listen </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> <COVID-19 TRUTH>
*Most people won’t get the virus.*
*Most of the people who get it won’t display symptoms.*
*Most of the people who display symptoms will only be mildly sick.*
*Most of the people with severe symptoms will never be critically ill.*
*And most of the people who get critically ill will survive.*

This is borne out by the numerous serological studies which show, again and again, that the infection fatality ratio is on par with flu.
( https://swprs.org/studies-on-covid-19-lethality/ )
There is no science – and increasingly little rational discussion – to justify the lockdown measures and overall sense of global panic.
Nevertheless, it’s always good to get official acknowledgement of the truth, even if it has to be leaked.
Here are three leaks showing that those in power know that the coronavirus poses no threat, and in no way justifies the lockdown that is going to destroy the livelihoods of so many.
1. “IT’S ALL BULLSHIT!”
On May 26th Dr Alexander Myasnikov, Russia’s head of coronavirus information, gave an interview to former-Presidential candidate Ksenia Sobchak in which he apparently let slip his true feelings.
( https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/05/27/its-all-bullsht-russias-coronavirus-information-chief-says-of-virus-fears-a70398 )
Believing the interview over, and the camera turned off, Myasnikov said:
It’s all bullshit […] It’s all exaggerated. It’s an acute respiratory disease with minimal mortality […] Why has the whole world been destroyed? That I don’t know,”

<COMMENT 5> Someone says to us corona virus is nothing but a kind of a flu. Today I have really, truly understood that is not the case. It,s a very much dangerous  disease against which we have to be alert as much as possible, because it will causes  ARDS to us, and which will be seriously critical for us.  You are great!!! Today, on May 30,  2020, I have watched your video clip. Thank YOU from Japan. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> I’m watching this on 31st May and everything he said 2 months back is exactly what’s happening now! I hope in India things get better really soon.
Thanks for the important info Doc. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> i got the virus and am afraid it's gonna kill me here overseas, 😭 😭 </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Thanks for this vital important information dr. Vuong this is some serious times we are living in we need people like you to tell us the truth about this virus. Please keep bringing us this important information.stay safe and stay blessed.😊🙂🤔 </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> This guy is JOKE </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Now India has 166K COVID19 case. The USA has 1.76M </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Ominous to see this once we actually have reached 1 million cases. Thank you for getting information out there! </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Man! You were so damn wrong. It was not 20K people died bc of this virus like u said. The number just passed 100K. I got a feeling that US government intentionally let the virus spread wildly to weed out the old, the weak and the sick to reduce the cost of health care. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Dr. what is your opinion on the patent list which follows (includes implications)  . .from Alfred Lambremont Webre’s research, a list of patents from the last decade:

US7220852B1 Modified Human Corona virus. Holder: CDC. 2003
(our own govt Center for Disease Control)

US20060257852A1 SARS Holder: Glaxosmithkline 2004
(Pharmaceutical company)

US8343506B2 Chimeric Chikunguya virus Holder University of Texas. 2010

US10130701B2 Corona virus chimeric genetic manipulation Holder Pirbright Inst. 2014

EP3172319B1 VACCINE for Corona virus Holder: Pirbright Inst. 2014. (Pirbright Inst. funded by Bill and Melinda Gates Fdn.)

WO200806347A2 Nanobots RF A! control of humans. Holder: Neil Solomon 2006.

Okay summary ...
On these patents, some are obvious, some you have to read between the lines... but the purpose is to show irrevocably that technology exists and that things have been done that are denied and lied to the public by the Mainstream Media (MSM)

A) So here is proof the virus was a bioengineered weapon 😎
B) That the law was broken to develop "gain of function" by Chimeric research
C) That a vaccine already existed before the COVID19 outbreak. 
D) that Nanobots are in the vaccines.
E) that nanobots are being sprayed thru aerosols (Chemtrails)
F) that these nanobots can be programmed to kill someone very rapidly
G) that these are/can be activated and controlled by (EMF) Electromagnetic energy Radio/microwave transmission - i.e. 5G technology.
H) that A.I. (Artificial Intelligence) control can/will be initiated thru these means.
I) that the coming crypto- currency will depend on you having the bots, and will monitor your every move. etc, etc etc....

<COMMENT 1> so sad ,hurt </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> This is what make America a country full of racist people. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> What about thousands of American citizen and green card holders medical graduates delivering pizza, working as a waitress driving for UBER, LFYT, who are being denied medical residency training that were replaced by foreign medical graduates . </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> That sucks! </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> The reason they gave her: you provide no unique value to the United States. 

The real reason why the denied her a green card: ‘’ bitch you ugly and you look like a terrorist so nah thanks’’ </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> America sucks. That is.. USA. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> WTF?? </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> The reason she wasn't issued a green card is because the new administration has drastically cut the number of green cards for H1B visas, which seems that she falls in to. Citizens of specific countries, predominantly India were applying and getting a high number of H1B visas and once they arrived, changed that into a green card and stayed. When the new administration took the grabs on power, it didn't only not like immigration, but also saw the number of H1B to green card converts, which in itself seems a betrayal. The entire scenario may have played a role in not issuing green card to this physician since the numbers have been dramatically cut/. This also means, a model from another country may get a green card because there may not be so many who have applied yet. Her lawyer can petition and request the USCIS to give a detailed response as to why she wasn't issued a green card! </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> WHY ON EARTH WOULD YOU FIGHT TO STAY IN THE U.S?? I MEAN, CANADA? EUROPE?  You help their people and they deny you entrance. Screw them. Seriously. Screw them. They don't deserve you. </COMMENT 9>

<COMMENT 14> I am sure that if America doesn’t want her, Australia would welcome her with open arms.  But I am sure America will accept her and once again Trump will have to eat humble pie. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Why should we be praising the president and Karens and Kevins who demand haircuts, guns, Starbucks when we should be praising these poor healthcare workers who are working their asses off and putting themselves in mortal danger to keep us safe?
And this is the thanks they get. "Go to China" "My rights" "My gun rights" "Commie". 
Karens and Kevins, theses are the same people who gave you advice on how to lose your blubber and help you stay fit  in your bathing suit so that you'll show off your body at the beach right now. And telling them to go to China is your way of saying thank you? Oh please...

It's like how Trump insulted POWs. They were in mortal danger and he victim blames them. This is why I'm losing faith in this country. </COMMENT 15>

<COMMENT 1> Diversity of thought 😂😂😂😂 </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> After seeing this and people not listening to the governments advice and also knowing that mass protesting have been currently happening in all cities throughout the UK including Glasgow and Birmingham, Manchester, etc and since some of the protesters have not been wearing a face mask and keeping socially distance. It is obvious that the UK needs to be prepared for a second wave of COVID 19 within the next few weeks :-( I feel sorry for the people who work for the NHS. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Jobs should be given on merit NOT ethnic backgrounds, that was one of labour's many failures </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> “Were one the most of the most tolerant societies “ theres something about the word tolerant that doesn’t quite sit well with me. The assumption seems to me to be that, there is a people that are inherently inferior... and given that inherent inferiority we’re the best at putting up with it... theres racism in that very statement.

<COMMENT 9> its definitely got nothing to do with   Cummings, sending the schools back  or weak messaging at all </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> In other words: Brexit is going to destroy the UK and we need to sign a trade deal with the USA, so don't show us up and embarrass Trump by protesting. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Stephen Lawrence decent guy who added something to society was a sad day for us brits. American George Floyd drug dealing, wife abusing low life, no biggie. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> I decided not to attend because it wasn't worth the risk – I've been to 4 protests to date and my experience is that they were very large gatherings. I'm hoping to participate in a vaccine trial very soon and testing positive for COVID-19 would preclude that.

But let's not forget that Dominic Cummings and Peter Gibson (Tory MP for Darlington) may have become super-spreaders in the North due to breaching self-isolation rules when displaying symptoms. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> I like the way Matt speaks. I agree, i think the way we are brought up & how we are taught these things, this happens in every culture. i know Education is key for everything but we let hatred get in the way & respect is thrown out of the window. Humans only can accept each other once we are responsible & fair to one another, mentally, physically, emotionally. </COMMENT 13>

<COMMENT 17> There's racism in every walk of life and to deny there isn't is a lie. We all know Hancock is economical with the truth and Johnson is more economical still. He's notorious for his racist, homophobic and sexist remarks and attitude. </COMMENT 17>

<COMMENT 1> message de Didier Rahoult aujourd'hui le 8 avril  @ </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Le ministre de la MORT veut attendre 2 semaines de plus. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Bonjour je suis fier du résultat et je pense que le professeur Raoul  doit profiter de cette crise pour démasquer le mansonge sur le VIH
Je que le professeur connais aussi le traitement pour libérer des milliers de personnes sous ARV </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Et les familles des victimes attendent la fin de cette épidémie pour trainer les responsables au gouvernement en justice </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Les tests engagés par l'état de l'hydroxychloroquine ne suivent pas le même processus tels que le professeur Raoult les préconisent. Les autorités parlent déjà qu'ils seront négatifs alors qu'ils n'ont pas le résultat final. En effet comme l’espèce de ministre qu'on a l'a affirmé, il autorise le traitement mais Uniquement pour les cas Graves, alors que le professeur Raoult a bien précisé que ce traitement ne faisait que réduire voir stopper la prolifération du virus dans notre corps et donc évitait la contamination entre patients ce qui enrayerait la maladie, et qu'il devait être administré au début de la maladie et si possible dès sa détection. Le traitement ne fonctionneras pas dans ce sens. Donc Encore un gros foutage de gueule, ceci n'est plus de l'incompétence, c'est Volontaire, cela fait bien partie d'un Plan. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Ce que l'on voit est la realite mais ce que l'on nous dit est un mensonge . </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> On parle que la 5g pourrait être le responsable de ce virus </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Vous êtes fou si ca marche pourquoi le monde est parslyser? Les francais sont tèlement idiot ils croivent à m' importe quoi. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Ministre de la santé est un gros tocard il a utiliser une fake news pour discréditer la chloroquine en disant qu’il y avait eu un mort au usa alors que sait faux ce gouvernement a jeter à la poubelle </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Ce professeur est soit considéré comme le diable soit comme un dieu. Bon, il faudrait peut-être trouver un juste milieu. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Vivement le grand ménage de tous ces incompétents. Ils vont avoir bcp de morts sur le dos et devront rendre des comptes </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Les journalistes d'RMC qui se croient à l'abri de la colère du peuple dans leur tour d'ivoire...
Vous allez, comme le gouvernement prendre très cher quand cette merde sera terminée.
Allez tous vous faire enculer </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> y'a 1 témoignage, n'en faisont pas une réalité.
"J'ai le COVID-19, et j'ai étais soigné en 6 heures en mangeant le bois de mon escalier " peut-on en faire une généralité ? , va t-on prescrire du bois aux infectés ? un témoignage seul ne vaut rien. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> 15 jour c est environs ( 5 jour x 250 mort/jour  [=1250]     ).   +    (5 jour x    550 mort/jour   [ =2750]      ).    +    (5 jour     x     800  [ = 4000   ).    =   8000  +   les 1300 (deja mort )      =9300         sans compté les malade décedé en EHPAD et a domicle  ne son pas comptabilisé      dans 15 jours c est possible qu soit autour  10.000  mort. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> 15 jour pour etudié comment decrediliser son medicament surtout </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Le ministre de la santé veut attendre 20 000 morts supplémentaires pour donner son feu vert. Dans le même temps il y aura tellement de demande, l'Inde par exemple que le traitement ne sera plus disponible. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> C’est bien beau mais mtn faut trouver un vaccin </COMMENT 17>

<COMMENT 1> Me gustaría saber qué va a pasar y cómo van a manejar el asunto de los aires acondicionados en empresas, centros comerciales, etc., a los cuales generalmente no les dan mantenimiento y no los limpian y sólo circulan una y otra vez aire sucio; y también quiero saber qué pasará con las oficinas en donde todo el espacio está cerrado, no tienen ventilación natural y precisamente hay puro aire acondicionado, pues en ese tipo de espacios se vicia mucho el aire, como comúnmente dicen "huelen a humanidad". </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Primero que nada, no he visto a Blanquita Valadez y a otros pseudo periodistas groseros y mentirosos en las conferencias y la verdad ¡¡¡¡¡qué bueno!!!! Gracias a Dios que se omitan, no hacen falta para nada. Sigan quedándose en su casa porfa!!! Ah! Y omítanse de los medios de comunicación porque la verdad no aportan nada de valor. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Ir al CINE ES PRIORITARIO!!!!!!! </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> QUÉDATE EN CASA . No corras riesgos innecesarios.. Evita el contagio mental con prevención , higiene y buena Nutricion </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> No me queda claro en semáforo en verde es cuando regresan los niños a la escuela.... entonces dice todas esas medidas para que son ? Si no hay clases con semáforo rojo naranja y amarillo; Lieog dice que en semáforo en verdee podemos salir al cine etc ya no entendí!!!!!! </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Las barreras mismas pueden ser un foco de infección que ni en las mismas unidades del IMSS se han implementado, ni entre los  mismos pacientes ni en las oficinas ni en los escritorios de las clínicas, hospitales ni oficinas del seguro. Sean congruentes para que se les pueda creer señores. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Señor secretario de salud es imperativo haya un médico en todas y cada una de las escuelas. Ojalá el señor presidente de la Nación tome cartas en el asunto. </COMMENT 7>

<COMMENT 15> Es pregunta : porque  El Dr. Gatell y todos incluyemdo a nuestro  Sr. Presidente No usan Cubrebocas? Se creen inmunes o que? </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Esto dijo el Dr. Lopez Gatell el 5 de mayo 2020: Se estima que se registrarán alrededor de 6,000 muertes por coronavirus en México. 
Esto publiqué en esta pagina de youtube de Conferencia de Prensa Covid 19 el 28 de marzo: EL 28 DE MAYO DEL 2020 COLAPSARÁ EL SISTEMA DE SALUD EN MÉXICO POR LAS PÉSIMAS Y TARDÍAS DECISIONES DEL GOBIERNO. INDICARÁN QUE HAY 86,200 INFECTADOS. Disculpen me equivoque por 26 horas. </COMMENT 16>

<TITLE> Medical journal retracts study on hydroxychloroquine for Covid-19 treatment </TITLE>

<DESCRIPTION> A medical journal has retracted an influential study which claimed the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine may increase heart problems in Covid-19 patients. </DESCRIPTION>

<COMMENT 2> Anything to Kill Trump's career. How sad. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> How stupid.  If you go to a country with Malaria, they prescribe this drug.  It’s been SOP to give this drug to soldiers going into malaria-borne areas.  If there was a significant danger,  everyone would know about it 30 years ago. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> "Deja vu all over again" for Lancet. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> NYC doctors had great result with this but were silenced. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Surgisphere is the culprit </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> SHAME ON AUTHORS AND JOURNALS FOR NOT CHECKING DATA </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> They don't care who they take down as long as they can cause uncertainty and havoc before November...it sickens me to watch my country be ripped by idiots that have no backbone and want to push an agenda. I'd love to have 5 min alone in a room with these kinds of people </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Everybody who claims the drug is any good should immediately start taking it. Put your mouth where  your mouth is. Yes, it's that simple. Because if you don't... then you are just full of it. :-) </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Turkey is a third world source for medicine lol...it’s really not very effective </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Just cause they are restarting the trial, means nothing... millions of people have tried and it’s not very effective </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Hydrochoroquine is effective on early detection of mild patient. So Turkey and Malaysia has been prescribing this on mild patients all along this past 3months, under doctors prescription and there is no problem. Thousands have recovered and been discharged. For severe and chronic cases however...game is over. Reasons for as many test on the population need to be carried out for early Covid19 detection. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Of course that is the same person that said Friday it was a good day for George Floyd even though he is DEAD </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Our President says it is good stuff.............that is enough for me. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> This is a political hit job. I am a scientist and retired. These doctors should apologize to Trump. They rushed the publication to criticize Trump. At least president Trump tried the drug to see whether or not it works. They are shameful to call themselves scientists (MD). That is one of the reasons most laymen ignore the scientific results. The data should be independently repeated by different labs before publication. The journal should bare some consequences when publishing these "junk" data. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Therefore one common medicine is not suitable to covid 19. HCQ works on some patients at the same time it does not work on some others. It should be researched why it is working and why it’s not working. By modifying the drug components oval HCQ may be prepared to suit all. Or at least use it to whom it suits. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Why there are two videos of "Confusion Over Malaria Drug"? </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Is it true that 3 indians were part of this study???!!! </COMMENT 18>

<COMMENT 1> CDC: "About 1 in 3 adults used chemicals or disinfectants unsafely while trying to protect against COVID-19"  You are responsible for many of those. Thanks for deleting my other comments. You've really revealed yourself. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> I watched both videos and I found them to be extremely helpful! It was also nice that it was presented in a calm positive manner. Well done and highly recommended.😄 Dr. K </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> thank YOU for your wonderful videos! I am sharing on a Jazz List -- oh yeah! the South Florida Jazz List! </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Hi Dr. Please do an updated video regarding masks, etc and things we should do as things reopen. Thanks for your helpful calming videos. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> I'd like to thank you for revising your video presentation based on additional knowledge. I had seen the original one and heard you had revised your information but had trouble getting YouTube to allow you to revise/edit the video so you did a new one. Thank you for your efforts to share your knowledge with us. 🥰 </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> After several trips and cleaning of groceries, I can see how someone can develop dermatitis </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Asking the good doctor or a learned person re: the subject matter that has data to back up their reasoning, in this video you didn't address Covid viability in a cold environment. In point of fact, you stated that microbiologists store other virus samples in the cold. I wipe everything down because there is a possibility I will forget. However, as you point out we aren't perfect so I may forget to wipe stuff down. But I'm not going to mind game myself endlessly because that's what the paid for news is for. I will assume that the pathogen remains non food borne. However, I read about bugs in strawberries yesterday.  Thanks for your initial video. I put it to good use in my home and am referring people to this post. Peace, out </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> I disagree about using a service to deliver groceries. I have seen many grocery Pickers and Packers. They are on their  germy cell phones constantly, your items get touched by them, then the cashier then the transport person. Many transport persons then are in contact with many other people- none of whom have any training pertaining to cross-contamination Airborne pathogens or body fluid pathogens. They don't clean their cars in between deliveries and many of them bring family members or helpers.  Ive sern them place bags on the ground also.  The stores are horrible because they were full of these shoppers who are not careful at all. I've Just Seen way too much to ever use that. people will get mad but I'm telling the truth.  it also makes no sense to shorten the hours at the store because now you're forcing everyone to shop together. This is a really nice video for people who have their own homes with private entrances garages or cars. I like the reference to Sparkles because they get on everything in her very hard to get rid of </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Thanks Doc! </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> You are a very kind man, and I'm happy to see you spreading that kindness around. Thank you so much. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Great work Doc.  Pls share about take way u brought to office n bring back home. Tq. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> I have a 90 yr old MOm.  I shop once every 4 weeks.  Bring all perishables into the basement . Wash containers in a dishpan of soapy water.  Then disinfect w/ alcohol..  I then remove my mask, hat , shoes and change out of  clothes and leave all grocery bags in the  basement.  I wash my face , ears and neck (exposed skin).  I do worry about my long hair which I put up into my baseball hat .... can the virus attach to the underside of my hair?   The Bottled and boxed grocery  items I leave in my truck for UV rays to destroy.  They will stay out there until we need them... or  for the four week duration .   Lettuce and Berries are particularly of concern to me.   For carryout... I have 2 big sheet pans ready.  We dump all the food into the sheet pans at the door and one person immediately takes the carryout containers / pizza box to the outside trash can.    I remove all envelopes from mail OUTSIDE at the garbage can.  I always disinfect my hands after touching the outside garbage / recycle bins.   We leave our newspaper outside on the porch in the plastic sleeve for a few days, flipping it so the Sun's UV rays can destroy any virus.   After bringing my dogs from the vet I gave them a bath. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> First - do most of this in the garage or outside the house, what comes inside the house should be clean.  Second -  get a trash can for the dirty bags and cardboard boxes, no need to touch them twice. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Dr. VanWingen, can you please advise on how long the virus may persist in water mixed with laundry detergent?   I have a small portable washing machine and I cannot use hot water - I use a combo of laundry detergent, dishwashing detergent, and Pine-Sol inin the washing machine.  I have no clue as to how much of these to use per gallon of water.  But most useful would be to know how long the virus survives in water mixed with detergent - hard numbers: X many days when the initial water temperature was Y and concentration of (A,B,C,D) detergents was (a,b,c,d) per gallon.  Your answer would save us so many moments of anxiety! Thank you! </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> I definitely would not leave food opened on your counter while you are unwrapping everything else. This virus is .0001 microns big and it can move with the wind.  I would have tops for your containers ready for when you put your food, chicken, chips etc in these containers. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Can you explain more how you handle ice cream or other frozen items you have to put into the freezer. Do you wipe them first. They dont dry are they going to be ok. I notice that your clothes are touching everything. What do you do about them? Do you think it wise to leave your shoes out. How long does the virus stay on clothes. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Great video I have been doing this for weeks forwarding it to friends and family keep safe everyone </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Thand you Doctor.
You are doing your best for millions of viewers worldwide.
🤗🤗🤗 </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> That tomato @12:45 RIP 😂 </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Thanks......my question is what if i dump groceries for 5 days and than use it without washing outer cover etc.? Note - I have stopped using vegetables ;) </COMMENT 20>

<DESCRIPTION> CNN's Gary Tuchman speaks with beachgoers in Gulf Shores, Alabama, about the Covid-19 pandemic. #CNN #News. </DESCRIPTION>
<TAGS> ['latest News', 'Happening Now', 'CNN', 'coronavirus', 'Covid-19', 'Alabama', 'President Donald Trump', 'Gary Tuchman', 'Gulf Shores'] </TAGS>
<COMMENT 1> As soon as these slack jawed hillbillies open their mouth you know they are willfully ignorant . </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> *Going to the beach is bad. But mass gathering for protesting is good* 🤔🤔🤔🤔 </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Gonna interview these people?

https://youtu.be/SJGT06zIUiY </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> The solution is really quite simple. Treat all offenders like a Citation, no Ticket is given but if they are not Social Distancing or Wearing a Mask if they later contract COViD-19 and seek medical or financial help they will be denied immediately.

All that the Police need to do is start taking names and adding them to a COViD Offences National Database, part of a ‘Pre-Tracing’ solution.

Name, Address, Gov SIN number...easy...

That way all Hospitals, First Responders, Medical Facilities and Financial Facilities have access to those who have committed the Offence.

That’s how you regulate people in to doing ‘what’s right’ </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Well at least hopefully we'll lose a bunch of stupid people </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> It's called herd immunity,as it replicates through it looses it virility just like Rinovirus </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> It was getting better so the left killed George Floyd to start a race war ! </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> The south must be stupid central </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Really, people partying, beachin'? 😒 What's so sad is that most of my countrymen don't wear masks, not because they don't want it, but they can't afford to have one.😔 </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> If Trump ever demands China for compensation for this virus they can just show this video as evidence they were not responsible. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> "You can't fix stupid."  - Ron White
7000 people in the US died from COVID-19 since this was reported.  That's one week ago. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Alabama - where de 27%  black folks at? Not at the beach anyway. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> For those who say that CNN is only targeting people and not the protesters about the coronavirus, they did https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2020/06/01/health/protests-coronavirus-spread-concerns/index.html . </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Darwin's plan for Alabama. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> One week later, CNN did not criticize protesters/rioters who were not practicing social distancing guidelines. Double standard, much? </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> I caught and survived covid19. It's very different from the flu. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Funny their complaining about this and not the fact the protesters don't social distance </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> This is what happens when stupid people breed </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Covid is being spread by Obama and Hillary in a gay-laboratory that's also staging another fake moon landing. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> this is what happens when siblings have kids with siblings, they devolve. alabama is just that, and we've always known. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 1> Ok I hope so because it seems like fssa is making it harder to maintain </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> I had my phone interview and the caseworker insisted I have income coming from something. She asked how I live without income to get necessities. She was so angry with me she never said goodbye, just hung up on me. Why are people treating people who need snap like a lower class individuals. Benefits are for people with low income or no income. 
I'm sure being a caseworker is stressful but don't take it out on the people who need help, that's what causes some people to go hungry instead of being judged. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> FSSA needs to allow e-mail communication in the future, but especially now. The FSSA offices are closed, as are the libraries. I was told that I can mail documents in, but so many are also without a printer while the library is closed. Faxes are nearly a thing of the past and FSSA would be wise to update to a faster, easier, and more organized way of submitting documents. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Super grateful for the food stamps. Truly, I am. The only note I can offer FSSA is that, during a redetermination, if you don't get the documents you need, you don't find out until it's too late to do anything and you have to wait to reapply all over again. There is finally a web page that does offer some communication but it's far from clear. Being able to email documents would be very much appreciated as well. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> I applied last week... </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> The FSSA link you mentioned has been out of service for the PAST WEEK! </COMMENT 6>

Je remarque également que la France n aimes pas son peuple !
Les preuves ne manquent pas !
Les autres pays l ont clairement démontré !
Malgré son gouvernement égoïste, son peuple est beau, son peuple est fort.
Avec peux, les gens ont fait des miracles.
Merci au peuple, qui a bataillé pour notre peuple français.

<COMMENT 7> Je suis à 1000% athée, pour moi la science est au-dessus de tout, la méthode scientifique et l'étude des biais ça me parle, j'ai depuis des années suivi tous les zététos (c'est comme ça que je les nomme dorénavant) car j'y ai appris beaucoup il faut le reconnaître, enfin j'ai surtout pu comprendre comment aiguiser d'avantage son esprit critique, dans le même temps je rejetais Aberkane (à juste titre pour certaines choses ça il faut le reconnaître aussi, car le neuromachinchouette et les manipulations de cv trop peu pour moi), puis est arrivé cette crise et surtout "l'affaire" Raoult et là j'ai comme reçu un coup de couteau rouillé dans le dos par toute la communauté zététique tellement ils étaient emplis d'une nullité intellectuelle que j'ignorais, ou plutôt que je ne voulais pas m'avouer... 


Ils ont assassiné le mot jugeote et ça m'a profondément déçu, récemment je les ai tous supprimé avec grand regret certes que ce soit sur fb ou youtube mais le mal était fait et c'est irréversible tant pis pour eux.


Et bizarrement alors qu'on était en pleine tempête et que j'étais en train de me battre sur les réseaux avec les méthodistes psycho-rigide qui sont bien trop fort pour moi dans la rhétorique, et bien je suis tombé un peu par hasard (pas vraiment vu le buzz) sur la fameuse vidéo où Idriss disait en introduction _"La corruption académique tue!"_ et depuis je me surprend à n'être que d'accord avec tout ce qu'il dit, c'est assez incroyable comment les événements peuvent changer radicalement les opinions des uns et des autres, et sans me la raconter je suis bien content de faire parti de ces gens-là, ceux ayant encore de la jugeote et un véritable esprit critique ! </COMMENT 7>

Dr. Andrew Kaufman: They Want To Genetically Modify Us With The COVID-19 Vaccine
https://youtu.be/qy5FD0XameI
In this powerful interview Spiro is joined with Doctor Andrew Kaufman. Spiro and Dr. Kaufman discuss the expanding curtailment of basic civil liberties being normalized under the false pretext of a global health emergency.

Doctor Kaufman lays his reputation and his career on the line as he blows the whistle, on what he describes as a manufactured crisis to carry out a preplanned agenda to facilitate global governance and population control.

Doctor Kaufman is a well educated medical professional who convincingly illustrates, using the CDC's own technical data, how the public has been manipulated on the grandest scale. </COMMENT 11>

<COMMENT 17> Bonjour,

Les zététiciens restent simplement rigoureux sur la volonté de ne pas prétendre aléatoirement des choses et de les présenter comme étant vraies lorsque celles-ci n'ont pas été prouvées et lorsqu'il n'y a aucune source vérifiable. Les zeteticiens plus que tous savent que la science avance par l'erreur et la mise en place d'actions correctrices. Chasser la malhonnêteté scientifique renforcera l'efficacité de la méthode. Il y a suffisamment de boue et d'erreurs non volontaires forcément causées par le principe même de la recherche (votre emploi du mot boue est d'ailleurs ridicule, car même si une conclusion est erronée ce n'est pas de la boue, c'est une connaissance. Savoir que telle piste est fausse est une connaissance) pour ne pas que s'y ajoute de malhonnêtes prétentions de pseudo-savoir. Il y a une différence entre résultats négatifs, erreurs et mensonges... Ce sont les mensonges que les zeteticiens chassent. Le fait de vous les être mis à dos de part vos propres actions et comportements mensongers passés ne justifie en rien vos propos ici.

A votre place, il me semble que j'essaierai de tourner la page et d'apprendre de mes erreurs plutôt que de revenir sur un sujet dont vous ne sortez pas grandi et imputable à vos strictes décisions personnelles. J'ai regardé votre vidéo sur l'art contemporain... il y avait beaucoup trop à dire en terme d'erreurs et de propagation d'idées fausses.., je me suis abstenu. Je suis persuadé que vos qualités peuvent être utiles si vous les cadriez et si vous ne débordiez pas hors des sujets que vous maîtrisez pas. Il faudrait également peut être avoir l'humilité d'accepter de ne pas tout savoir, et d'accepter la critique. C'est aussi ainsi qu'avance la science. Je suis persuadé qu'en revoyant votre méthode et votre fonctionnement, vous seriez d'une inestimable valeur pour participer à des réflexions sur certains sujets. Vos revanches personnelles à la rhétorique bancale sont ridicules, c'est vraiment dommage.

Pour reprendre votre analogie, vous ne pouvez pas dire à la fois que la boue on s'en moque puisqu'on va la passer au tamis et dans le même temps accuser la zetetique, de casser la science puisque l'esprit de La zététique n'est ni plus ni moins que celui de votre tamis Monsieur. Et si vous ne passez pas à travers le tamis, ne vous en prenez pas à lui, essayez plutôt de vous dégrossir. Ce message porte sur les propos et les idées que vous avancez ici, non sur votre personne (enfin dans l'intention) </COMMENT 17>

<COMMENT 1> This was excellent. Down to earth, plain language, science based. I worked in US Public Health for over 25 years. Have not heard anyone explain it better. Thank you for posting this interview👍👍 </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> I understand that you have to edit for time, but where can I find the entire interview?  Thanks. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Asian boss always kept us informed not only about the global pandemic but about what is happening around Asian countries.. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> When you watch Hatarakou Saibo, this is easy pissy topic to understand. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> This is the best explanation ever </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> I am not asian </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> This is one of the best interviews I've heard. Crystal clear. Thank you for doing this. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> I cannot thank you enough for your commitment in informing the public and for the quality of the guests you're choosing all along this crisis. Be again thanked for your efforts and skill 🌼 ! </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> 34:20 </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> The part about HIV is astounding, wow. Excellent vid. Thank you. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> So we got the virus from invading and destroying jungles and stealing wild animals and selling them in wet markets (hell holes). Now, we're going to torture more animals to find a vaccine. It's just messed up that's all. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> "Why don't we have a vaccine for HIV?" MONEY. Drug companies make more money selling all the bandaid drugs. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> I love these kind of interviews from Asian Boss with real professionals that don't focus on entertaining but on giving accurate information and ending misinformation </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Thank you, Dr. Kim </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> There should be done way these two extremely intelligent physicians can be on main stream tv ! </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> 99% of the people who got covid recovered without the need for any vaccine. 
Do you know what is in those vaccines? Please check. Baby fetuses, aluminum and formalehyde.
Do you think this will help you with your health? </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Please check how the World Health Organisation has made a vaccination campaign in Kenya with an anti-fertility agent in vaccines to sterilise women in 2014.
Please the article on researchgate made by scientist so you can judge by yourself as some articles from some media have tried to say it was a mistake or not true.
They have tried to do the same thing in Mexico, Philippines and Nicaragua in 1994.
I m sure this doctor must know these cases. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Can't believe how he explained so well what is a vaccine and how it works. I understand perfectly. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> The way he tells the information and pronounces it , it's very very clear. Wow </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Dr Kim is very clear, thorough, and calm in answering these great interview questions from Stephen Park, which are always presented as a genuine dialogue rather than a firing off of “Question 1—done, Question 2—done” as often happens in media interviews. These are great interviews. I appreciate your preparedness for these dialogues, Stephen, and your choice of the experts you interview. Great job. Thank you! </COMMENT 20>

Les racailles de banlieues s'en donneront à cœur joie et le jour d'après ? Aucun projet, aucune unité, des recettes fiscales en chute libre, la spirale du chaos.

<COMMENT 9> A propos de la mortalité, un petit calcul : 7 milliards d'habitants / hypothèse longévité moyenne 70 ans ( pour ne pas se casser la tête ) = 100 millions de décès par an. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> L'article 35 de la Déclaration des droits de l'homme et du citoyen du 24 juin 1793 affirme:
« Quand le gouvernement viole les droits du peuple, l'insurrection est pour le peuple et pour chaque portion du peuple, le plus sacré des droits et le plus indispensable des devoirs ».
Relevant de l'ordre constitutionnel, l'insurrection est ainsi un droit imprescriptible « supérieur aux lois » ; elle permet au peuple de manifester directement sa force et sa puissance plus que son désir de s'opposer aux dérives de l'Etat vers l'arbitraire ou l'injustice manifeste ; elle lui permet d'exprimer pacifiquement (ou violemment, selon l'intensité de la répression qui pourrait lui être opposée par les organes de pouvoir) son refus, son rejet, son objection à toute orientation vers le despotisme et l'autoritarisme. Le droit à l'insurrection signifie clairement que les fondements de la légitimité des pouvoirs publics se sont totalement désorganisés. Il est le « dernier recours » avant la révolution, laquelle peut devenir nécessité si la confusion devient dérèglement et s'inscrit dans l'ordre constitutionnel.
Le droit à l'insurrection a pour titulaire le « peuple », non l'individu ou un groupe d'individus. Il est une « sanction » à l'égard des gouvernements qui ont failli à leurs missions, à leurs taches. </COMMENT 10>

Victoire en vue sur le Covid.
Merci à Corinne Prose pour le partage:

Info transmise par le Whatsapp des professeurs de médecine, médecins et directeurs de clinique du groupe Elsan.
Covid-19 : Une découverte majeure :
Plusieurs équipes dans plusieurs pays (notamment en Chine, en France - à Lille - aux USA), ont fait une découverte majeure qui offre un grand espoir de traitement du covid :
Le virus, en effet, ne tuerait pas directement, mais par l'intermédiaire d'une bactérie intestinale qu'il infecterait, la Prevotella... et c'est cette bactérie infectée qui, devenant virulente, déclencherait l'hyper-réaction immunitaire qui délabre les poumons et tue le malade !
Ceci expliquerait :

Pourquoi le traitement du Dr. Raoult, utilisant un antibiotique (l'Azithromycine), et plus encore celui du Dr Sabine Paliard-Franco, qui préconise une double antibiothérapie, fonctionnent,

Pourquoi les enfants sont épargnés et les personnes âgées plus touchées : Provetella est quasiment absente de la flore intestinale enfantine, mais de plus en plus présente avec l'âge,

Pourquoi les obèses sont beaucoup plus touchés : leur flore intestinale déséquilibrée contient beaucoup de Prevotella !

Pourquoi les complications pulmonaires se déclenchent alors qu'on ne retrouve pratiquement plus de covid dans l'appareil respiratoire, la bactérie infectée (qu'on retrouve dans les selles, contenant de l'ARN du covid et parfois même des virus vivants) prenant le relai de son attaque initiale (bénigne), de manière beaucoup plus dramatique, en déclenchant l'hyper-réaction immunitaire inflammatoire qui noie les poumons...

Pourquoi le virus peut réapparaître chez un patient guéri (avec alternance de positivité et de négativité des tests), car la bactérie, toujours présente dans la flore intestinale, en reste l'hôte et peut le relarguer à tous moments...

Bref, cela expliquerait tout ; et cette cohérence augure de la validité de l'hypothèse.
On tient donc une confirmation de l'intérêt de l'azithromycine, comme thérapeutique curative, à prescrire dès le début de l'infection... et même une piste prometteuse pour traiter préventivement les infections graves (des coronavirus... et sans doute aussi de la grippe !), ce traitement passant par le rétablissement d'une flore intestinale saine qui neutralise Prevotella (par la prescriptions de "probiotiques", c'est à dire d'une bonne flore intestinale)...

Il est clair que cette piste thérapeutique ultra-prometteuse bon-marché rendrait alors caduque l'utilisation d'un vaccin, de découverte aléatoire et onéreuse... ce qui ruinerait donc encore les espoirs lucratifs de Gilead et de ses lobbyistes, après l'échec patent de leurs antiviraux... dont on ne parle plus trop, vu que les premiers essais thérapeutiques (dont plusieurs malades ont payé le prix de leur vie) se sont révélés catastrophiques, tant en terme d'inefficacité que de toxicité...
Il est probable aussi que les médias aux ordres, qui avaient lynché Raoult, parce qu'il laissait entrevoir cette piste thérapeutique bon marché, qui concurrençait leurs antiviraux dont ils attendaient de gros retours financiers, nous taisent cette découverte majeure, et qu'en revanche ils nous serinent maintenant, à temps et à contretemps, que leur vaccin (qui est loin d'être au point et qu'il faudra refaire chaque année, comme celui de la grippe) est la "seule solution" !

<COMMENT 15> Excellente analyse de Michel Maffesoli. C'est vraiment agréable d'entendre des paroles censées sur la situation actuelle et nous expliquer comment les mots faux ont et drainent encore des maux terribles!!  Sa vision d'une nouvelle génération à venir basée sur l'essentiel donne une véritable bouffée d'oxygène,  d'espoir et c'est indispensable pour construire une nouvelle base pour notre avenir. Merci encore pour cette très belle intervention et je souligne votre sens de partage de votre culture avec beaucoup humilité. Je vais me plonger dans vos livres avec impatience !! Tout mon respect. Cordialement. </COMMENT 15>

<COMMENT 3> he world is treating this covid 19 virus as the deadliest disease ever in the world. The world's media has made sure that this collective psychological fear prevails. All and every information on the news has kept people in a state of panic. Here are some facts to inform you of this false pandemia.Yes, covid 19 is deadly for all who have chronic health problems. According to the United Nations World Population Prospects report, approximately 7,452 people die every day in the United States. In other words, a person dies in the US approximately every 12 seconds. You can see a live clock keeping track of how many people have died today athttps://www.indexmundi.com/clocks/indicator/deaths/united-states. You can compare the number of deaths in the US to the number of deaths in other countries athttps://www.indexmundi.com/clocks/indicator/deaths. During the 2018-2019 season, the CDC estimates 16.5 million people went to a health care provider for the flu and more than 34,000 people died in the U.S. The prior season saw 61,000 deaths.30 ene. 2020 </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> I hear so much about asymptomatic but I have yet to see a single person who has had their vital signs monitored (meaning carefully measured), at least daily, from BEFORE infection through to the diagnosis.  I've been looking for almost three months and not a single data point.  If anyone knows of a case, please comment to me.  Thanks. </COMMENT 4>

<COMMENT 6> It seems like someone needs to make you aware that many older people aren't being bad if they aren't staying home.  Social security only pays a loto f us $750 a  month, what are you thinking.  We go to work! </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> At the initial stage of corona virous sign while taking nutritious food eat two Murunga seeds after food every time and drink a cup of water for about 20 days.It may help you . RABINDRA </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Dr. Thomas Yadegar, ICU Director at Providence Cedars-Sinai Tarzana Medical Center has developed a 100% cure for COVID-19. NBC TV news interviewed him on April 1, 2020, so it has been in the public domain since then. He developed a medical tool, a diagnostic panel of clinical "markers" to enable him to predetermine which COVID-19 patients would normally require respirator treatments and he aggressively intervened with immunosuppressants to prevent Cytokine Storm Syndrome. And, he administered an anti-inflammatory to quell widespread inflammation. While we are waiting for a vaccine, Dr. Yadegar's approach, if adopted, has the potential to dramatically lower the death rate worldwide from COVID-19. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> And in general those who have the money to afford the best care really don't want to pay for that care for those who can't afford it. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> I have been sent home from nursing home/post hospital rehab after 10 days (Medicare/Medicaid) with pneumonia, and has taken me 18 mos (with constant dr appts, and overnight hospitalizatons) because of underlying copd and chf, to get well. Now the same thing has happened to a 92 yr old relative who suffered a broken hip. Discharged with numerous issues, and most likely will have to go back to a va place, with many covid cases. </COMMENT 10>

<COMMENT 14> Thank you. I'm another health care professional, retired, but also in my 60's and single. Being single and isolated, but being fortunate enough to own my house, I am grateful. However, not really being able to afford any help and with my children so busy in their own lives that they are not able to help,, is a problem I've not even seen addressed. Therefore, in trying to maintain my independence while doing all of my own house/yard maintenance and repairs  by myself, which I've done for years, is becoming more difficult. I am basically still healthy, but do have a narcolepsy condition that interferes with my ability to get everything done! Even if I could afford to hire plumbers, etc, they aren't now allowed to come inside my home.. which honestly, I am totally for, in terms of maintaining social distance. Same w/ my kids. I had a financial opportunity to add income that I felt quite confident of, vanish for the time being, due to the pandemic, as well. All of my friends are basically married, so I have to admit being more lonely. Plus one more thing I didn't hear mentioned is the risk of falls with no one ever even knowing. This has even happened to me a couple of times and fortunately, my relatively sturdy self survived without a major injury. But if any of you have ever worked in home health care, these are the same kind of issues, but without any outside help. Plus, the added financial crisis is another major factor on us older people, especially when single and without a second income, that needs to be acknowledged and addressed. Thanks for the open forum! </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> When using the prevalence to calculate PPV and NPV, we need to take into account the fact that the patient in question may have symptoms, so the prevalence of the disease among a patient with those symptoms is definitely higher than the prevalence in the population. People seem confused about that. The PPV and NPV depends on how typical the patient presentation is. It will be different in a typical patient, and atypical patient, and a contact of a positive patient, than it is in a member of the population without symptoms. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Thank you all for your work in elder care. You're highly appreciated. </COMMENT 16>

<COMMENT 5> Thank you for this webinar. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Thank you for the insights. Biodivesity varies from country to country. How could we possibly sustain it and maintain equilibrium? As I observe, many do not follow world ethics on environment protection and continue to alter its state </COMMENT 6>

Theme: COVID-19 Effects Biodiversity: Science Education Reimagined

The topic in the webinar is very informative and useful most especially in our trends today all over the world. As educator it helps me a lot because I can be an instrument to dissiminate the information to my students and for them to become aware on the effect of climate change in our ecosystem. I need to educate the students about the importance of Biodiversity and how they can save it. Being a part of the community every individual needs to be on how they can contribute to save the earth and our nature. As we all know we get foods from nature and if the nature are affected we might not be able to get some food even on land and water, all the living and non-livings things are affected because of this pandemic and we will never know when it will end. We can still do something to save the biodiversity. The Education department also includes the topics about the biodiversity to educate the students and for them to be aware of how it will affect human, animals and nature. We need to save the earth for the next generation and we should educate them now before it’s too late. </COMMENT 9>

<COMMENT 11> Hello TerraFriends! Allow me a few observations. We need systemic (limited) Terra-Protectivity, before productivity, before profit. No safe Nature, no safe profit. One Terra, one (limited) Time, one Peace. Sciences and arts, including informatics, have to defend our Planet-Family-Ship, as guardians, blocking all terra-abusive activities. Humans-Gods, defend Peace against wars, Truth against lies, for all Terra-Family! (gods=superior beings of Cosmos, small and big) We have to support Reason, not illusion. True science, like mathematics, astronomy, ethics etc., not pseudoscience, as numerology, astrology, religion etc. Humans ARE terrian gods. We can think by self and together, pray in need one to other, bless the triad Cosmos-alter/ego. Terra.Protectivity before productivity. See Carl Sagan, critique on astrology fraud. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbJJ7bg-en0 And Dr. Peter Goetzsche, critique on toxic nutri-medications, www.deadlymedicines.dk. Also, Terrian Humanity needs decent Pancracy and Pangratuity, not toxi-predatory vote and money. We will build terrahonesty and terrahonouring with terra.good. Stop to official-gansta lies!
Best t-regards. t as terra, time, truth, thought, try, tea etc.

<COMMENT 1> Estoy viendo esto por que tengo que hacer unas preguntas de tarea jajajaj </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Esto lo vi por la tarea
Nada mas </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Muy bien DR López Gatell animo saludos </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> que pedo y que vamos a comer con que vamos a pagar la renta sin ayudas ni trabajo ni nada  la cuarentena cada vez sé alarga mas y más Ya Nmms </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Dr Gatell usted siempre un caballero, gracias x estar en estos momentos tan difíciles al mando de nuestro gran país como el profesional que es. Segura estoy bcomo muchos q pasara a la historia como uno mas de los grandes.
Y eso no cualquiera. Nadie logrará opacar su trabajo. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Los estados quisieron implementar sus métodos, aquí en Guadalajara ya tenemos más de 70 días guardados y nos piden 15 más, esto ya es un juego político, falta los estragos económicos y psicológicos, que con el tiempo, ya no le darán importancia, porque ya no les será útil a sus fines políticos. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> UN GOBIERNO EQUIVOCADO EN TODOS SUS PRONÓSTICOS  SE GUÍAN POR UNA BOLA DE VIDRIO Y UNA ESTAMPILLA DE LA VIRGEN </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> YA PARA QUÉ? SI EL PEJE YA ESTÁ HACIENDO LO QUE SE LE PEGA LA GANA!!!! </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Muchas graficas se puede o no puede sean concretos mal desempeño del Gobierno viene lo peor desgraciadamente han sido cómplices de teorías mediocres que   serán contundentes para agravar la situación bla bla bla </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Otra vez nuestra negligencia como población no va a meter en una grave situación ya muchos sin cubrebocas en las calles hoy y sin la sana distancia , entiendo que todos necesitamos el pan en la mesa,pero si este gobierno federal no es corrupto y ladrón porque no apoyan con efectivo a la gente que no tiene un empleo estable o lo perdió o vive del comercio informal </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Que manera tan inteligente de contestarle a la senadora </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Las ciencias de la salud como la medicina, no son exactas como las matemáticas. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Las cifras de contagio y defunciones NO son reales porque se basan en pruebas mínimas que aplica el gobierno. Por lo que es muy arriesgado para la población regresar sin test y pruebas rápidas,  además, es fácil perder el control en "La nueva normalidad". </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Otro loco denle línea y ya </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> hello there friend! wIEo </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> FELICIDADES AL DOCTOR LÓPEZ GATELL APARTE DE GUAPO ES TODO UN CABALLERO. SE NOTA SU EXCELENTE EDUCACIÓN. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Que se haga obligatorio el uso de cubrebocas en el transporte público. La gente no atiende indicaciones, les vale todo y, después ya están lamentándose. Aunado a que arriesgan a los otros. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Creo en usted Dr. Gatell y el Sr. presidente así que me niego a creer lo que menciona la UNAM en un artículo, el cual dice que lo peor de la pandemia está por venir, esperándose para el 27 de junio. </COMMENT 18>

<COMMENT 8> Chỉ có một cách phòng chống dịch bệnh vô cùng hiệu quả    đó là  tạm dừng đóng cửa khẩu và các hàng hóa ở các nước ngoài về việt nam ...và tạm dừng xuất nhập cảnh về việt nam và việt nam đi các nước  kể cả các nước chưa có dịch  tạm dừng tất cả các chuyên bay từ các nước đến và đi các nước  tạm dừng các khu du lịch ở trong nước... Cấm các lễ hội trên toàn quốc ở thời điểm đang có dịch bùng phát    và các nơi tụ tập đông người    nên tập trung cao độ để phòng chống dịch bệnh.   Có như vậy chắc chắn 100%  Việt nam sẽ  không để dịch bệnh tràn về việt nam </COMMENT 8>

<COMMENT 16> Nước rửa tay thì chỗ mình không thiếu, chỉ có khẩu trang là rất khan hiếm. Mình làm công nhân ở cty, cty của mình không trang bị khẩu trang cho công nhân, là do bản thân mỗi người tự ý thức thôi. Có nhiều chị em không thể mua được khẩu trang y tế thì đeo khẩu trang vải hoặc những loại có tinh thể muối với giá 15k/cái (tái sử dụng được 3 đến 5 lần). Có rất nhiều chị em không chịu nổi và bị dị ứng với khẩu trang vải thì sẽ chọn mua trên mạng với giá chỉ khoảng 60 đến 65k 1 hộp 50 cái. Thực sự các y bác sĩ và những người ở vùng tâm dịch sẽ cần những chiếc khẩu trang kia hơn nhưng với người dân thì.... Thử hỏi làm sao khẩu trang không sốt giá được??? </COMMENT 16>

CÔ-RÔ-NA-VŨ-HÁN

Cô-Rô-Vũ-Hán xổng chuồng
Gây nên dịch bệnh luông tuồng hiểm nguy
Trung-Nam-Hải ém nhẹm đi
Người dân Tàu Cộng chết vì… lây lan
Quạ đen muỗi độc kêu khan
Bầu trời u ám… Hán gian tung hoành
Cô-Vít 19 xuân xanh
Vượt ranh Vũ Hán lộng hành khắp nơi
Gây nên đại dịch cho người
Cách ly, phong tỏa… đáng đời Hán gian
Trung Hoa lục địa bế quan
Chia năm sẻ bảy… suy tàn đến nơi

HẾT BẢY CÒN BA

Ngồi buồn xem chuyện Cô Vi
Mới hơn trăm bữa Cô đi toàn cầu 
Nghe tên trên nét cũng rầu
Bởi đang nổi tiếng năm Châu vang rền
Từ “Hãn Vú” Cô bò lên
Trẻ già bé nhớn Cô “khền” chẳng tha 
Từ người Cô hoá thành ma
Đưa vô lò sấy í a vi trần 
Tàng hình cố giấu đôi chân
Cô bay lơ lửng ghé gần sân bay
Chỉ cần tay chạm… tóc mai
Hương gây mùi nhớ, men cay hít vào
Cô Vi hớn hở đến chào
Bao nhiêu nan phổi ôi chao chứa đầy
Cô cười má đỏ hây hây 
Tha hồ bày tiệc phen nầy no nê
Cách ly, ngăn chặn trò hề 
Thênh thang cất bước theo mê lộ dài
Mask che, đeo kiếng... mặc ai 
Cô Vi đỏng đảnh trổ tài đó nha 
Mười phần hết bảy còn ba

HẬN TÀU CỘNG  

Tim lòng quặn thắt từng cơn
Lòng dâng lên nỗi căm hờn Tàu Hoa
Bao người rưng lệ xót xa
Vì đâu thế giới chan hòa sầu thương
Năm châu,bốn bể đoạn trường
Bầm gan tím ruột giận phường lưu manh
Để cho Cô-Vít hoành hành
Tràn lan khắp chốn và tanh xác người
Cận Bình họ Tập kia ơi,
Sao mà ác quá ông trời chẳng dung
Biển Đông sóng dậy đùng đùng
Đông Nam Châu Á cùng chung số phần
Thiên Công chỉ điểm mấy lần
Bao nhiêu bịnh lạ dần dần xảy ra
Ngày sau tụi nó thành ma
Luật trời vay trả âu là chí công!

<COMMENT 2> Khi bệnh đã lan ra cộng đồng thì phải nghĩ tới sống chung với dịch cũng giống như sống chung với lũ của TT Võ văn Kiệt. Điều mà chúng ta kỳ vọng là sau khi đại dịch phát tán 1 thời gian thì mức độ nặng (ác tính) của bệnh ngày càng giảm theo thời gian. Điều này mang tính quy luật. Tuy nhiên, đợt dịch sau có thể nặng hơn đợt dịch đầu tiên do biến chủng xảy ra (rất hiế gặp). </COMMENT 2>

<COMMENT 13> "for our species there's no greater advantage than the sharing of knowledge"
I wonder how that goes with the ideia of intelectual property in a neo-liberal economy.

Basically, neo-liberalism goes against cultural evolution </COMMENT 13>

<COMMENT 4> Lần trước, tàu Liêu Ninh và 5 tàu hộ tống hôm 12.4 đã đi ngang eo biển Miyako ở phía nam Nhật Bản và phía đông Đài Loan, trước khi hướng về Biển Đông để tổ chức cuộc tập trận mà theo giới quan sát là nhằm gửi thông điệp cho Mỹ.
Trong buổi họp báo tại Bộ Ngoại giao Mỹ ngày 22.4, Ngoại trưởng Mike Pompeo tiếp tục cáo buộc Trung Quốc đang lợi dụng lúc thế giới tập trung ứng phó đại dịch Covid-19 để thực hiện "hành vi khiêu khích" nhằm gây áp lực đối với Hồng Kông, Đài Loan và bắt nạt các nước láng giềng ở Biển Đông, theo Reuters </COMMENT 4>

<COMMENT 9> 1 Phút sẽ cứu được ai đó hết nợ nần

Đôi lời chia sẻ tới mọi người mình là một người chơi lô đề và khi mình chơi thua lỗ bể nợ lên tới hơn 150 triệu , cuộc sống lúc đó đúng là đến tệ tới mức người gia đình còn xa lánh , mất hết niềm tin của anh em bạn bè. Cuộc sống thật dự bế tắc
Trước mình cũng mua số rất nhiều nơi phí trước.phí sau .miễn phí có cả .nhưng tiền mất tật mang mà chính như thế mình mới mang nợ nhiều. Hoang mang
, may sao lướt facebook  có quen đươc1 bạn và giới thiệu qua Bên Zalo Anh Nhật ____ 0854081234
 Hôm đầu tiên theo mình cũng sợ nên mình chỉ dám lấy lô mình ăn được 3 hôm lô liên tiếp thì mình có vốn và đủ sự tin tưởng thì mình lấy Đề ai ngờ trúng  cả   Đề .thì thực sự mình biết đây chính là ân nhân của mình rồi￼, qua đây anh chị em ai lâm vào hoàn cảnh như mình thì liên hệ với bác ấy xem mà cố gắng. Mình nói bằng chính facebook thật của mình hơn 2.000 bàn bè và tâm sự bằng chính những gì mình trải qua. Mong cho những ai nợ nần thì sớm hết nợ￼.hiểu rõ hơn ai hết￼ cảnh mang nợ
Chúc cho cả nhà một ngày mới tốt lành </COMMENT 9>
