<COMMENT 2> 5 Widely Spreading Myths about Covid-19!
https://youtu.be/S4kVMr5yhi0 </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> We are all in a state of uncertainty about spreading Covid 19. Take an example of India now the spreading is skyrocketing, though the risks of importing cases are the paramount the number of Covid 19 tests, asymptomatic ratios are significantly higher in India when comparing with United States or GCC countries.  With 2.3 Billion population with poverty and limited medical resources to analyse the infected data it is highly possible India will soon overtake the world No.1 in Covid-19 cases.

<COMMENT 11> Why is a virus that came out in 2020 named Covid 19 after the year 2019? Ummm, they didn't think that one through? Looks suspicious. It's not helping debunk the rumors that it was created in a lab in 2019... </COMMENT 11>

<COMMENT 13> Well done! Love the way the whiteboard was semi filled with diagrams and then added onto it while explaining. He has got a nice handwriting too! This guy should get a STEM award for awesome science teachings skills for young and adult minds!. One question. Isn't RT PCR is reverse transcriptase PCR rather than real time PCR? Minor stuff though! </COMMENT 13>

I do wish everyone the best & hope this crisis ends ASAP.  Stay safe &  help out your neighbor.  WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER. </COMMENT 15>

<COMMENT 18> Everywhere you look on the internet you see WORK being offered ads posted by FEMA.

So, the US Government knows this situation is going to get much worse (FEMA job offerings) because they are the one's in charge of the situation.

These FEMA death camps were build 15 years ago so, what does that tell you.

The COVID19 throat swabs tainted with the virus ?

Will the vaccination shots give people the virus like the "flu shot" gives the elderly the flu ?

Government officials in other states are telling their citizens that there are dangers insects in the area and aircraft will be conducting an Ariel Spraying CAMPAIGN over their neighborhoods at sunset when people are at home.

People in the food processing industry are mysteriously becoming sick with COVID19 therefore, food shortages can arise.

The US Government is buying up all face masks and gloves then hiding them is warehouses in order to keep them out of the hands of needy citizens.

Secrecy behind the global 5G surveillance program and the widespectuum RF Radiation that is dangerous to people's health.

People and their families living on special Military bases since last year are restricted from television, raido, internet and all outside comuniciations with the outside world and these military personal are flying these high ALTITUDE aircraft that are spraying a mystery fluid into the air whereas these elongated offwhite clouds are seen everywhere.  

People in the News Media are observed smiling and with grinds on their faces when discussing the deadly global Pandemic.

No one person in the upper most portion of the US Government has ever been seen wearing a mask. Have they received a vaccination shot prior to the Pandemic ? </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> If all of these corona virus’ are coming from bats, then why is it that the ladies that rehabilitate bats in Australia for years, ( being scratched and bitten by them many times) are not getting these sicknesses and dropping dead in masses? </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 11> Hello, sir.

Let me introduce myself, I'm Ferry, from Bogor, Indonesia.

Just sharing info. That in Indonesia, our small team, named Milagros, has given milagros water donations to hospitals that treat positive patients.

And the result, just by drinking Milagros water, recovery from covid19, is very perfect.

In our data, it has been noted that Milagros water is able to fight covid19. Also other health problems.

What I'm focusing on is that in Indonesia there is no need for a vaccine. We just take Milagros, corona can be overcome.

Right now, what your country does not have, but in my country is very abundant, is Milagros water.

Which is clearly proven to be able to cure positive patients covid19 to completion.

And it's proven, some of our small teams don't need an anti-covid vaccine. Just drinking milagros, it's resolved.

If you want to know more about Milagros water, you can contact my Whatsapp number at +6285925081694 </COMMENT 11>

<COMMENT 2> Just go vegan ;) Best thing you can do for your health. If you do go vegan, make sure to take a B12 supplement though, and 15 minutes to max. 30 minutes in the Sun every day without sunscreen (for vitamin D). Thank me in 50 years. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> I discovered that Vitamin D cures Flu before 10 years. We tested this in Bulgaria against Coronavirus in Bulgaria and that worked fine. I made many videos - Youtube DELETED THEM - because maybe they support Bill Gates and Soros... </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Alcohol vapor can cure respiratory infection. Vitamin C is always helpful. hydroxychloroquine is a dangerous substance. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> They don't want us healthy - SICKNESS IS PROFIT. Too late, the Coronavirus as let the cat out of the bag now and we all know now that lack of vitamin D - as well as other vitamins, is the reason for most preventable diseases. What will be their next step - get the companies who make the vitamins fill them with sugar? </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Hi Mike, It would be good to mention the relationship between D3 and K2(MK7) the two go hand in hand. D3 on its own actually can do damage to the heart. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> If humidity is a factor and heat then why are there cases in Florida and Texas at this time of the year in June.  Hotter areas of the country are still experiencing Covid19, and it is now June 6, 2020. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> thank you doctor but with autoimmune diseases we need more(zinc,vitamines D3,k2,A,C...) </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Well I caught the virus and I gake vitaminc c and I was better within 4 days. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Dr. Mike, always informative with no fluff. Thanks for helping to educate people and help them navigate to junk science and noise on the web today. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Requirements of Vitamin c or D or both or multivitamins vary person to person. But actually weather doesn't do anything  with pandemic bcoz some countries are v hot some are v cold and still situation is same regarding COVID-19.. its actually virus who had mutation in a v short duration and causing deaths at the same pace..
Please make video about this. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> I hear so many recommendations about taking vitaminD supplements over the counter, however nobody explains what is in these softgels,  what’s the liquid inside these softgels, what do they put inside these softgels. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> You need to take zink and vitamin d , you may have a problem getting zink , God bless 🎈 </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> There are no numbers telling 4000 IU a day is a maximum. There are only, that 4000 IU is good enough for MOST people to get their blood numbers normal. It is not for those with stronger deficiencies etc. Very bad combination of information. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> I'm impressed by the suggestive recommendations being made to help me understand better ways to improve my Health and loved ones thank you so much for taking the time and making these presentations goes to show that improving our health during this time will always go a long way God Bless America </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> It depends on the individual health </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> How much is that Vitamin C & D. Dr.Mike </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Thank you...Folks, re-read the video's title ...The answer is, YES, take your vitamins ( C and D) and minerals(Zinc and magnesium) and eat your antioxidants ASAP... Do not wait for Vaccines....Mandatory, forced vaccines...Line up...Wait, Don’t be me. I am an M.D. but let me tell you what you do not know about vaccines and what I didn’t know and what 90% of all M.D.'s do not know and what No politician knows... I did not know that Vaccines had not been tested against any placebo (ever). I did not know that animal testing would be skipped for the future COVID vaccines..I did not know the 30+ ingredients used in vaccines. I did not know that there are neurotoxic aluminum and mercury molecules in vaccines. I did not know enough to research vaccines before vaccinating my own children. 
I did not know that my own precocious, active, talking son would be vaccine-injured. 
I did not know that my own baby brother (also an M.D.) would become paralyzed (Guillain-Barre) and then die after his swine flu vaccine in the same hospital (Shands) where he had received his medical training. 
I did not know that my mother(an R.N.) would get 8 vaccines in 1 day to "catch-up" with newly added CDC vaccines to keep her job as Head Nurse in the Largest Hospital in the county and then get such severe, aggressive, progressive brain fog in days and become unable to dial a phone or push an elevator button or remember any of her  5 children in a few weeks and then have this "dementia" progress and then die in diapers
I did not know that vaccines were given a blanket indemnity from liability in 1986 and now total immunity for all COVID vaccines for the future. I did not know that we gave more vaccines than any other country starting on day #1...I did not know that we have the highest rate of SIDS of the top 35 industrialized countries... I did not know that we had more autism than any other country... I did not know that Vaccines could injure an infant's brain. 
I did not know that vaccines can result in autoimmunity and neurological damage. I did not know that herd immunity does not apply to vaccines and is a myth created by the CDC. I did not know that Vaccines have almost no effect after about four years. 
I did not know how emotional the topic would be and how angry people would be at me for just asking questions about Vaccine Safety. I did not know that pediatricians were paid to give vaccines. I did not know that the CDC owned the Patents on so many vaccines. 
I did not know that the NIH stands to make Billions of dollars on a COVID vaccine. 
I did not know how angry at myself I would be for not knowing. I did not know that the CDC committed fraud and destroyed their evidence in their vaccine safety studies when it showed vaccines can cause autistic neurological changes..I did not know that a whistleblower came forward with all the evidence but he was silenced. I did not know that Merck committed fraud in their vaccine research repeatedly. I did not know that aluminum molecules in the vaccine ingredients is connected to brain inflammation and brain inflammation has been proven to be connected to autism. 
I did not know that vaccines contained human cells from aborted fetuses..
I did not know how much mainstream media would censor the independent research that showed these facts...I did not know that 90% of all vaccine research that the CDC and FDA use to "approve" vaccines are done by the scientists hired by vaccine makers..I did not know if we were alone... I did not know how many other millions of parents and families in the world have been affected by vaccine reactions..
I did not know how many would find, join, and share the Facebook help group= Vaccine Support Group on Facebook..I did not know that FB would delete the scientific medical research that had been suppressed, deleted, or censored until it happened to us...  Dr.MAS.. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Thanks for all the help and invaluable info! Much appreciated! Hope you’re moving to Atlanta!! Lol. I am too! 😊 </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 2> Everywhere you look on the internet you see WORK being offered ads posted by FEMA.

So, the US Government knows this situation is going to get much worse (FEMA job offerings) because they are the one's in charge of the situation.

These FEMA death camps were build 15 years ago so, what does that tell you.

The COVID19 throat swabs tainted with the virus ?

Will the vaccination shots give people the virus like the "flu shot" gives the elderly the flu ?

Government officials in other states are telling their citizens that there are dangers insects in the area and aircraft will be conducting an Ariel Spraying CAMPAIGN over their neighborhoods at sunset when people are at home.

People in the food processing industry are mysteriously becoming sick with COVID19 therefore, food shortages can arise.

The US Government is buying up all face masks and gloves then hiding them in warehouses in order to keep them out of the hands of needy citizens.

Secrecy behind the global 5G surveillance program and the widespectuum RF Radiation that is dangerous to people's health.

People and their families living on special Military bases since last year are restricted from television, raido, internet and all outside comuniciations with the outside world and these military personal are flying these high ALTITUDE aircraft that are spraying a mystery fluid into the air whereas these elongated offwhite clouds are seen everywhere.  

People in the News Media are observed smiling and with grinds on their faces when discussing the deadly global Pandemic.

No one person in the upper most portion of the US Government has ever been seen wearing a mask. Have they received a vaccination shot prior to the Pandemic ? </COMMENT 2>

<COMMENT 10> Update, this whole "virus" is the biggest fraud of the century. Before you discount me, look into how a virus was discovered so you can find out for yourself that the particle in question has never been proven to do harm, it was labeled a cause of sickness under no basis. In fact, its unknown where they come from. Viruses resemble exosomes exactly but were not called viruses, because unlike viruses they were actually studied and found to be made in our body. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> I am Native American,through long generations we made a tea that had white whiskey(small amt) juice of 1/2 lemon, water, sugar, peppermint, simmer on stove, drink glass while hot, then wrap up in blanket,,it never failed, I would sweat profusely and that morning the flu was gone or bad colds,. Thanks </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Hi I lost my smelling me to coming stomach pain also but when I went fever clinic they are telling nothing but still paining stomach what will I do please give me any suggestions </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Thank you Doctor Seheult for another informative medical presentation .
Scientific research verifies the efficient systems that evolution has provided us with .
When I suspect a viral infection in myself I resort to "sweating it out" .
I usually achieve this by the addition of extra blankets covering me while I sleep .
When I get too warm I instinctively wake up .
I ensure that I am sufficiently hydrated before this and after this .
I consider inducing a high temperature as duplicating or enhancing a natural function . </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Question: Since fever is beneficial in fighting a virus, could an elevated temperature from cardio exercise stop an early infection from progressing?  In nursing school (40 years ago), my A&P professor mentioned that going for a hard run when he felt a cold coming on (not if full on sick) seemed to stop the illness in its tracks.  Being a lifelong cardio addict, I began paying attention to this and it seemed to work for me as well.  I did have a few coughs which occasionally progressed to bronchitis while working; these were more frequent while caring for patients with extreme lung infections—but in general, I have been quite healthy.  After retirement 6 years ago, I continued to run, adding road cycling to my activities (40, 60, and even 100 miles), and haven’t had a single cough or cold since leaving bedside care.  So my real question is how protective cardio exercise might be during the COVID-19 pandemic. </COMMENT 14>

I was wiped out, awful head,  felt very strange like a severe cold without much catarrh and then a cough for over two weeks. I kept thinking I had a hair stuck in my throat. Anyway 5 days into this I woke up with conjunctivitis, never had it before </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Hi there, thanks for a very informative source of information.   I have been battling with a 'fever', for lack of a better name, for the past 10 years.  I just never get cold.  When the temperature outside drops it feels like my temp increases and I actually start perspiring.  I  thought it may initially have been to the change of life symptoms for women, but is it likely for such a long time.  I am now 55 years old.  I don't even own a jersey or jacket and find t-shirts very warm to wear. </COMMENT 18>

<COMMENT 13> Chinese doctors say people who are infected but who do not show symptoms can transmit virus. The ability of transmitting virus varies among such people, some stronger, some weaker.
http://sh.xinhuanet.com/2020-03/09/c_138857378.htm European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says "It is currently believed that people who are infected but who do not show symptoms cannot transmit the virus." I would trust Chinese doctors who are fighting the virus on the front line! What a tragedy! Is this because of language barrier? Or over confidence? https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/novel-coronavirus-china/questions-answers </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> What is "positive asymptomatic"? Can "asymptomatic" people transmit virus? The reporter invited Chen Dechang, the chairman of the National Critical Care Medicine Committee and director of the Department of Critical Care Medicine, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine to explain this.

"asymptomatic" people can transmit virus to different degrees, varying from strong to weak transmission level

Chen Dechang, who is currently treating critically ill COVID-19 patients in ​​Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, remembers that as soon as he arrived in Wuhan, the person in charge of the hospital stated that a small number of medical staff in the hospital showed positive in the throat swab test, but there were no symptoms of lung inflammation. To ensure safety, the hospital still keeps them in isolation.

"In general, asymptomatic positive is asymptomatic infection." Chen Dechang said that, like many other diseases, since the outbreak, there have also been a certain number of asymptomatic people who carry the new corona virus. "Generally speaking, this group of people has a strong immune function, and even if the body carries the virus, it will not cause large numbers of reproduction of virus or cause tissue and organ damage." Asymptomatic people have strong or weak ability to transmit the virus. When the virus load in the body reaches a higher quantity, it will have a stronger virus transmission capacity, but if the virus load in the asymptomatic one is lower, the ability to transmit the virus will also be relatively weak.

In addition, different virus subtypes have large differences in their ability to spread. Chen Dechang introduced that the National Science Review, sponsored by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, recently published a paper jointly completed by researchers at the Bioinformatics Center of the Peking University School of Life Sciences and the Shanghai Pasteur Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Recently, 149 mutation points were generated, and two subtypes have evolved, namely, the L subtype and the S subtype, which show great differences.

"The S subtype is a relatively older version, which is more similar to the bat-derived coronavirus in the phylogenetic tree, and is not as strong in transmission; the L subtype is more invasive and more infectious. This time in the Wuhan epidemic area, Large-scale transmission is more closely related to it. "He introduced that after studying 149 mutation points, scholars found that the L subtype is more common, accounting for 70%; the S subtype accounts for 30%. But whether asymptomatic infections are mostly S subtypes requires further understanding. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> I went to the Cortland NY Guthrie hospital last night and they refused to test me for anything but flu which was inconclusive. I had every symptom of covid19 and told them it's the sickest I've ever been. They gave me ibuprofen said that's all they can do there are no test for anything other than flu. So they say..
I probably don't have coronavirus but it would be nice to know foresure is a test really that expensive, that they can't afford to waste one. </COMMENT 15>

<COMMENT 7> I got a DVT and PE 2 weeks after ankle surgery. I felt the clot hit my lung. I got a feeling of doom and a tight hard feeling in my chest. My husband should hav come home to a dead wife. But I survived. I went the next day to the ER as I felt pretty bad. The doctor on duty left me on a gurney for 5 hours despite me telling him I had a DVT and PE. Finally, he came in after 10pm and told me all the ultrasound techs had gone home. He gave me a shot of heparin (in my arm muscle no less) and sent me home with instructions to make an appointment with the ultrasound clinic if I still felt I needed it. I was too sick to argue and went in the next day for the scan. The ultrasound tech was furious when she found the DVT and sent me for a chest X-ray and CT scan. So there it sat in my right lung. I spent 7 days on the pulmonary ward where I was the only person under 💯 years old!  How did I know I had the clot?  I was told by a strange voice that sounded like it came from next to me, not in my head. It was clear, sharp and urgent and caused me to take immediate action. Science does not account for these strange things. I wonder if medicine does. </COMMENT 7>

<COMMENT 16> I had the covid for 8 weeks at home, had to get on Rx oxygen, third week I got a DVT right leg, doubled in size, above knee (from the swelling and feel of it when I did walk, ) but I had been on the 90 essential nutrients, however I wasn't taking everything due to some nausea and not wanting to eat. so minimum, high dose vitamin C (12 grams a day) D (70, IU for one day, which knocked out headache and low fever), and A (200,000 IU for one day to knock out headache and low fever). SO back on the nattokinase I went only instead of 1 (6750 FU's) I was taking 5 , three times a day, about 2000 IU of E ( natural E) and 1000 mg of krill oil. That brought it down in about 4 weeks. One young actor was not so lucky, he was in ICU and lost his leg from DVT related to Covid. </COMMENT 16>

<COMMENT 10> I like the way you explained the corona affect our and really happens मुझे आपका का तरीका बेहद पसंद आया जिस प्रकार से अपने समझाया इस प्रकार से इस यूटयूब पर किसी ने नहीं समझाया है धन्यवाद👍👍 </COMMENT 10>

<COMMENT 12> THIS JUST BEGINS Personally, I realize that what is happening is only the beginning, but? It will be? Given that as humans we are destined to die but I don't know you I believe in God and maybe you should do the same but therefore we live and move on According to me from my point of view what is happening is only a small part of the beginning and I do not care if someone read this For my part, I say we still have a chance to make the change THE LIBERTY EXPRESSION. At another point others would say: PONTE Ah STUDY CHILD !!! : STOP SAYING MOM $ ¿# @% I care a% € & $ = # @ what you say . And lose because I know the way of acting of others but let me tell you something if we can't make the change ourselves at least let's encourage more people who are not too late yet SANTIAGO 2: 26 Because the body without spirit is dead to faith without debris is dead. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> I think sneezing coughing into elbow is silly  as if sneeze and not fast enough you will have bad stuff on elbow  the same elbow your meant to shake hands with?
Why do waiting in queues.  Isnt this more dangerous as in a queue wind is flying down possibly every person there? I am confused with these rules. Also spiders can go up into sky for miles? Sand from Sahara to uk after storm. Isnt flem going to float possibly miles not just dozen in a line but real spread. Finally sending yougest kids back to school? This would be last group to go back to school. This has many contradictions and many strange ways to stay uninfected? </COMMENT 13>

<COMMENT 15> Discovering viruses inside the body is like discovering sugar, salt, calcium, lipid in the blood or discovering sperms or ovum inside the reproductive organs or even discovering that we have a heart that beats. It is just stating the obvious. Fact is that we are a storehouse of millions of germs including viruses, bacteria that have been living inside our bodies from birth to death but do not cause any infection. Infection is caused only when our immunity power becomes weak and then too our bodies fight it out by itself thus making our bodies stronger than before. So please stop listening to the Pro $$$ titute media that has been paid a hefty package running to millions to spread this scaredemic called corona. Remember its the media that has played the satans role of spreading corona fear from the days of wuhan in december until the present and this has to be taken care of or else it will continue to ruin our lives. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Instead of fighting off the Coronavirus can’t we just make a medicine to boost our immune system? If we have a strong immune system the Coronavirus will go away eventually? I’m not sure </COMMENT 16>

From Doctor Strange,
This is only my point of view, might be
correct, may be wrong, I do not know.
I still say again and again that Stupid
Things, NEVER EXISTED at all in real
Life, but the question mark, how it became
existed? It became existed because so
many human believed its existed but
no doubt, in the first place its NEVER
Existed at any course, at any Time, at 
any Country. Because as we all know
when we talk about The Real Virus and
I am not talking about that Stupid Thing
that NEVER existed, easy to say, example,
when 3 people ate 1 food that consisted
of disease, so only 3 people got infected
not others, right. 
please look out my comments in FB:

So,.... Long Story To cut short, How To ensure 
That Stupid Thing To disappeared by itself
BY Disbelieve that stupid Thing, in other words
distancing our self from that stupid things
 so most probably it will Vanished from Human Life
Forever, all in Human Head....could try out.

thing, You will get Good Thing, Then and

That is SOUL CHEMISTRY Degree before all
The Doctors Could Hold A Doctor PHD Degree.

Some of the Questions Are;
1)   How To Understandable Human Soul?
2)   Is It useful To more understanding of
      Human/Patients reactions as and when

<COMMENT 1> Another portion of fake numbers about fake virus from Gates puppets. Nobody gets sick !!!! They claim that elderly people in seniors homes dying of Covid. Because this poor old people can't defend themselves. They not allow their families to see them or even not allowing decent funeral. They doing this to prepare this fake Covid numbers. I'm 100% sure that this elderly people dying of normal causes not of Covid. This people like this Bonnie Henry are disgusting. True pandemic is the pandemic of cancer because people like Bonnie and WHO poisoning our food. We buy food made of chemicals and plastic and people dying like crazy but this is not a problem for Bonnie and WHO this is their agenda. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> We have "anti-racism" rallies of thousands but churches are not allowed to have more than 50. This is an absolute joke. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> As long as ace is in Ottawa breaking the rules on covid-19 what you do is meaningless. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> what are the four "epi-cases"? are they people who were NOT diagnosed at the time as part of some cluster or whatever, but at some point in time it became clear that they had been infected but now today they are not sick and thus never participated in the usual diagnosed-and-then-recovered medical process, but they should be counted? or...um? </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> There were significant numbers of people travelling through Europe, and Eastern Canada, coming in flights from China.  That is not made clear in these stats.

It should also be made very in stats that it was staff returning to the senior's centres, bringing in the virus to the seniors NOT the seniors going out.  That is not emphasized in these stats, and I really think that should happen. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> If you got infected with say the Eastern Canada strain and you recovered from that, can you get reinfected with the other strains circulating around? Which strain is the most virulent? I should watch the whole video I guess before asking these questions. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> This Government and Health Authority have been quite forward thinking about our ability to get back to normal lives and production however there are lingering suggestions of continual contact tracing, isolation, quarantine and the need for a vaccine.  Is this Province going to institute the ability to monitor citizens  through apps etc to ensure the ability to continually quarantine the population or insist on vaccination?  Or assure us it will be voluntary but will use a bait and switch to say 'sure it's voluntary however if you would like to access stores, doctors, travel etc you will have to prove (by digital passport or some such) that you are vaccinated?' I would like to see BC continue to be forward thinking and see to the autonomy of our Province. </COMMENT 7>

<COMMENT 14> This pandemic is a huge farce I repeat this pandemic is a huge farce fact 1 as humans our immune system becomes stronger against viruses and sickness if we have contracted the virus 2 this so called virus has been blown out of proportion to the point that every one hides behind a mask WHICH WILL NOT PROTECT YOU FROM THE GOD DAMN DISEASE if you are stupid enough to believe that a mask will prevent you from contracting the disease your dumb AS FUCK this whole pandemic is a way to lower our immune systems so that way either when the next more deadly disease will kill so many more people that the world population will drop astronomically  or so that the social elite can make more money off a new mandatory vaccine because us humans finally got it through our thick fucking skulls that the flu mutates every year and the vaccine that they give you is for the previous years strand of flu so it is up to us humans to make the decision to either be with the 99% of people who believe this and are following the media like mindless sheeple or the 1% like me who are smart enough to realize that this whole thing is completely made up and we have no reason to worry about this so called pandemic and to all the people who will reply with things like “actually we should be very worried cause we’re a bunch of mindless fucking sheeple who HAVE NO IDEA HOW EVOLUTION WORKS AND WERE TO RETARDED TO FOGURE IT OUT WITHOUT OUR MOMMIES HOLDING OUR HANDS ALL THE THROUGH THIS BUT OH WAIT WERE NOT ALOUD TO BE WITHIN 6 FEET OF EACH OTHER

<COMMENT 17> The new coronavirus pneumonia is the influenza of unknown cause of death in the United States.

Asahi TV reported that as early as February 7, the United States CDC stated that "The symptoms of new coronavirus pneumonia and influenza are very similar." Some symptoms of new coronavirus pneumonia and influenza are the same, e.g., fever, cough, runny nose and shortness of breath. So, the United
States does not test these influenzae of unknown cause of death, and only generalize them as the influenza of unknown cause of death.

China has successfully tested these U.S. influenzae of unknown cause of death that are caused by the new coronavirus. Now these U.S. influenzae of unknown cause of death is called as new-coronavirus pneumonia. But unfortunately, China's successful test has not been appreciated by all countries of the world, but has been accused by all countries of the world under the leadership of the United States. If China adopts the U.S. approach, i.e., does not test influenza of unknown cause of death, and only generalize as the influenza of unknown cause of death, China will not become the source of the new coronavirus. </COMMENT 17>

<COMMENT 1> Someone said, "London can host the #Olympics in 2020."
How's going?😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Thanks China </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Don't worry guys, check Yashica video and leave your stress.  https://youtu.be/4cVcqy2ehEk </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> The UK should have gone into lockdown much, much earlier and the delay “cost lives”, according to an infectious disease expert who sits on the Sage committee. Professor John Edmunds insisted lives would have been saved had the Conservatives acted sooner. 
Cheers Boris Gump. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Hungary : altogether 525 deaths...not more.
(BCG vaccine) </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Government fiddling the figures to cover up their shameful failure- even so, 2nd most deaths in the world behind USA and 2nd most deaths per million behind Belgium. Johnson, Trump and Bolsonaro of Brazil, the three right wing extremist mugs, have most deaths on their grubby hands, almost half the world's total. And all three are proud of their handling of the crisis. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> This is how many people that think Sky news is giving fake info😒 </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Craziest news headline of all time:

Sex is now illegal. Lol This is George Orwell or Kafkaesque type absurdity. The idea any government has the right to prohibit sex. And how would they enforce it? Lol Sex Police on patrol. 😄 </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> I have little faith in sky news reporting of this.  This hasn't been helped by the over-simplification and outright fakery of some of the figures they're quoting. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> The games rigged people are starting to see the medias lies and deception. Just trying to fulfil there agenda. They want complete and utter control of our lives! </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Bullshite </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> We'll see if more social contact has increased the spread of the virus? I'm no doctor but I think I got a damn good guess. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Q </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> So basically. No one died FROM coronavirus. Only WITH the coronavirus. Didn't see everyone one going crazy when the flu caused an early death. Speaking of which does that not exist anymore? </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> unbelieveable! </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> I thought this was a joke like this was like um like a meme </COMMENT 16>

What if in theory covid 19 was actually an ancient virus frozen for milenia in some mamoth or something and global warming causeed it to thaw out unleashing it upon the world. And what if scientist are looking at this thing the wrong way. What if they need instead of looking at it from an evolution of pathology, they should be looking at it from a de evolution point of view.

<COMMENT 5> Thank you very very good point </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> The most important thing about the video is how it reflects on the contexts that society must be very clear about the Covid-19, the appreciation it makes so that those who watch the video generate criteria to differentiate what a syndrome is and how it is it is a symptom and how these influenced the impact of each country. In my reflection of the video on this pandemic for my consideration, we have also forgotten how this problematic affected social and economic levels of each family in the world, it is said that poverty increased by 30% and malnutrition in children by 45%. </COMMENT 6>

<COMMENT 7> Great just turn the treb down a bit ;) </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Well done! </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> You know, it is possible to multitrack in tune. You just need to pay attention to the placement and intonation of notes as they appear in the chord. Eg. A major third is flatter by about 12 to 16 cents than if it were in root position and a minor third is even flatter. Just FYI, you might've gone viral but I don't think many musicians will have helped you do that. If you have any musical integrity maybe work a little harder at getting it right. I had to turn off halfway through as the clash in tones and intonation was unbearable. But that's just me. A lot of people will be scratching their heads saying, "It sounds great to me" but they won't be musicians. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> But it's not in tune! It's a basic box type multitrack that has been extremely badly mixed! I have done this type of multitrack (not on this account) and sorry but to do it this way does NOT take long. To do it the way Jacob Collier does it takes a lot of time but this is the most basic type of multitrack. It's badly sung and out of tune.......bloody awful.  How the hell did this go viral...I'm a musician. A successful session musician and sorry but if you think this is great you must be tone-deaf.....I guess there is a lot of tone-deaf people out there. </COMMENT 10>

<COMMENT 14> There are many variables that make this presentation incomplete. This should be  compared and combined with other data and re-evaluated. For one, not a single "lilypad" is the same. Some are healthier than others. Second, lets not forget the impact of the environment we live in. The world is a big place, and some places are downright toxic for humans but a breeding ground for viruses, and vice versa: some places are good for humans to live in, but are deadly for viruses. There are just too many other aspects that, when taken into consideration, would deliver a more accurate presentation -- especially since we've learnt a lot more about the virus by now. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> So 'flattening the curve' means 'lengthening the curve'? </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Let’s not forget about the other ways people will suffer with this virus as some politicians keep people from working. Must be nice to be rich and not worry about such things. Perhaps shove sock people into nursing homes...yeah, that’ll help. </COMMENT 16>

<COMMENT 14> This pandemic is a huge farce I repeat this pandemic is a huge farce fact 1 as humans our immune system becomes stronger against viruses and sickness if we have contracted the virus 2 this so called virus has been blown out of proportion to the point that every one hides behind a mask WHICH WILL NOT PROTECT YOU FROM THE GOD DAMN DISEASE if you are stupid enough to believe that a mask will prevent you from contracting the disease your dumb AS FUCK this whole pandemic is a way to lower our immune systems so that way either when the next more deadly disease will kill so many more people that the world population will drop astronomically  or so that the social elite can make more money off a new mandatory vaccine because us humans finally got it through our thick fucking skulls that the flu mutates every year and the vaccine that they give you is for the previous years strand of flu so it is up to us humans to make the decision to either be with the 99% of people who believe this and are following the media like mindless sheeple or the 1% like me who are smart enough to realize that this whole thing is completely made up and we have no reason to worry about this so called pandemic and to all the people who will reply with things like “actually we should be very worried cause we’re a bunch of mindless fucking sheeple who HAVE NO IDEA HOW EVOLUTION WORKS AND WERE TO RETARDED TO FOGURE IT OUT WITHOUT OUR MOMMIES HOLDING OUR HANDS ALL THE THROUGH THIS BUT OH WAIT WERE NOT ALOUD TO BE WITHIN 6 FEET OF EACH OTHER

<COMMENT 17> The new coronavirus pneumonia is the influenza of unknown cause of death in the United States.

Asahi TV reported that as early as February 7, the United States CDC stated that "The symptoms of new coronavirus pneumonia and influenza are very similar." Some symptoms of new coronavirus pneumonia and influenza are the same, e.g., fever, cough, runny nose and shortness of breath. So, the United
States does not test these influenzae of unknown cause of death, and only generalize them as the influenza of unknown cause of death.

China has successfully tested these U.S. influenzae of unknown cause of death that are caused by the new coronavirus. Now these U.S. influenzae of unknown cause of death is called as new-coronavirus pneumonia. But unfortunately, China's successful test has not been appreciated by all countries of the world, but has been accused by all countries of the world under the leadership of the United States. If China adopts the U.S. approach, i.e., does not test influenza of unknown cause of death, and only generalize as the influenza of unknown cause of death, China will not become the source of the new coronavirus. </COMMENT 17>

<COMMENT 3> Ozone therapy and Plasma therapy

Dr Amato De Monte director of the anesthesia and resuscitation department of the University health compagny of Udine treated 36 covid-19 patients in Italy
 with ozone therapy. 
All patients had pneumonia with respiratory difficulty and were doing oxygen terapy with a cap or helmet.

All patients improve after 3-5 ozone therapy sessions.

Many patients were discharged from the hospital and the only patient who was subsequently intubated was extubated.

You don't have to wait for the patient to be intubated but you have to start treatment in the early stages.

After the first cases treated by Amato De Monte, a clinical trial began in various italian hospitals with ozone therapy.

The results have been excellent, they can be read on the website www.ossigenoozonoterapia.it or you can write to info@ossigenoozono.it

Dr Giuseppe De Donno head of the pneumology department Carlo Poma of Mantua in Italy has obtained excellent results with plasma therapy.

He also treated a pregnant woman with plasma therapy, he was the first in the world. </COMMENT 3>

<COMMENT 4> Why do doctors always have the need to probe peoples holes? There is no way i am going for this test unless they come up with a less invasive method of collecting the specimens. I am also not going for a prostate exam. The US the other day said they have evidence that aliens exist. It enough having to worry about aliens probing your ass.

<COMMENT 9> Excessive dependence of humans on tools and machines to diagonse disesase has become the bane of modern medicine. The result of this is that perfectly healthy humans are converted into patients merely by the readings of the tools and machines. For example, a healthy person is branded a diabetic patient just because the readings show an elevated blood sugar level which in itself means nothing. Then starts the actual business of life long dependecy on modern medicines which are bascially chemicals that do not cure but only treat the sugar level while makiing the person internally weak by cuasing damage to the vital organs like heart, pancreas and kidenys. similarly, testing for corona virus in the body which is already livinng in harmony in our bodies from birth to death amongst crores of other germs is only misleading and trapping people by branding them as corona patients. Fact is having the corona virus is not equal to having the corona disease but the media, IMA, IMCR ,the governemtn and pharma lobby is making us believe as though a mere virus inside our body is the same as having the disease. We need to understeand this conspiracy of the medical system or else we will continue to suffer as 'patients' for newer and newer diseases in addtion to existing but manufactured diseases like diabetes, heart problems, kidney problems, asthma etc. </COMMENT 9>

<COMMENT 15> Let me give you 2 examples from commercially available PCR tests being used these days , I shall quote from the labels, the company labels that come with these tests : - Abbott : "Positive results do not rule out bacterial infection or co-infection with other viruses...Due to the high sensitivity of the assays run on the instrument, contamination of the work area with previous positive samples may cause false positive results" ; - Accula : " Cross-reactivity with respiratory tract organisms other than those listed in the Analytical Specificity Study may lead to erroneous results…" : what they are saying is : we cannot guarantee through our test that you are positive to sars-cov-2 because our test may confuse sars-cov-2 with everything else, any other kind of RNA in your cells or other things !!! It´s a hoax, it´s a swindle, it is global pharma nazism to terrorize us all into buying their useless and harmful vaccines and drugs and face masks and disinfectants that will only cause one allergies and poisonings, and accept total control of our lives, contact tracing etc., under the false pretext of a pandemic that does NOT exist. 
THERE IS NO SARS-COV-2 virus no covid disease no pandemic it´s all a pharmanazi hoax for profit :

<COMMENT 8> Well done! </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> You know, it is possible to multitrack in tune. You just need to pay attention to the placement and intonation of notes as they appear in the chord. Eg. A major third is flatter by about 12 to 16 cents than if it were in root position and a minor third is even flatter. Just FYI, you might've gone viral but I don't think many musicians will have helped you do that. If you have any musical integrity maybe work a little harder at getting it right. I had to turn off halfway through as the clash in tones and intonation was unbearable. But that's just me. A lot of people will be scratching their heads saying, "It sounds great to me" but they won't be musicians. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> But it's not in tune! It's a basic box type multitrack that has been extremely badly mixed! I have done this type of multitrack (not on this account) and sorry but to do it this way does NOT take long. To do it the way Jacob Collier does it takes a lot of time but this is the most basic type of multitrack. It's badly sung and out of tune.......bloody awful.  How the hell did this go viral...I'm a musician. A successful session musician and sorry but if you think this is great you must be tone-deaf.....I guess there is a lot of tone-deaf people out there. </COMMENT 10>

<COMMENT 14> There are many variables that make this presentation incomplete. This should be  compared and combined with other data and re-evaluated. For one, not a single "lilypad" is the same. Some are healthier than others. Second, lets not forget the impact of the environment we live in. The world is a big place, and some places are downright toxic for humans but a breeding ground for viruses, and vice versa: some places are good for humans to live in, but are deadly for viruses. There are just too many other aspects that, when taken into consideration, would deliver a more accurate presentation -- especially since we've learnt a lot more about the virus by now. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> So 'flattening the curve' means 'lengthening the curve'? </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Let’s not forget about the other ways people will suffer with this virus as some politicians keep people from working. Must be nice to be rich and not worry about such things. Perhaps shove sock people into nursing homes...yeah, that’ll help. </COMMENT 16>

<COMMENT 3> I feel like someone is cornering Covid-19. Excellent job. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> COVID-19 patients have ARDS symptoms, but they DO NOT actually have ARDS! 
WHY? Because there is no ACE2 Blocked Receptor CAUSED REDUCTION IN ALVEOLI SURFACTANT IN NORMAL ARDS!  And furthermore, COVID-19 patients DO NOT have "tired" diaphragm muscles or any danger of heart failure (unless they have a pre-existing heart disease co-morbitiy, which is not the norm).

That is why doctors, after inadvertently causing the death of tens of thousands of COVID-19 patients, have begun to turn patients face down, so the excess lung fluid does not inhibit oxygenation until the virus can be gotten under control, and, instead of intubing the patient with a ventilator, given them high-flow nasal cannulas (HFNC).
Hyperparic Oxygen would be an even better therapy.

<COMMENT 9> or if you lungs are being 'cooked' by millimeter microwave 5 gee.  Being rolled out RIGHT NOW ALL OVER THE US!... Liars. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> A recently published Swiss study performed a virtual screening of over 606 million compounds with the ambition to discover novel inhibitors for the SARS-CoV-2 main protease. To this date, the study marks the most extensive computational screening for the discovery of SARS-CoV-2 Main protease inhibitors: https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Inhibitors_for_Novel_Coronavirus_Protease_Identified_by_Virtual_Screening_of_687_Million_Compounds/11923239 




They report two natural compounds, (-)-taxifolin and rhamnetin. 

The first shows the best potential among the natural compounds. Remarkably, it is engaged in six direct hydrogen bonds with the Mpro which represents the highest count observed in the selection of compounds. Since hydrogen bonds are a key determinant for drug speciﬁcity, (-)-taxofolin might oﬀer a naturally occurring alternative to the proposed inhibitors CP-1 to CP-12.

The isomer (+)-taxifolin, which is more common in plants, was predicted to have less favourable binding free energies. However, the persian walnut (Juglans regia), Agrimonia pilosa, and japanese cypress (Chamaecyparis obtusa) among others are known to produce glycosides of (-)-taxofolin oﬀering a natural resource for its extraction. 

Glycosylated ﬂavonoids regularly show an increased bioavailability compared to the aglycon. In the organism, these glycosides are cleaved oﬀ by β-glucosidase in the gastrointestinal tract or liver. Since the aglycon already exhibits acceptable pharmacokinetics in rabbits, glycosylated (-)-taxifolin will likely display improved bioavailability as well. 




Taxifolin 3-O-glucoside isomers, [(2R, 3R)-, (2R, 3S)-, (2S, 3R)- and (2S, 3S)-] were isolated from leaves of Chamaecyparis obtuse (Cupressaceae). The (2S, 3S) isomer is a synonym of the (-)-Taxifolin 

https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10575630290033141?journalCode=gnpl19




So according to the results of the Swiss study, Chamaecyparis obtusa leaves can be used as a source of (-)-Taxifolin glycoside to inhibits the virus Main protease (3CLpro) in addition to the use of its oil as a source of phytoncides to mimic the “forest bath” effect.




Interestingly the study also found that among the FDA-approved drugs, Apixaban showed the highest potential, while Rivaroxaban and Betrixaban came 4th and 5th respectively, all three are anti-coagulants. 

We already know that blood clots are common issue with COVID-19 patients. It has also been shown that as a consequence of the elevated presence of blood clots among some COVID-19 patients, high plasmin levels are found. Plasmin was shown to promote the virus entry into cells using ACE2 by cleaving its spike protein: https://neurosciencenews.com/coronavirus-blood-clotting-16185/  https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00013.2020?utm_source=PRV&utm_medium=PressRelease&utm_campaign=4.16.2020&  




Apixaban and Rivaroxaban are already being used in protocols for treating COVID-19 patients in several hospitals, for example: https://emergencymedicinecases.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/COVID-19-Anticoagulation-Algorithm-version_final_1.1.pdf  




So their potential to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro may add up to the logic of using these drugs with COVID-19 patients as anti-coagulants.




The study screening process:

In the ﬁrst step, they performed a shape-based screening with known binders for the SARS-CoV-1 main protease and relevant 3 substructures as template molecules. After the initial shape screening, two diﬀerent docking protocols were applied followed by the assessment with pharmacokinetic ﬁlters to narrow down the number of potential binders. Clustering based on molecular ﬁngerprints was applied to ensure structural diversity of the compounds that were, in the next step, subjected to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Based on the obtained trajectories, the binding free energy of the ligands was quantiﬁed using Molecular Mechanics/Generalized Born Surface Area (MM/GBSA) post-processing. In the last step, they assessed potential toxic eﬀects of the compounds due to the interaction with 16 known oﬀ-targets to make a ﬁnal selection of 12 compounds. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Why is obesity such a problem with covid-19 is it because you have to administer air/oxygen according to weight?  Maybe because circulation is already affected by extra weight? </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> How can we find out if people who are dying of coronavirus have had the flu shot or multiple years of flu shots? How can this information be obtained? If the inflammation is being caused by an overreaction of the immune system, could this be caused by the flu shot? However, if the severe cases have not had the flu shot, then this would be a positive for getting the flu shot. Curiously, nothing about this is mentioned. I wonder why? </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> it is clear by the reaserch done in italy. its clot ! in china they have done only two autopsy, in Italy are doing a proper study through autopsy. anticoagulation teraphy is the most likely correct answer. ventilator are killing people and we all know that! </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Another great presentation. As a cardiologist I appreciate the information and the way it is presented. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> If ventilation is relatively intact and perfusion is compromised why is VA/Q ratio LOW?
It is supposed to be high isn't it? </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Thank you Dr. Seheult for being a voice of scientific reason during this very scary pandemic. With respect to the risk of possible lung injury by using ventilators to treat ARDS as opposed to treating symptoms of HAPE, could you address your thoughts on the possible use of Acetazolamide, Nifedipine and Phosodiesteras Inhibitors as potential countermeasures to treat the symptoms of Covid-19. For your convenience,  a link to a relevant paper published from the Cureus site is provided. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340066464_COVID-19_Nifedipine_Phoshpdiesterase_Inhibitors_Acetazolamide </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Question. How is the High Altitude drug doing with Covid-19? Thank you </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> QUESTION. I heard that the big cities in China, other than Wuhan, didn't get Covid-19 spread. Is that true??? Also, I heard that no Chinese head Government officials got Covid-19. Is that true?? Thank you </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Are you afraid of death? Not sure what I should do? Jesus is the solver. Jesus is the savior. Jesus is the only light in the chaotic world. Satan deceives you. What has Satan given you? It's all about cheating, lying, killing, stealing, and perishing. Come to Jesus. Rest and receive eternal life. In front of Jesus' name, all powers and demons kneel down. I am the way, the truth, and the life. Only  comes to the Father except through me. John 14: 6
You who want to believe in Jesus.If you who have COVID19, come to Jesus. Be healed in the name of Jesus, If you plagued by ghosts. If you wanna believe Jesus, Please say this words. "Jesus, I believe in Jesus. Jesus is the Son of God and my savior. you poured water and blood on the cross for my sins.And Jesus were resurrection in three days and I believe Jesus come back when in last world time." </COMMENT 19>

I wonder if there’s not an underlying exhaustion among the working classes, so in a way part of our collective psyche was like, yeah, let’s take the hit and feel more human and less machine for a while.

<COMMENT 5> As per my research  biggest GAMBLE  in Economic WORLD  is  3  things

AUTOMOBILES
CONSTRUCTION REAL ESTATE
BANKING  FINANCE  LEVERAGE

AUTOMOBILES  are actually  fully Automated  business  where  3000  parts  are either  manufactured  or  procured from vendours......

ITS  BIGGEST   GAMBLE  ON EARTH   TODAY  when well paid  JOBS   are  missing from  countries  towns  and cities.......even for  most  well educated  citizens........

Who  will  BUY   COSTLY   AUTOMOBILES  & CARS  without  JOB  AND  MONTHLY  SALARY  ??????
♒♒♒♒♒♏♏♏♏♏♒♒♒♏
CONSTRUCTION=====its  biggest  GAMBLE  ON  EARTH  today  in Every country.........
♒♒♒♏♏♏♏♏♏♏♏♏♏♏
Banking  hugely  under  BAD  LOANS  & NPA'S  GLOBALLY.....HSBC  TO DEUTCHE BANK  all  cutting  jobs  ..........

I cannot  speak more...........world  is into deeeeeep recession.......bigger  then 2008  USA SUB--PRIME  PROBLEM   in every country.........people will  REVOLT   IF   LOCK DOWN  IS  OPEN  WITHOUT   HOMEWORK.......and  RU68  KNOWS  that  he will  not  do  his homework  alone in life without  his FEMALE LOVE  at his home  to ENJOY  HAPPY  LOVED  LIFE  ........

<COMMENT 1> Total crap and they know it, there's more than twice the amount of deaths due to the covid -19 unreported that patients wasn't tested espically in March and April that not on the total amount of deaths so Matt give us the correct total 100,000 more like it.As it's alot worse than previously thought no wonder it's been mishandled from the very start an investigation is needed </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Says COVID-18 instead of 19 😂 </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Even with the Tories' desperately fiddled figures (far below the reality), UK has officially 2nd most Covid deaths in the world, behind Trumpland. Only 6 other countries have even 1/4 the number of deaths. Setting aside San Marino and Andorra, both tiny enclaves in Covid hotspots, UK is 2nd behind Belgium for deaths per million. Little wonder the Tories don't show the international graphs- and the media cover up for them. Catastrophic handling of the crisis by blustering buffoon Boris, his Dominatrix Cummings and Goings and their cronies, and yet he is proud of what they have done! Failure with herd immunity policy, care homes (didn't even bother to count the deaths for a month), PPE, testing (too late, missed targets and had to fiddle the figures) and tracing. Now they'll be making face coverings compulsory on public transport after saying face masks were counterproductive, and they are to quarantine foreigners, despite having already allowed thousands in for football matches from raging Covid hotspots. Oh, and Cheltenham races was another breeding ground they were warned against. They should be hung, drawn and quartered </COMMENT 3>

<COMMENT 4> A lot of doctors are beginning to think maybe mechanical ventilation may not be correct initially. Some of these pts are coming in with SATs of 50% with no distress!  They are not struggling to breathe as with ARDS. They have named this happy hypoxemia! A Dr Joseph Fair had the virus and waited too long before calling 911 and going to the ED. They asked him if he wanted to be intubated. Naturally as a doctor he said no. Instead they gave him very high % oxygen. It worked. A lot of frontline doctors are rethinking immediately going to the ventilator. </COMMENT 4>

<COMMENT 11> Is is true, as I have read, that 50-80% of covid-19 patients who go onto a vent die on the vent? If it is true, then we shouldn't look at the vent as a life-saver, or rather we shouldn't think that if we get into that kind of trouble, the vent will save us. It won't save a large percent of those who go onto one, and even it you do survive, you may have sustained significant lung damage that will be with you for the rest of your life. So I would think that the main life-saving, if it is to occur at all, would happen by the proper treatment early on, 'before' ventilation becomes the only resort and too often the 'last' resort. </COMMENT 11>

<COMMENT 18> As a Respiratory Therapist of 33 years, We also used etoh as a bronchial dilator which also broke the surfactent level   of the mucus bearer That made it possible to sucking the fluid out every 2 -3 hours. We called it or nick named it as a COPD  Cocktail.  Today the use of Peep and negative pressure on the newer Ventilators is simply outstanding. There is another form of life saving measures being carried out , and , that is Hyperbaric  ventilation. Used , for a wide variety of traumas  to the lung. </COMMENT 18>

<COMMENT 20> Congratulations!
The video is very well made in that it gives so much detail and I enjoyed it thoroughly.  
I am not in the medical profession but I have an immense hunger for knowledge and research, to equip myself with the facts and because the video was so in detail it sent my mind on further research to make sure I understand all fully and that process is leading to a question.

I understand from the video that during “Covid-19” the interstitial fluid in the interstitial space becomes inflamed [03:43] and because of the inflammation in the interstitial space spontaneous diffusion between the oxygen in the alveoli and the capillary is strained or even not existent at all and therefore the need to be incubated with a ventilator so assist with breathing during ‘Covid-19”

My question is: 
If the inflammation present in interstitial space renders spontaneous diffusion between alveoli and the capillary impossible then it appears the situation will not be remedied by a ventilator because even if one tries to breath normally, use a CPAP, another device or a ventilator surely the blockage cause by the inflamed interstitial fluid is present in all cases which make spontaneous diffusion labored or not possible, and I don’t believe that a ventilator can clear up the inflammation in interstitial space to begin with.  Can you please elaborate on this.

thanks in advance

<COMMENT 2> Gulp </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> why are you not telling the truth about where the Covid -19 virus actually came from. It was not from an animal to human. </COMMENT 3>

<COMMENT 10> Thanks to the nurses who gave their lives to cure strangers in need. 🙏🏼 </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Mutated. Covid 19 fatality rate > elderly. Quarantine, testing. 80% mild. ARDS: fluid build up. Cough/Sneeze spreads. Incubation period 5 days. Ro= how quickly it spreads. PR+PCR Test.  Supportive care. Clinical trials with Meds. Mask & self  quarantine. Human to dog transmission. High Risk: self quarantine. N95 mask for healthcare workers. Healthcare workers: PPE. N95 respirator. SARS CoV-2 causes COVID 19. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Warning! The moment you are reading this. There is a deadly virus that is killing millions! So help yourself by washing your hands when you’re going to eat. Also, bring some hand sanitizer when you go out so your hands stay clean. Stay safe, friend. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> I LOVE your citations at the end. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Study based on china mortality so some fact are wrong because china miss guiding with data </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Honestly, you can’t even get a break off of the news carrying on about COVID-19, I’m not saying that they shouldn’t but nobody actually gets it anyways most of the time. I can’t even cough or sneeze once without some imbecile thinking I have the "Coronavirus”. In my opinion everyone is kind of taking it a bit too serious. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Where's your proof that it went into a pangulen? Or are you being a parrot. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> It's sad that it took COVID-19 to bring us together. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> So somebody shagged a Pangolin after stuffing a dead Bat up it's arse and that's where this codswallop comes from,Thank fuck our government loves us. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Best Covid19 SarsCov2 awareness video..

Although people MUST wear face masks while going out.. Symptomatic or not..

Hats off for the tribute to Dr. Li in the end.

<COMMENT 3> And I wander if being a loner makes me stupid still. People are just a literal Payne in my respiratory system. Oh wait. I dont hang around people I stick to myself. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> A lot of doctors are beginning to think maybe mechanical ventilation may not be correct initially. Some of these pts are coming in with SATs of 50% with no distress!  They are not struggling to breathe as with ARDS. They have named this happy hypoxemia! A Dr Joseph Fair had the virus and waited too long before calling 911 and going to the ED. They asked him if he wanted to be intubated. Naturally as a doctor he said no. Instead they gave him very high % oxygen. It worked. A lot of frontline doctors are rethinking immediately going to the ventilator. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Another khan academy video </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> I came across a book that discusses Cytikine Storms. It says that the HMGB1 needs to be reduced. It suggested several herbs: Angelica sinensis; Salvia miltiorrhiza; licorice constituent glycerrhizin directly binds. Green tea component epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) also inhibits ; counterintuitively nicotine also lowers it. The pharmaceutical minocycline can be helpful. I hope this helps. </COMMENT 6>

<COMMENT 11> Is is true, as I have read, that 50-80% of covid-19 patients who go onto a vent die on the vent? If it is true, then we shouldn't look at the vent as a life-saver, or rather we shouldn't think that if we get into that kind of trouble, the vent will save us. It won't save a large percent of those who go onto one, and even it you do survive, you may have sustained significant lung damage that will be with you for the rest of your life. So I would think that the main life-saving, if it is to occur at all, would happen by the proper treatment early on, 'before' ventilation becomes the only resort and too often the 'last' resort. </COMMENT 11>

Is ARDS NEW ?? IS IT NOVEL? WHY ARE HOSPITALS PAID PER PATIENT ON VENTILATOR? 
This is </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> To put it simply for you, WASH your Hands, and when you think that they are clean,  THEN wash them again. Maybe you will survive. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> As a Respiratory Therapist of 33 years, We also used etoh as a bronchial dilator which also broke the surfactent level   of the mucus bearer That made it possible to sucking the fluid out every 2 -3 hours. We called it or nick named it as a COPD  Cocktail.  Today the use of Peep and negative pressure on the newer Ventilators is simply outstanding. There is another form of life saving measures being carried out , and , that is Hyperbaric  ventilation. Used , for a wide variety of traumas  to the lung. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> They did this to my mother but still she was unable to survive the reason was ARDS due to COVID19. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Congratulations!
The video is very well made in that it gives so much detail and I enjoyed it thoroughly.  
I am not in the medical profession but I have an immense hunger for knowledge and research, to equip myself with the facts and because the video was so in detail it sent my mind on further research to make sure I understand all fully and that process is leading to a question.

I understand from the video that during “Covid-19” the interstitial fluid in the interstitial space becomes inflamed [03:43] and because of the inflammation in the interstitial space spontaneous diffusion between the oxygen in the alveoli and the capillary is strained or even not existent at all and therefore the need to be incubated with a ventilator so assist with breathing during ‘Covid-19”

<COMMENT 2> Good thing I graduated army training this past December. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Bruh I just got outta basic and there were 20+ cases of Covid in my platoon alone. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Currently at basic and just finished during this, covid made this crap suck at fort Sill </COMMENT 4>

<COMMENT 7> The lockdown paranoia has gone on long enough. Change my mind </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> I was wondering about the impacts this pandemic has on the Army, weeeekkkks ago. I wasn't finding any really informative videos about this. Thank you Insider! </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Basic training not boot camp </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> We spent a lot of money on army but not on things that matter </COMMENT 10>

<COMMENT 14> Hey! Tactical dispersion! </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> So if none of them are sick going in, and they continue to do screenings, they've been in for more than 2 weeks and still no cases, why tf do they gotta social distance </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> The United States has encouraged Belarus to conclude and adhere to
agreements with the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
on the program of macroeconomic stabilization and related reform measures, as
well as to undertake increased privatization and to create a favorable climate
for business and investment. Although there has been some American direct
private investment in Belarus, its development has been relatively slow given
the uncertain pace of reform


how about u treat "europeans"(russians) the same way u treat
arabs mr trump?


uncertain pace of reform means i take ur money and do nothing


shame on the usa </COMMENT 16>

<COMMENT 2> merci pour la video courte et simple cela va être utile pour mon projet d'ecriture </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Jai une bpco  stade 2 avancée...auel serait la conséquence avec se virus qui attaque directement les bronche sur ma santé ?   évidemment j'attends pas une réponse d'elle...peut quelqu un et dans ma situation.... </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> J'ai attrapé le covid19 le mois dernier. Certes je me sens guéri actuellement mais j'ai l'impression d'avoir une insuffisance respiratoire. J'ai du mal à respirer comme avant. Cette insuffisance n'est pas accentuée car il m'arrive de faire des activités physiques mais jsuis vite essoufflé du coup que faire pour retrouver ma respiration à 100%
Sur une échelle de 1 à 10 ( ma capacité à respirer)
Disons que j en suis à 7 
Merci de me répondre </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> ...ne dites pas "il n'existe pas de traitement" c'est faux, la chloroquine combinée à l'azithromycine, qui est un antibiotique, en est un et il fonctionne dans la majorité des cas traités ! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfiUlVpqHfE </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Bonjour, Avez-vous eu des retours sur une atteinte du myocarde après avoir contracté le covid-19 ? Merci </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> une reaction immunitaire(inflammatoire) hors controle par l'organisme lui méme,c'est la redoutable toxicité de ce virus.
comme si l'infection devenait une maladie auto-immune .
Neamoins ce phenomene est connu, semble -t-il,dans d 'autres atteintes pulmonaires, comment ce fait il,que nous
soyons si demunis de solutions? </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Vous dites qu'il s'agit d'eau dans le poumon mais est ce comparable a un oedeme pulmonaire dans quel cas l'usage de diueretique pourrait s'averer opportun ? </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Bien Le Bonjour , pouvez vous nous expliquer le protocole de réanimation ? Par exemple pourquoi doit-on retourner les malade sur le ventre ... ? </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Ça s'appelle une embolie pulmonaire </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Si il y a une réaction exacerbée de nos défenses immunitaires qui engendre une forte inflammation est ce que les immunosuppresseurs sont protecteurs ? </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Pourquoi certaines personnes deviennent-elles gravement malades à cause d'un coronavirus, alors que d'autres sont asymptomatiques et ne ressentent presque rien?

Trois raisons :

·   Les problèmes de santé (86,5 % des décès à New York présentent au moins une comorbidité)

·   Choix de mode de vie

·   Vos gènes

Analysons ce dernier point.
Si vous comprenez vos gènes, vous pouvez mettre en œuvre des changements de régime alimentaire, de compléments et de mode de vie qui peuvent optimiser votre santé et vous rendre plus résistant au COVID-19 et aux complications qui y sont liées.

Nous sommes au XXIe siècle et nous ne devrions plus avoir besoin de nous fier aux suppositions généralistes du XXe siècle pour savoir ce qui peut aider alors que la connaissance des prédispositions permet d’adapter plus efficacement les stratégies préventives.
Ceux qui ont fait séquencer leur génome disposent des outils nécessaires pour se concentrer sur l’utile et comprendre ce qui pourrait les aider en examinant leur ADN.

Nos gènes peuvent nous dire si nous avons des variantes à risque ou non qui :

·   Nous rendent plus susceptibles de contracter un coronavirus

·   Nous rendent plus susceptibles de développer des complications

Certaines sociétés analysant le génome sont capables d’établir une liste interne de recommandations permettant de contrecarrer les variantes génétiques qui pourraient vous mettre en danger.

Trois exemples clés :

·   Le gène ACE2 - Entrée dans vos cellules

Considérez les récepteurs ACE2 comme des portes d'entrée pour le coronavirus, car c'est ainsi qu'il peut pénétrer dans vos cellules.
Plus de récepteurs ACE2 signifie plus de portes pour que le coronavirus puisse facilement entrer dans vos cellules et les « hacker ».

Votre gène ACE2 joue un rôle important dans le nombre de récepteurs dont vous disposez.
Certaines variantes sont associées à une expression accrue des récepteurs ACE2, si bien que si vous êtes porteur de cette variante, vous pourriez être plus susceptible de contracter le virus.

L’intérêt de savoir est que si vous savez de quelle variante vous êtes porteur, vous saurez quelle mesure préventive vous devez prendre pour essayer d'empêcher que vos récepteurs ACE2 ne facilitent l’entrée du COVID-19.
L’analyse personnalisées permet de prendre des mesures préventives basées sur vos gènes.

 

·   Gène MX1 - Empêcher le virus de se propager

Le MX1 est important pour la réponse de l'organisme aux virus qu'il n'a jamais rencontrés auparavant.
Comme le COVID-19 est nouveau, ce gène joue un rôle important dans la lutte contre les coronavirus.

Le gène MX1 code pour une protéine qui aide à empêcher les virus de se répliquer et de se propager dans l'organisme.
Malheureusement, les coronavirus peuvent supprimer cette protéine, ce qui permet aux virus de se reproduire sans que le MX1 ne les en empêche.

Cependant, certaines variantes génétiques permettent au MX1 de fonctionner par d'autres moyens, malgré l'interférence des coronavirus.

Si vous savez que vous possédez la variante à risque du MX1, assurez-vous de mettre en œuvre certaines recommandations spécifiques.

 

·   Gène IL-6 - Tempêtes de cytokines

Le gène IL-6 est SUPER important pour le COVID-19. 
À vérifier en premier quand c’est possible.

Ce gène est associé à 3 aspects liés au COVID-19 :

·   Sensibilité aux infections respiratoires

·   Tempêtes de cytokines

·   SDRA (syndrome de détresse respiratoire aiguë)

Les tempêtes de cytokines surviennent lorsque le système immunitaire surproduit des cytokines inflammatoires, qui endommagent alors notre corps au lieu de le protéger.
De nombreux chercheurs et médecins sont de plus en plus convaincus que beaucoup de décès dus au COVID-19 sont dus à des tempêtes de cytokines.

Un excès d'IL-6 contribue à de dangereuses tempêtes de cytokines, et il existe même un lien direct entre le taux d'IL-6 et la gravité de l'infection virale.

Non seulement ces associations génétiques existent, mais elles sont étayées par des études qui montrent que les niveaux d'IL-6 dans le sang sont en corrélation avec la gravité de la maladie et la probabilité de complications.

Les professionnels de la santé s'accordent désormais sur l'importance de l'IL-6 lors des complications du COVID-19.

C'est pourquoi, si vous avez été séquencé, vous devez vérifier si vous avez les variantes du gène IL-6 qui augmentent ces niveaux et peuvent vous prédisposer à des infections respiratoires plus graves, vous laissant plus vulnérable au COVID-19. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> c'est la même chose si on est asthmatique??? </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> les poumons sont des zones de transfères entre l’atmosphère et le corps humain, quand ils sont fragilisés par les pollutions (urbaines, tabac, etc ...) ils ne jouent plus le rôle de barrière protectrice. C'est en partie pour cela que  les citadins sont plus vulnérables. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Sa touche pas que les poumons aussi les reins et le cerveau </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> bizarre ya aucune photo de ce covid 19 ? </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Si je comprends bien, le covid-19 peut causer des décès par noyade ? </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Huile de Nigel le meilleur remède.. d’ailleurs on en as retrouvé des graines dans la chloroquine tien tien tien... </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> J'ai pas bien compris les explications. Pourquoi il ya de l'eau dans les poumons ? Et comment la réanimation est utile avec un poumon imbibé d'eau ce n'est pas clair ? Merci de votre réponse </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Le remède : vitamine c, piment, oignon, ail, gingembre ...... 🌶️👍👌 </COMMENT 20>

Singapore is calling for people to perform nasal swabs and take blood as it ramps up coronavirus testing amid a jump in infections in the city-state.

No prior health-care experience is needed, it says. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Why is there 51 dislikes? Sigh </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Why are they not covered up - hair and eyes especially. Isn't the virus deadly? </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> I'm surprised the porters/people handling are not using gloves </COMMENT 10>

<COMMENT 16> cna be like exposing every dirt of other asian countries but when it comes to singapore, everything is great,, bruh how'd you expect us to trust all of ur news?? </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Seen some comments like “why the porter did not use gloves?”  Reason is because there’s 2 Nurses who are present during the procedure . Nurse A will go inside , donned on full PPE, bring this biohazard bag —> do swabbing —> put inside that biohazard bag. Nurse B (usually we address them as the circulation nurse) on the other hand will put on the necessary PPE and will stay outside with a red box (the one which the porter will carry). Inside the red box will container a big plastic bag and another biohazard bag. Once nurse A has completed swabbing and placed the swab in a biohazard bag, he/she will open the door and “throw” into the 2nd biohazard bag in the red box without touching anything . Nurse A will close the door. Nurse B (using clean gloves) will seal the biohazard bag number 2 and will tie the plastic bag containing the biohazard bags and specimen. She will then remove his/her gloves , handrub/hand wash and wipe down the red box (although no one touched it) and call the porter to come and send it to the lab. Basically , It’s called double / Triple bagging. Hope this clarifies 😄 </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Thank you for everything... </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> use masks from swissprotect.life and dont worry </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Considering the limited manpower of Singapore, this is already very impressive! South Korea is always ready to provide backup to our Singapore friends. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 8> Lies lies lies. Yeah idiots of course the total number is going up. It can’t go backwards you fucking media morons. Around 1000 people a day are confirmed in the US now. That’s 1000 people out of 330,000,000 and you call this an emergent pandemic??? If you want to fix Cali and New York just let illegal aliens in and deport the democrats! Scum democrats don’t want our economy to come back and the lamestream media doesn’t care either. They’re making a killing off the virus and now protests/riots. Fucking joke. </COMMENT 8>

Look it up. You will find nurses and doctors that have been told to write those as a covid deaths as long as they have it. </COMMENT 13>

<COMMENT 4> Bolsonaro's attitudes are disgusting!
He keeps minimizing the pandemic, ignoring health profesionals and scientists,  and MAKING FUN of the deaths. 
He is a complete idiot as a president. I never thought that we could have any president that could me more dissapointing than Dilma, but he just owned her in this matter. 
He is a huge huge dissapointment. </COMMENT 4>

<COMMENT 9> Don’t criticise the amount of children they have. In such poverty it’s not easy for women to get contraception, or the kind of education system that fairly educates the sexes to believe that they have equal choices. Their society doesn’t empower women to be allowed to choose their own direction. Those are the things that have been proven to lower birth rates all over the world... </COMMENT 9>

<COMMENT 12> This the kind of news you get from the main stream media, the left wing media: only one side of the story. This bias from the media is the same who predicted that BREXIT would be catastrophic, many jobs lost the day after. This is the same media that doesn't believe in the United Kingdom. Why should they believe in Brazil?... who has now the first ever president with no criminal records of corruption? The President knows this virus is going to kill many, but poverty will kill even more there after . Jair Messias Bolsonaro received a broken country in his hands to govern and what he has done in less than two years is more than  the others did in decades. Praying for Brazil, together we will overcome. "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible" Mt 19.26 </COMMENT 12>

<COMMENT 2> Bats suck blood from domestic cattle at night , there is a documentary showing this. Bats even fly into the stables looking for domestic animals. That is the middle carrier. Bats viruses all 100 plus should be identified and tested, and develop prophylactic vaccine. If the virus spreads just identify the viruses and save time on development of vaccine . Out of 100 or so 50% might be benign. It is a matter of when not if that those viruses will jump species. 
The disturbing fact is the military games in Wuhan right before Corona virus explosion. 
All reps from entire world should be screened even monitored at all times.
It could be any country in the world that could have released this bug. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Omg clearly this’s the propaganda document produced by CCP. This doc firmly indicated the virus from wet market. It didn’t mentioned there’s a Coronavirus lab near wet market & it possibly from the lab. It also didn’t mention CCP locked down WUHUNG city but let 5 millions of its citizens travel around the world, spread the virus & infected million millions people died.
Also CCP covered up the virus at the very first stage & didn’t warn  the world also manipulated WHO to tell the world its was not human to human transmission.. there’re a lot a lot more lies </COMMENT 3>

<COMMENT 1> we have nothing else for dengue.  everybody’s obsessed with this  antibodies are supposed to be protective. it turns out that low levels of antibodies cannot neutralize the invading viruses, they  bind to them then they effectively usher them into susceptible cells. in the cells  the viruses  replicate.having had one type of dengue increases your risk of having severe illness if you have a second infection. if you have never had dengue do not get the vaccine.  with this covid antibody level is expected to become less over just one year of time that is the way it seems to work for immunity to these type of viruses. we are going to go there and maybe we will end up just fine. </COMMENT 1>

<COMMENT 3> Thank you Emily toenail......?!!?? </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Have u noticed how his voice doesn't match his lip sync ........?!?!??? </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Thank you....It is all enlightening and I feel even more will be learned...Just like the next major topic= Vaccines....Don’t be me. I am an M.D. but let me tell you what you do not know about vaccines and what I didn’t know and what 90% of all M.D.'s do not know and what No politician knows... I did not know that Vaccines had not been tested against any placebo (ever). 

I did not know that animal testing would be skipped for the future COVID vaccines..I did not know the 30+ ingredients used in vaccines. I did not know that there are neurotoxic aluminum and mercury molecules in vaccines. I did not know enough to research vaccines before vaccinating my own children. 

I did not know that my own precocious, active, talking son would be vaccine-injured. I did not know that my own baby brother (also an M.D.) would become paralyzed (Guillain-Barre) and then die after his swine flu vaccine in the same hospital (Shands) where he had received his medical training. I did not know that my mother(an R.N.) would get 8 vaccines in 1 day to "catch-up" with newly added CDC vaccines to keep her job as Head Nurse in the Largest Hospital in the county and then get such severe, aggressive, progressive brain fog in days and become unable to dial a phone or push an elevator button or remember any of her  5 children in a few weeks and then have this "dementia" progress and then die in diapers.

I did not know that vaccines were given a blanket indemnity from liability in 1986 and now total immunity for all COVID vaccines for the future. I did not know that we gave more vaccines than any other country starting on day #1...I did not know that we have the highest rate of SIDS of the top 35 industrialized countries... I did not know that we had more autism than any other country... I did not know that Vaccines could injure an infant's brain. 

I did not know that vaccines can result in autoimmunity and neurological damage. I did not know that herd immunity does not apply to vaccines and is a myth created by the CDC. I did not know that Vaccines have almost no effect after about four years. 

I did not know how emotional the topic would be and how angry people would be at me for just asking questions about Vaccine Safety. I did not know that pediatricians were paid to give vaccines. I did not know that the CDC owned the Patents on so many vaccines. 
I did not know that the NIH stands to make Billions of dollars on a COVID vaccine. 

I did not know how angry at myself I would be for not knowing. I did not know that the CDC committed fraud and destroyed their evidence in their vaccine safety studies when it showed vaccines can cause autistic neurological changes..I did not know that a whistleblower came forward with all the evidence but he was silenced. I did not know that Merck committed fraud in their vaccine research repeatedly. I did not know that aluminum molecules in the vaccine ingredients is connected to brain inflammation and brain inflammation has been proven to be connected to autism. 
I did not know that vaccines contained human cells from aborted fetuses..

I did not know how much mainstream media would censor the independent research that showed these facts...I did not know that 90% of all vaccine research that the CDC and FDA use to "approve" vaccines are done by the scientists hired by vaccine makers..I did not know if we were alone... I did not know how many other millions of parents and families in the world have been affected by vaccine reactions..I did not know how many would find, join, and share the Facebook help group= Vaccine Support Group on Facebook..I did not know that FB would delete the scientific medical research that had been suppressed, deleted, or censored until it happened to us...  Dr.MAS.. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> The amount of propaganda is the problem! </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> The video pertaining to the Biology and Evolution of Covid 19.Mr.Subramani and the Three Guest have given very good useful resources about the Covid 19 virus. And also what to be expected about the second out break of the corona virus Pandemic. And from my perspective the corona virus has its Advantages and Disadvantages and there so much to learn and gain about this Virus. When someone test positive for the corona virus immune system is low or weak lack of Vitamins A,B,C,D,E,K for strong immune system with healthy eating Habits drinking plenty of water also daily excerise. Hand washing, Social distancing,Wearing Masks. Stay safe everyone Be well. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> I am a BIOLOGIST.    What is with the testing?  Don't  have it today but after the test have it tomorrow.  The virus is in the body of junk eating PEOPLE all over the world. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> boiler-plate molecular virology, milk-toast "nice tree!" tell-nothing phylogenetics, pipe dreaming about molecular-evolutionary constraints.  But the biology of cov19 that truly matters now is the mass action of the epidemic dynamics (mainly the asymptomatics!) and these dynamics' side effects in the form of patients overwhelming hospitals.  Asymptomatics are nuclear to the dynamics but here they show up for 1 microsecond. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> When your teacher makes you watch this for your final  -_- </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> IM STILL WAITING AS TO WHEN TRUMP DUMMY WITH THE TRUMP DUMMY SYNDROME IS GOING TO DECORATE THE SURVIVING PERSONNEL. THAT WAS DEPLOYED ON SECRET MISSION THAT IM SURE WAS PERFECTLY EXECUTED AND THE BRAVERY THAT IT TOOK TO FIRST HANDLE AND FIGHT THE NEW VIRUS? OR AN OLDER NEW ONE AGAIN FOR YOU KNEW WHERE TO GET THE EBOLA VIRUS TO PLAY WITH. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> How ironic is it that none of these big pharma educated, financed, propagandist meat puppets never mentioned how accurate are these RT-PCR test, why Koch postulates have never been used to prove that this particular virus really is the cause of this disease, and why did then inventor of the RT-PCR stated emphatically that this test should not be used in diagnosing infectious disease! I will be patiently waiting for their answers. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> ITS EASY TO DRAW MAPS AND CLAIM THAT YOUR MAP IS CORRECT, BUT THE WARSHIP AT SEA CAUGHT THE VIRUS FROM WHERE? I THINK THEY HAD IT FIRST CAUSE IT WAS THEIR MISSION TO INFECT THE WORLD UNDER TRUMP DUMMY DICTATORSHIP DO WE ALL LOOK THE OTHER WAY, AND PRETEND TO BE UNAWARE.  YOUR MAP THE FIRST LINE,  START WITH THE WARSHIP. THERE WAS EIGHT HUNDRED PLUS INFECTED WHEN COMING TO PORT, THE VIRUS WAS WITH THEM BEFORE THE CRUISE SHIPS GETTING THE VIRUS, ALSO THE SHIP HAD THE FIRST DEATH CASES OF THE AMERICANS THAT WAS NOT DISCLOSED AT THE TIME DUE TO TOP SECRET MISSION. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Hiya to all of you the fantastic Four. As per Elizabeth's comments below. Thankyou. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> This ass hole is so full of shit! Look at his body language he can't help himself </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> I WANT TO SEND A A MESSAGE TO WUHAN, WE KNOW,  WE ARE WATCHING YOU WUHAN P4 LAB. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Nice discussion. Unfortunately, the medical professional has become big business, promoting profit over practice and are now as corrupt as politicians. I remember when I was younger, it seemed the medical profession and especially medical insurance companies were "non-profit".
Now it only matters the bottom line. no more Chickens for a checkup. If they remained non-profit and the government offered grants to offset the greed factor, there could still be innovation among the brightest scholars. The jury is out on the current leaders in the medical profession, everything from competition and theft of patents, to actually illegally involved in the cause for many viruses. Two things are fact. The leading mouthpiece for CV-2 held back a cure for HIV when he could have saved millions of lives, and he also bragged about the effects of HCQ while it was still under patent. We need to fire all the Doctors in suits and bring in good old fashion country doctors whos' first and ONLY responsibility is to their patients. My outlook in life is, if you do good work, you will win praise and wealth. It should not be automatically given to people who make educated guesses for a living, with little to no accountability.
If someone came out with a pill that cured or prevented Cancer, they would be suicided before they reached the patent office. Take the many zero-point energy inventors as a vast example. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Very ideal hosting and presenting 👏🏻 </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Why don’t I know of anyone with it?  When the flue is going around I’ll typically know of about five people at any time with it.
So many lies.  I had a weird cold flue in January like many other people I know.  It lingered.  That was probably the Wuhan virus back then.
It is said that it probably arrived in North America in October.
The economic shutdown is probably a NWO agenda. </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 1> All the stats they found out were actually released by China a long time ago at a very early stage. They said the true death rate is around 2%, they said they were probably many times more cases that were undetected, and some people who died at home were also unaccounted for (Which China got accused of hiding information in that regard, but here we see the US, and every other country also cannot account for all the deaths). The death rate also varied across China with Wuhan being the highest due to the medical system being overwhelmed there. Looks like China was more honest than we thought. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> 1:46 “satistics”? </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> I came with some questions and I’m leaving with some new questions. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Such inaccurate presentation. Very dramatic though. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> In other words....we don't know. K...thanks. 
Having said that. I love Vox. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> the protests are going to cause a huge spike. it could've died out but it's going to rise in young people due to the protests. going to be a sad month June-July. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> fear-monger false numbers  bullshigttt </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Me: So is it deadly or not?
Vox: Yesn't </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> I regret voting for Republicans. They hate and despise poor people while granting millions of dollars to criminal companies. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> excelent coverage, thank you all. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Is it deadly?

Vox: technically no but actually yes </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> 6:01 when will their be an end? </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> and yet people still want to protest. Latest modelling shows an excess 366,000 global deaths and 90,000 in the USA because of lack of adherence to social distancing. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> This didn't resolve the more or less, but maybe whats more important is to not think its over yet. I went out tonight without a mask...but. Maybe not again...for sure.😞 </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> so people with the autoimmune system can't get covid-19? Why don't they become a scientist and help us before it's too late. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> We will never know the death toll.For example,the CDC says the death toll for the H1N1 ranges from 65k-550k deaths! </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> the title is so confusing, it kinda forces you to watch it lol </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> The estimate has been around 1% fatality since early march, so I'm sticking with that. That's about enough that it can exceed all other causes of death combined if it spreads to a large chunk of population quickly. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Ignorance is dangerous than virus.. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> answer: it spreads hella but fatality rate not as much </COMMENT 20>

Welcome to our modern dystopia. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> seriously. This has gone too far. even the devil says it. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Why should the members of the public agree to be traced at all times, it’s going to be privacy infringement 24/7 like that </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> I'll simply give up my phone. I don't turn bluetooth on anyway due to privacy issues. You cant have us store data on our phones. Big time data misuse. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Thank you for keeping us all safe. However, please consider carefully whether a wearing of such a device will be made mandatory. We have to work together to overcome COVID but such a severe invasion in one's privacy comes at a cost to society and I believe that no government or corporate institution should be allowed this amount of power. History has shown us time and time again, that it has a tendency to be misused. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> In a way it’s a blessing in a  disguise that he let us know about this before the elections (we know who to not vote for) </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> 🤔 "Mark of the beast" in early stage liao.. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> I do not agree with a wearable dongle. Even despite a dongle, there will still be a portion of people who will not be captured in the data, for whatever reason.

Contact tracing is not the be all and end all. Perhaps it is better to think out of the box, re-explore and understand the disease again.

Contact tracing is already difficult for a disease like covid 19 that has a varying asymptomatic, untraceable phase, of which this asymptomatic phase is also prone to transmission of the infection. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> I think this government has some neuronal distancing issues. Their brain clusters have been outsourced to the West where thinking gets done for them and then they regurgitate shill policies to us, force-feeding us their human centipede offerings. They are the lowest form of scum on the earth 🙂 </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Hey maybe they should install ERP gantries on all of us. Much easier to collect taxes and fines, as well as make everyone vote for PAP with a little zap ala Milgram obedience experiment </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> another reason for me to migrate </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Thanks PAP ...  great ideas ! i hope you can implement this asap . we need this devices in our streets soon please ... dont need care what other singapore citizen are disagree or oppose lah. just implement it  and make it mandatory... dont worry what other citizen are saying .  dont need care them lah...   what the PAP or government have say or decided ,  they loser citizen can only kpkb online and have to accept it anyway .. and you guys PAP can still continue to get your highly weekly or high monthly salary...  let implement it . Support PAP forever !!! i been a loyal supporter of PAP for many years... thanks you PAP and CCP . you guys are excellent and good leaders .. but can we implement it before the elections :) </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> VOTE THESE DOGS OUT </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> It is not compulsory for now, only ELECTION  is compulsory. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> This is actually more concerning than the virus itself. Many are in disagreement cos their conscience know that this isn't right. We aren't gonna put on this demonic tag and feel like a prisoner in our own country. People wouldn't wanna visit this supposedly safe nation anymore. Where are our rights as citizens? The beginning of the end if this is to be made compulsory in the near future. To add, they look haggard cos of the evil they know of as they read the orders from their "big bosses"... </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Why these tracing when all these Covid- 19 is from all the Doms. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> I think it’s no more a Democracy just likes China Communist Party Governments.

When will the Microchips be Implemented in Singapore.

Where is the Freedom. Of the People of Singapore. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> This device is not useful in reducing infection rate and costly. Do not allow the PAP government to proceed with this bad policy. I am urging all Singaporeans to write in to your MPs and pressure them to stop this measure. If they refuse, do not vote for the PAP.
In the event you are issued one, wrap it with aluminium foil to prevent the device from spying on you. </COMMENT 18>

<COMMENT 2> Seems like political lockdown seems like all the data was messed up from death rates to masks this is stupid as hell so angry that we ruined everything over lies. And when we think about how many people died when some meds could've helped damn shame </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Don't bother reading the comment section, just watch the video and leave on the high note. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Can we speculate about the motive? Money, political (Trump derangement syndrome)? </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> There is fake news. Now there is faked research. 

What are the consequences for Lancet and the fraudulent researchers? Do they just get away? </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Wow!!  I hope they pursue an investigation on these so-called "experts" and charge them with mass-murder should it be proven that they published erroneous information deliberately. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Never let unelected “experts” make policy decisions, especially those which concern individuals healthcare. My goodness the JP Morgan research, which is very good, is the best I have seen on this whole boondoggle. Even found that the harsher more draconian lockdowns did not work. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Beware also a very recent paper whose authors are mostly from Uni of Minnesota </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Australian hospital denied even being contacted </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> WHO is trash. Lancet is trash, NEJM is trash. No credibility. Surgisphere is a con job. They are fraud. But they exposed Lancet and how little (or no diligence) they do. They are hot trash. I knew this was bogus when I read the “study” when it came out.  It was full of red flags. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Follow the money and it'll lead directly to Remdesivir. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> This ,on top of many other recent examples of corrupt research and jaded corrupt researchers makes makes trusting so called peer reviewed journals risky  for practitioners in the field . Harvard should terminate everyone associated with this research and Desai should be held accountable . This was a crime against humanity ! </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> So maybe the virus was man made after all?
https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidnikel/2020/06/07/norway-scientist-claims-report-proves-coronavirus-was-lab-made/ </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> If this can happen when every body on earth watching, imagine how many shady studies got passed before.  Coming from an engineering background, I am horrified by the poor logic and math ability of the medical community.  You are the only exception I have came across. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> ha ha liar liar pants of fire </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Question, when antiviral/antibody drugs will be used early in disease so we can start to have it in some control or move down the risk of severe complications to those similar in % to influenza? Antivirals should defintely be used as early as possible but no one seems to do so right now even if current drugs used safety is already known for years. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Dr. Seheult: I really wish that you would do a video examining the connection between ACE-inhibitor side effects and COVID-19 symptoms, which, from what I understand, are the same, and are from the same mechanism in the body-a build-up of bradykinin which causes angioedema. Yet, once in the hospital, doctors have been advised to keep giving these medications to their COVID-19 patients, even though these side effects can be fatal, and they don't stop unless the drug is discontinued! I have summarized what I have found on this subject in a video/powerpoint. I believe this is a very critical issue and really needs more attention. This is the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xLo8qpX3gE </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Comment on the rct study finding non prophylactic benefit to hcq and the uk rct study finding no therapeutic benefit to hcq, for your live stream </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Fake science with an outcome that certain people like, for political reasons, and trumpeted all over. Moral turpitude kills, not merely someone who gets arrested, but the unborn.  I believe the current fatality rate for children in the womb is about one in three or so, quite the pandemic there, and the cause is known and curable: moral turpitude.  This video is merely  and example of the tentacles of such things.  First they poisoned the cats and dogs with tainted food, next they poisoned meds with tainted ingredients, then, the same people gave us the virus, letting people leave the infected province for the US, but not other Chinese provinces, all while saying things were okay.  Now, they sell us masks - really! Moral corruption is a bigger pandemic than the virus, because it kills more people. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Thank you, Dr. Seheult. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 7> If we have to take it every year so be it. As long as the immunity lasts do at least a year. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> You guys still listen to fauci. Oh my bad new world oder and u are a part of it </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Wake-up, people. The planet and our country have been shut down by hysteria and fear. Masks, social distancing, and contact-tracing are all SNAKE OILS being sold to us. Don't buy into it. It is silly to be walking around wearing a mask and praying for a vaccine when we already have a cure. HCQ and CDS (MMS). HCQ is cheap, effective and has been in use for 70+ years. Big pharma and the medical mafia can't make a dime on it so it must be shown to be "scary" so they can push the new expensive, patented, and exclusive drug and vaccines that will certainly have more risks. People, look at the fine print on all of the medications you take right now before you talk about the risks of taking HCQ as a preventative or cure. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Ah the real Agenda revealed. GTFOH. Not taking it. We have immunity its called the immune system. Bolster it with Vitamin D3, C, Zinc and generally taking care of your body. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Is there anyone who still takes this fake virus seriously.   Everyone I know,  knows this is a joke. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> is the vaccine already made??? </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> People are waking up. Just stop already. No mention of 2017/18 flu season having more deaths. Was the world shut then? </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> This is how pharmaceutical companies makes their money. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Everyone understand this is all about money, control and power? </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> I dispute the notes: 
Coronavirus was "discovered" in 1963 ~ year with which I have much familiarity; Fauci is right about the Quinine thing as that is for Malaria and in the hands of a licensed trained person may have compassionate use benefits off-label which are correct for an individual person yet Zinc adjuvant Quercetin  is readily available despite  valid rebuttals - this oddly has a G-String ( lewd connotation intended ) which has no precedence prior to genomic tampering consequent to tools that never existed before; </COMMENT 16>

<COMMENT 20> Haven't I seen this episode about New Blood? Glad it will replace True Blood. How often will I have to take it and what is the annual cost? Glad they reengineered it so its effectiveness is for such a short amount of time. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 8> World wide set-up. Testing done on people for years. But the blood of those who pass from this virus will be on their hands. Let me ask you a question since this virus is airborne for a short time will wearing a mask prevent it from entering through the eyes? </COMMENT 8>

<COMMENT 10> That vacine needs to start now so that the virus can be gone and go away </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Ppl. please do your part to make sure they do not rush out this particular vaccine.  This will be the first vaccine to use nanotechnology and synthetic mRNA.  All the other vaccines use an inactivated virus from a living source.  Even Bill Gates said thousands could have serious side effects or death from the coming COVID vaccine.  I have been writing to the government to please not "warp speed" this vaccine.  They have to get it right! </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Because of covid-19 a lot of people with knowledge  in the field of vaccine  preparation have did a good job.Whether covid-19 will have a vaccine? What is the possibility of a vaccine for covid-19? What is its  potentiality? Is the actual remedy to save life is the production of a vaccine for covid-19? Why all the  vaccines so far  produced for covid-19  by the so called experts were failed?  Is there no other remedies? There are a lot of questions never answered. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Hi friends.  Just prayed for our healthcare workers & those suffering.  God bless them.  Like many, I'm home, staying safe.  I'm a senior with, unfortunately, major medical issues.

I do wish everyone the best & hope this crisis ends ASAP.  Stay safe & help out your neighbor.  WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER. </COMMENT 13>

<COMMENT 2> We don't need scientists to figure masks work. EVERY country that has controlled the virus require masks when indoors / busses / subways, etc. The IDIOT countries that do not require (or SUPER IDIOT countries like the USA that is against masks) have poor outcomes with many deaths and have lead to closing the economies down. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> The pandamic"safety" measures(like social distancing, face masks, gloves, self-quarantine, etc) have NOT made people safe at all, at all. It just made people to be more racist & hateful to each other. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Speaking of Reactive Oxygen Species, I saw this article on how lack of sleep kills Fruit flies: https://www.quantamagazine.org/why-sleep-deprivation-kills-20200604/?utm_source=pocket-newtab  It may be just an interesting study, but small things can cause big things. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Could you use antibodies from recovered patients to inoculate at risk people? If so, what's the hold up? </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Great, keep it up </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> The controversies are all for politic reasons... Fake studies just keep coming out because of politics. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> In the way back machine When people started speculating that they could buy masks at a low price and sell them back later, that is a sign that the market is anticipating that they would be of some Marginal benefit. The alphabet soup organizations  lost all legitimacy when they came to confiscate people who took these precautions and market actions. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> the main risk of mechanical ventilation is an infection, as the artificial airway (breathing tube) may allow germs to enter the lung. This risk of infection increases the longer mechanical ventilation is needed and is highest around two weeks. Another risk is lung damage caused by either over inflation or repetitive opening and collapsing of the small air sacs Ialveoli) of the lungs </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Please answer this question..are parents being irresponsible not putting masks on infants and small children esp. at places like walmart...I think ...please give me your opinion and knowlegde.. luv your channel!! </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Use mask... or learn how to not spit when you talk? </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> I do not have high expectations for organizations like WHO, whatever mistakes made by them, although dissapointing, is not surprising. I can not say the same thing about what happened with Lancet and NJM. In times of a sanitary pandemic I place part of my faith and trust in science, not religión or mankind. That's why what happened with HCQ studies is unacceptable. But life must go and science must repair the damage done by other men. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> i love all your videos and from the bottom of my heart thank you for doing them.  the only problem i have, and have ever had with any of your videos is this part right here.  the way he says "healthy" is different when wearing a mask, and not wearing a mask.  i still believe we should be wearing masks yes.  but i dont think he had to exaggerate during the demonstration.  a real pity and shame. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> White people are extroverts, they can't spend time alone and need some freedoms. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Amazing stuff here, thanks for the video!! </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> You should always be wearing a mask when dealing with patients or people 😒 </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Looks like the WHO has been using an experimental drug and it is called "RIOTS" to cure covid19 </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Please please please  you  have the attention of so many healthcare professionals....please keep an open mind to treatments that perhaps are not the established standard western  protocol as we need to remain humble and open minded . Likewise, we must critically examine the standards we now have and remain open to the possibility that they may not be what we have been taught  to believe—to the point of breaking down our beliefs down to the very fundamentals we were taught. It’s painful but necessary to look at the narrative and motives of all these things so that we remain true to that oath Primum non nocere. ***Conscious discernment not indoctrination.*** </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Blackstrap Molasses For covid hematology?
Potential Impact of Blackstrap Molasses on COVID-19 symptoms ?
Blackstrap Molasses is rich in iron which should affect heme molecule binding </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Absolutely love your content, it is my go-to source for updates. Will be donating after my next paycheck. I will say though that I will not personally be even remotely considering a vaccine for another 5 years. It is void of logic to me to witness how vigilant almost every country has taken measures to insure that as little people as possible get exposed or infected. Only then to suggest we infect and expose a lot of people. Not a fan of pathogenic priming. Not a fan of rushed vaccines. Mainly, not a fan of the very corrupt history of vaccine safety data manipulation. I'm gonna pass and go for keeping my immune system strong. 🙏 Love the work though and the vaccine trial resource is great. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 2> It's been a while since I've been to the college o medical knowledge (UAB '83), but this is very well presented. I've taken and recommended NAC for years. Go for purity, and if you buy in bulk, measure dosages accurately. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> These videos are a great direct analysis (even for non-medical students) of what's going on without going through the editorial and filtration process of major media.  Please keep these coming. </COMMENT 3>

<COMMENT 5> NAC has also been shown to aid in stopping drug habits including cigarettes.  It's a win win in every facet. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> EASY WAY TO GET RID OF HIV WITHIN 12 DAYS DAYS 

i want to use this opportunity to testify on  how i got cured from HIV,  HIV is known not to have a cure, i have this virus since 2010, i have done all my best to get cured from this disease but non could avail until a friend of mine told me about doctor oosa herbal home on the internet who helps people cure any type of diseases including HIV AIDS, cancer, Herpes etc, at first i doubt  if it was real but decided to give it a try, when i contacted Dr OOSA he helped me with his herbal medicine which i used and i got cured within 2 weeks.i went for a medical checkup and my doctor confirmed it that i am negative  HIV. the main reason why i share this testimony is to tell the whole world that HIV is real and the cure is also real.if you have HIV and you lost your hope doctor oosa is the right herbal doctor to contact. Contact this great herbal doctor for any kind of disease or ailment via this email doctoroosaherbalhome@gmail.com  whatsapp +359878394269 </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Guess what might be effective against a 🦇 virus? 🧄&🧅 (🧛‍♂️😉😁)  🧄&🧅 are great sources for sulphor, will induce glutathione production (as NAC does), are antiviral and blood-thinning, and if you eat too much, 🧄&🧅 will have the same side effects as NAC (🤮). Raw 🧅 are a good quercetin source, and 🧅 quercetin has a better bioavailability than quercetin from supplements (later only about 1%). Therefore, 1/2 a raw 🧅/day + zinc might be a cheap 2-in-1 way for COVID-19 prophylaxis. Add ginger, black pepper and tumeric as further antioxidants. If you are drinking and/or smoking, or take other poison, glutathione in the liver will be used for detox. </COMMENT 7>

Stay healthy with a strong immune system so the body can be the miracle it's meant to be!!!  Stay healthy out there. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> NAC is also freaking cheap </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Thanks once again. I've come back to this video to re learn the studies on NAC. It took weeks to find a sorce of NAC. When it was delivered I had forgotten most of the data. I am now taking 500mg per. day, just as a prophylactic. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> I can’t tell you how much I respect your brilliant analysis, your clarity, your intense focus on understanding covid’s mechanisms in the body, and your devotion to saving the lives of people you will never even meet. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> NAC was the first thing i thought of. It helped me to achieve remission from severe depression/anxiety and i generally react well to antioxidants, when it comes to my mood issues and chronic pain. Thus, when i heard of cytokine storm... But i am only a layman. 🤷 </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Excellent teaching. Have added/embedded this video at www.NACinCOVID.info (www.NACinCOVID.net). We're setting up a clinical trial using NAC in COVID at Cambridge Health Alliance (@challiance). @BostonTox @mlaib </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Hi Roger, check this paper out, maybe: 2019 Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19): Paving the Road for Rapid Detection and Point-of-Care Diagnostics. https://www.mdpi.com/2072-666X/11/3/306 </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> What would happen if i took glutathione and NAC together at the same time? </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> My favorite doctor </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> I came across this interesting article summarizing a number of studies on both oxidative stress, but also the use of NAC supplementation to address psychiatric issues- bipolar, obsessive compulsive, substance abuse. See here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3036554/ </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> I'M 78,BUT I HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH THAT I HAD AMOST FORGOTTEN FROM MY PAST EDUCATION.YOU'RE THE BEST ILLUSTRATOR FOR THIS SUBJECT AND I WATCH ONLY YOUR VIDEOS.I ALSO ADMIRE YOUR SPIRITUAL COMMITMENTS AND I FELT LIKE THE 1st TIME I LISTENED I KNEW THAT YOU WERE HONEST,DEDICATED,AND A PROMOTER OF TRUTH.I WILL CONTINUE TO BE A BELIEVER IN YOUR PROTOCOL.I'M A VERY HIGH RISK HAVING HAD SEPIS 3 TIMES AND PNEUMONIA 3 TIMES;ONCE BI-LATERAL.GOD BE BLESSED FOR MY SURVIVAL.YOU ARE MY MEDICAL HERO ~KEEP UP THE WONDERFUL WORK ! </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Can I safely ake NAC like Vitamin D on daily basis?, and is it ok to take if Iam taking a daily dose of aspirin 82 mg? </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Thank you doc, I’m 65 years old, and I take NAC,Vitamin D3,Vitamin C and Zinc everyday. And I eat as healthy as possible gets lots of exercise and plenty of sunlight and fresh air.And I’ve tried to share this information with my family and friends, but they look at me like I’m crazy and say stuff like you’re not a doctor.. and if that’s true why don’t they mention it on the news or the medical industry haven’t approved it... yet they are all getting sick by not listening... I will try to share this link of your studies with them , maybe they would listen to you.... but I want to thank you so much for this information.... you are a blessing to us all❤️👍💯. </COMMENT 20>

The people and government did their best to deal with covid, we have thousands of voluntary medical student willing to help doctors, we are now able to create our own ventilators, built new covid hospitals with (2.000),converting wisma atlit to emergency covid. Check the real news that is free from hiddlen agenda like this one and check a fair comparison to other countries https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ </COMMENT 3>

<COMMENT 16> The government has already lifted the social restrictions in Bandung, i believe Indonesia is not well prepared for 'new normal,' even Korea, which has better healthcare facilities than Indonesia, failed. I honestly fear that the second wave will come and wipe half of Indonesia's population. 

In my opinion, human lives are more important than economy, so please prolong the restrictions. It's for the best to all of us. </COMMENT 16>

Never give up..
We will win together..

<COMMENT 20> And then, we motherf opening with "new normal". We in the beginning are in denial, local government (provincial of jakarta) are speaking loudly, the central government even ridicule the provincial government. According to Bloomberg, approx 3 times the death rate from official figure. I'm ashamed for the government, and more ignorant is the government raising the medical insurance in the middle of the pandemic.  Our medical worker even kinda gave up with #indonesiaterserah . our central government are kinda stupid, they defy epidemiologist, if they act faster it would be more easier to handle. The one whom gave more information are the local government, all the central government do only more slogan and raising expenses. Just wait, another Ecuador are gonna happen. </COMMENT 20>

Thease may be important factors in the determination of causes behind the statistics.

<COMMENT 1> COVID-19 had turned out to be THE world's most effective Weapon of Mass Destruction (WMD) </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> You don't have to debunk this theories, because the newest one is viruses doesn't exist,ore at least are not harmful. So awakened people can take this new theory, and get rid of all the others </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Well protesters all over the world takin to the streets so if there's not a large spike of infection in the next few weeks like we have been told would happen if we left our house  then I would assume it's all been lies </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Ok how about debunking the huge room of people in the HOR or what not telling someone they can take off their mask as everyone in the room was already immunized to covid19. People say it was a joke but no one in the clip laughed about it and he had no change in voice tone and when i went to hear it again google had removed all the videos including it </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> I believe Covid-19 was created in a laboratory in "The Wuhan Institute of Virology" by the Chinese Government, to stop the Hong Kong riots and protests, in which it did, and it then got completely out of hand around the world.! 
Funny that there is no riots in Hong Kong now, and China has implemented Chinese rule on Hong Kong during the lockdown, and Covid-19 is starting to disappear now.
Over 400k dead world wide, the Chinese Government don't care, that's nothing to them, they couldn't exactly send the Chinese troops in to Hong Kong to stop the riots and protests.! so they created a virus instead, its easy done, as we can all see. 
Just my opinion.! </COMMENT 5>

<COMMENT 10> Prof Dave, have you looked at the claims of James Lyons-Weiler PhD? </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> i thot you gonna talk about Bill Gates vaccine , 666 chips, etc. this is the number one most popular HOAX in the world. not just in the US </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Professor Dave, this is a serious question, how do we know we’re safe?
The latest WHO numbers have the known cases to know deaths now below 1% (.6% last I saw) and that should go even lower as more cases are discovered.
When this 1st began and it was at 3%, they speculated it could be below 1%, but just in case, we need to quarantine in case the fatality rate really is 3%.
The CDC numbers have fatalities plummeting the last few weeks, since many places have begun opening back up again(which have included large groups gathering, within 6 feet of each other on beaches, without masks, probably transmitting things not called COVID-19).
So the fall in numbers aren’t correlated to beginning a quarantine.

Every piece of media I see, still seems to be fear mongering.
It’s “a new normal”.
It’s “there could be a 2nd wave”.
It’s “no one can ever gather in groups, within 6 feet of each other, ever again”
It’s “we have to play sporting events without fans” (never mind the large numbers of protesters gathered together)
It’s “we can’t have students attending actual classes or living in dorms”

I’ve even heard major new sources suggest “CDC numbers are too low & fraudulent”
That sounds like conspiratorial thinking?
We may never have a COVID-19 vaccination.
If we have one, there’s always another pandemic around the corner and we’ve always managed in the past to get through it with less knowledge and without destroying our way of life.

At what point do we just go back to not living in fear and isolation?
The “experts” I hear in the media sound like they want everyone to live in fear and isolation for the foreseeable future.
People are losing jobs, and having tons of people in homeless shelters, will probably spread the disease faster than being at work 8 hours a day.

Do we still think millions will die, if people stop the quarantine tomorrow and get back to living life?
I don’t think the data bears that out.

Who will tell us we’re safe?
How will they know?
There is risk to everything, what is the acceptable level, & can someone tell me what exactly that is.
If we thought about the 1.35 million people who die on roads every year, would we want to drive?
I want the legitimate truth, does anyone have a clue? </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> https://drive.google.com/file/d/19CbWmdGTnnW1iZ9pxlxq1ssAdYl3Eur3/view  

I found this is two seconds.   Several studies, peer reviewed that show clear and present danger.   Some countries do not allow wifi in schools and it's not because they are uninformed. 

Don't be fooled by this guy, there are A LOT of scientists concerned about the level of radiation we are exposing ourselves to.    Here's a excerpt from Scientific American:

"The World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified RFR as "possibly carcinogenic to humans" in 2011. Last year, a $30 million study conducted by the U.S. National Toxicology Program (NTP) found “clear evidence” that two years of exposure to cell phone RFR increased cancer in male rats and damaged DNA in rats and mice of both sexes. The Ramazzini Institute in Italy replicated the key finding of the NTP using a different carrier frequency and much weaker exposure to cell phone radiation over the life of the rats." 

  And that's just cell phones.  Imagine what a tower pulsing crazy numbers is doing.   I'm not saying it's the cause of Coronoa, not at all,  but there is for sure evidence that it might be harmful.  And this guy is wrong about 5G not being new...it's been around but not networked nationwide, which is what they've been turning on the past couple years.  He sounds like he's reading PR from Verizon's website or something.

Go ahead and click and read the some of the 200 stuidies I linked to and get back to me if you aren't seeing a pattern of potential risk to humans.    This guy just dropped in credibility a lot for me. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> do you have keyboards on the keyboard? </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Conspiracy followers are quite likely to write-off any contradictory evidence, by claiming that the contradictory evidence is part of the conspiracy.  Indeed, people have genuinely written-off all evidence that contradicts the notion that COVID 19 is a conspiracy, by calling that contradictory evidence a conspiracy.  Covering all bases, the conspiracy people have declared COVID 19 to be a conspiracy because it does exist, or a conspiracy because it doesn't exist.  In other words, the virus was created by the Illuminati/NWO/Bill Gates/1984 Big Brother/Chinese/US Government/Spherical Earth scientists, in order to control all of humanity, at the same time as being a hoax by the Illuminati/NWO/Bill Gates/1984 Big Brother/Chinese/US Government/Spherical Earth scientists. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> While I was awaiting your reply I did some research of my own and it turns out my immune system will take care of the virus in a few days just like the thousands of people who had it and survived.. So why exactly should one imprison ones self when  the symptoms are mild and the cure inside us all..hmmm? </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Typhoid Mary had an excuse, these idiots today don't have one, and I mean stupid people who refuse to wear masks to prevent the spread. Asymptomatic individuals who have no symptoms but are carriers. I wear a kiosk respirator to protect me and my elderly parents from these people. The next extinction event will be caused by stupidity not a natural disaster, not to say that stupidity is'nt a natural disaster. It is. Ignorance is excusable, stupidity is not. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Interesting. Take a bunch of insane and stupid conspiracy theories like the viruses don’t exist and 5G nonsense and combine them with the investigation of the origin which raises super legit questions. Is it to discredit the very legitimate argument on the origin? </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> I don’t know about you, but I’m a ginger and I destroyed COVID (probably, I was sick for a while at the start of the Corona craze and I felt like I was going to die.) </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> All but the fourth are insane junk of course. But on the 4th, not buying it. First, people cannot manufacture viruses. Let’s get that out of the way. Nobody is saying that.  What we are saying is that there is very high likelihood that this came form the virology lab in Wuhan (which is run by the PLA by the way). The most innocuous explanation is an accident. Accidental release of a virus they were researching. However, another scenario is they were conducting biological weapons research and experimenting with viruses that can attach to humans easily. Again accidental release. I give that a lower probability and a Nature article makes a plausible and convincing case against it.  But leaves several questions. The spike S protein is perfectly adapted to a human host. In fact, based on other research from Australia, this S glycoprotein binds to humans better than it binds in any other animal host. That part is very odd and such mutation in an intermediate animal host seems hard to believe. On the other hand, developing these mutations while in human hosts means that it had to be circulating for a while in humans (well before November and remember this is a slow mutating virus) but there is no evidence of that. This is very odd. Why I think lab experimentation (creation of Chimera viruses) is at least a plausible explanation. Perhaps a low probability but is plausible. This kind of research is nothing new, the Soviets used to conduct such experiments. At some point they tried to combine the DNA from Venezuelan equine encephalitis, smallpox (super contagious) and Ebola viruses (back in the 80’s). It was called the Chimera Project. The Chinese want to dominate the world and show their scientific excellence. 

Bottomline, don’t listen to what the Chinese say. Pay attention to what they do. The mad cover up and the lies. Why would they go to such extend to cover up if it was from an animal market? Also, if it was truly from the wet animal market why would they open them back up so fast? Makes little sense. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 9> <COVID-19 TRUTH>
*Most people won’t get the virus.*
*Most of the people who get it won’t display symptoms.*
*Most of the people who display symptoms will only be mildly sick.*
*Most of the people with severe symptoms will never be critically ill.*
*And most of the people who get critically ill will survive.*

This is borne out by the numerous serological studies which show, again and again, that the infection fatality ratio is on par with flu.
( https://swprs.org/studies-on-covid-19-lethality/ )
There is no science – and increasingly little rational discussion – to justify the lockdown measures and overall sense of global panic.
Nevertheless, it’s always good to get official acknowledgement of the truth, even if it has to be leaked.
Here are three leaks showing that those in power know that the coronavirus poses no threat, and in no way justifies the lockdown that is going to destroy the livelihoods of so many.
1. “IT’S ALL BULLSHIT!”
On May 26th Dr Alexander Myasnikov, Russia’s head of coronavirus information, gave an interview to former-Presidential candidate Ksenia Sobchak in which he apparently let slip his true feelings.
( https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/05/27/its-all-bullsht-russias-coronavirus-information-chief-says-of-virus-fears-a70398 )
Believing the interview over, and the camera turned off, Myasnikov said:
It’s all bullshit […] It’s all exaggerated. It’s an acute respiratory disease with minimal mortality […] Why has the whole world been destroyed? That I don’t know,”

<COMMENT 14> Amazing news </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> PABALA
Panunuhol ay umiiral na ngaun sa mga companies at sa Media para ma isagawa na ang pang kalahatan bakuna.

May dalawang component itong future vaccine na hnd pa tinutukoy secret pa. Pero ang pangatlo ay ang " SQUALENE ".

COVID 19 =means Certificate Of Vaccination Identity with 19, 1=A 9=I for AI= Artificial Intelligence

Hindi pala ito pangalan ng virus, kung hindi itoy International plan para ma control at hnd dumami o lumaki ang population. At na developed na ito mga 10 year o mahigit pa. Na ilunsad na ito last January 2020 during the last DAVOS.
DONT GET TRACK
(wag tau sumunod)
pag katapos ng 70 days, ang virus na ito ay hnd na active, kaya nalalampasan natin ito. Kaya naman nag reactivates ang virus na ito, kasi humina ang immune natin sa bakuna.
Ang plano talaga nila i inject sa atin (7 more terrible vaccines) totoong ibabana o ihuhulog tayo pa puntang impierno.

Ang target nila, madaming mababawas na tao, mahigit 80% ang ma papasama.

Ito naman 5G na na install sa mga cities sa buong mundo, ay para sa ganun humina ang atin immune defense. Kaya wag talaga mag pa test hindi ito segurado o ligtas.

Ang mga manufacturer o gumagawa ng test na ito ay nag sasabi, na hnd ma detect ang SRaS_COV_2 virus na ito. Kung hindi ang walang katapusan na maliliit ma virus o wastes cell lamang na nasa microbiata natin, kaya ang result o lumalabas, madami ang positibo pero hnd nila matukoy ang covid virus mismo.

Kaya ito ang objective nila:
Ang reason ngaun, una ilabas ang mga bata, kasi hnd nila ma impose ang test sa mga matatanda.

Sa kabila nito, last May 11 sa France, nag karoon ng mass screening da lahat ng school(700thousand/per week).
Kaya naman bawat School Director ay may pahintulot galing sa Rectorate para sa ganun  ma impose o ma obliga ang test sa mga bata. Kahit walang pahintulot sa magulang o wala manlang pasabi.

Once na ang bata na screened, saka lang tatawagin ang immediate family para mag pa screened test din. Obligado ka tanggapin ang screening. Kasi kung ayaw mo, an anak mo ay aalisin o tatanggalin sa naturang school. Yan ang mangyayari at itoy ay Order ng School.

Tayo walang sakit, tayo ay healthy carriers, carriers lang tayo sa maliliit o little viruses lamamg yan ang laging lumalabas sa mga test....as positive.
Lahat sila kailangan ganito:
Paniwalain na ang buong mundo. Na ang mundo natin ay may sakit. " MAKE THE WHOLE WORLD BELIEVE THAT THE WORLD IS SICK".

Kapag naging positive sa test ay matutukoy na isa kang panganib, tulad ng mga Hudyo.
Ang pag tanggi sa screening ay siyang susi para mas maiwasan natin ang pag tatalaga ng bakuna sa atin (wave 2), kapag hindi tumaas ang bilang, ay mas hindi sila papayagan na italaga ang bakuna sa 7 bilyon katao....

Sa oras na nabakunahan  labat tayo ay magkakasaki at manghihina.....at alam nyo ma ang kasunod...
Sa France, ang mga tao doon ay tumatanggi sa screening, at ang dahilan, the only messege is maintindihan ito ng buong Social Network and in France is the ff:
_during 9 days we shld only talk about that,
_close your book, videos that deal with secondary subjects.

At ang last messege to get across during those 9 days.
_ huwag sumunod, at wag payagan ang mga bata sumunod na walang pahintulot ng magulang.

Sa France, ang mensahe ay na iintindihan ng mga mamamayan doon, na hnd nila pababalikin ang mga bata sa School. Pagitan ng mga estado, na may mga critical situation. Ayaw nila may mass screened at hnd sila obligado sa second wave to be vaccinated o bakunahan. Ang mahalagang solution, iligtas ang isang katauhan and to make people understand that they should not be tested.
Huwag mag pa test
Huwag ibigay sa kanila kung ano ang wala sila
Huwag kang mahulog sa trap.
Everything will flow from there;
1. Hindi ka mag papahuli
2. Hindi ka mag papa test
3. Hindi ka mag papa bakuna

We must fill the walls of face book, videos, all media spaces with this unique messege.

More clear panels!
Their point of attacks; our children.
Str

Their strategy:
_ a screening
_ do not give what they lack
_ at least you cannot say that you have not been warned

Ipa mahagi ito sa lahat hangat maaari sa lalong madaling panahon, hangat maaari kasi ang proseso nitoy ay parating na.

oh my God Hide us in your pavillion, save us Lord.

<COMMENT 17> Most of us have already been exposed and probably have not just antigens but t cells from previous coronaviruses we've fought off.  Vitamin C, D and zinc and good nutrition will fight off covid.  I know this first hand because I have family at the front line working in health directly with covid patients on a daily basis and they have never caught covid when other colleagues have.  The only difference was my family mega dosed with Vit C, D and zinc.  It works and could have stopped this virus from getting out of hand if only more doctors implemented this as a treatment.  High dose IV vit C was used in China and all people in the trial recovered.  Even those who were declining quickly.  Also they couldn't find a vaccine for Sars 1, the ferrets they used all produced cytokine storms when exposed to the live virus.  Moderna's current human trials have already produced serious effects in the test subjects.  One guy passed out, had a high fever and was vomiting and he was young and healthy.  Now imagine giving that to your elderly grandparents, would be disasterous.  Do your own research.  When Moderna shares spike by 40% with the "promising" results from the trials this far why would the Chief Medical Officer sell off ALL of his shares unless he knows something we don't.  If you had shares in Apple or Facebook and your company went up by 40% overnight, you would sell some and keep some shares, not sell 100% of them.  These are the things we need to look out for.  Find out for yourselves.  Don't just take the vaccine for the sake of it.  Most people are asymptomatic because of the t cells they already have ready to go.  You are the solution to this problem.  Trust your immune systems, they are brilliant and no vaccine can ever replace that. </COMMENT 17>

<COMMENT 3> o2 saturation less than 95% is not normal. 96-98% is NORMAL. 98% is ideal. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Lots of out dated and just plain incorrect information here </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> This is  totally untrue. Everyone should go get covid 19 tested first before you watch these videos with so much misinformation going around. When you test negative for coronavirus,  you can rest assured that there is nothing to spread. You can't spread something that is non-existent in your body. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Thank you very very much! God Bless You always🙏 </COMMENT 6>

<COMMENT 17> Highly appreciated and informative Dr Christy. I think people and the medical fraternity needs to get this message of yours to the whole world. Back here in India,it's like a great panic and business. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Who sent her??? People who don't exhibit the normal symptoms can still spread the virus and therefore should get tested. Getting ahead of the virus means testing for everyone, not just people with pre-existing conditions. Sounds l Iike a set-up👀 </COMMENT 18>

<COMMENT 12> I've been under lockdown for two months because there was a "deadly virus" and now with thousands protesting in the streets, all of the sudden COVID-19 desapears.  What a fu cking joke! </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> What do masks prevent in public?

Why does the General Public need to wear Masks???

Masks sicken the 90% of people with or acquiring covid-19 immunity who onlx experience 0-Mild symptoms on the way to immunity.

Those with worse symtoms should stay home until symptoms disappear like with the FLU as covod-19 is less than Flu in severity.

Those with harsher symptoms seek appropriate MEDICAL attention.

New York did not change ventilator treatment killing most victims on ventilators...including 80% Blacks?

New York indescriminately refused to provide crucial treatment for non covid-19 patients...sending them home to suffer/die?

Illegal certification of covid-19 Deaths.

Resident's of Nursing Homes were killed from covid infected patients being admitted before healing or HERD IMMUNITY.

Virus spread is required for safe HERD IMMUNITY! </COMMENT 13>

<COMMENT 7> Hello, sir.

Let me introduce myself, I'm Ferry, from Bogor, Indonesia.

Just sharing info. That in Indonesia, our small team, named Milagros, has given milagros water donations to hospitals that treat positive patients.

And the result, just by drinking Milagros water, recovery from covid19, is very perfect.

In our data, it has been noted that Milagros water is able to fight covid19. Also other health problems.

What I'm focusing on is that in Indonesia there is no need for a vaccine. We just take Milagros, corona can be overcome.

Right now, what your country does not have, but in my country is very abundant, is Milagros water.

Which is clearly proven to be able to cure positive patients covid19 to completion.

And it's proven, some of our small teams don't need an anti-covid vaccine. Just drinking milagros, it's resolved.

If you want to know more about Milagros water, you can contact my Whatsapp number at +6285925081694 </COMMENT 7>

<COMMENT 15> “Illnesses range from mild to severe and even death. Hospitalization and death occur mainly among high risk groups. Worldwide, these annual epidemics are estimated to result in about 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness, and about 290 000 to 650 000 respiratory deaths”. This paragraph was taken straight from a WHO site. Anyone reading it might imagine it refers to Covid-19 but no, it refers to the average worldwide annual influenza infections. The figures of up to 5 million infections and 650,000 deaths means a death rate of up to 13% of those infected. As I write this, Covid-19 has infected 5,933,622 people and 362,629 have died, representing a death rate of those infected of approx. 6.1%. So far, the death rate for Covid-19 is approximately half that of influenza.

<COMMENT 6> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blJVePv_E_E </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> I REALLY NEED TO KNOW if there is a relapse of infection (not reinfection) was is the risk of contaigon? If I've been feeling fine for better for two weeks but still test positive (PCR) should I stay quarantined and self isolate, get retested? In my area I've been told that I'll be fine to go back to work in the food industry after 2weeks without needing to be retested. I don't understand that certainty if I still tested positive 6weeks after onset of symptoms! Am I infectious or not?! </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> self inflicted gunshot to the head......cause of death.....COV19. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> ‪Dr., please consider posting a list of latest best practices for supporting optimal immunity (with disclaimer) at the end of each video? Great work deserves a wider audience. folks will pass simple advice along.‬ </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Are Rh Negatives immune to Covid-19? </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Can you explain what actually happened to those 100 over patients that were retested positive of covid 19, since reinfection is unlikely, could it be reactivation, like the herpes? </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> What about these docs?
https://youtu.be/xfLVxx_lBLU </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Thats the big question tho, is the covid virus mutating. And will it do so yearly like other flu viruses do. As some suggest it will return yearly. I was reading about overseas where those who had it and got rid of it, at a later point got it again. So were left with more questions it seems relating to is it mutating and how fast. Because with a new mutation means the human body must repeat the whole sickness process all over again to develop antibodies against it. One reference to this is at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToI_C7gKjtk </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Are you correct about saying sensitivity and specificity about antibody test? I'm afraid you are confusing those 2 words and actually you are totally misunderstanding each other. Per wikipedia, test sensitivity is the ability of a test to correctly identify those with the disease (true positive rate), whereas test specificity is the ability of the test to correctly identify those without the disease (true negative rate). Right? Or did I confuse what you explained??? </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Thank you for your impressive presentations, dear Doctor. I would like to ask you your opinion about  the meaning of my test IgM “not reactive” and IgG “borderline” (chemoluninescent test CLIA). I did not have any symptoms since 4 weeks at now, and I did have contacts with positive, severe patients.
Moreover: was detection of IgG performed in reinfected monkeys? Kind regards and thank you for you precious job </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Thank you for explaining this in common language. I wouldn't have possibly understood this in a million years, had I read the medical journals/research you cited, myself.

More power to your channel and thank you again. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> With the high level of comments on here. Can an educated person tell me why people are protesting? </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> So you could say after this research that herd immunity is most likely for those that have recovered from the virus and that a gradual removal of government restriction will only result in infection of those that have not been through an infection. 

Slightly off the subject but is there an indication that the seriousness of a case is proportionate to the concentration of the virus? </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> The data being used to generate the lethality rate of coronavirus (with which one can become infected) and COVID-19 (the actual disease which may or may not occur if one actually has the coronavirus) is highly unreliable. First of all, the CDC on their website writes concerning the "sequences" they are relying on to indicate the presence of the coronavirus that "every effort has been made to assure the accuracy of the sequence, but CDC cannot provide ANY WARRANT regarding their accuracy." (emp. mine).

Second, Steven Schwarz, the director of the Division of Vital Statistics, sent out a directive stating that one should report CV-19 as the cause of death if either it DID cause the death OR is ASSUMED to have caused the death. He then adds that if the person ALSO had COPD, asthma, etc., that should be reported IN PART II. (Why just 'Part II') The "assumption" clause introduces a healthy dose of arbitrariness into a stew already brewing with a test that the CDC refuses to endorse.

It gets worse. Dr. Cameron Kyle-Sidell has testified that while running an ICU at Maimonides dedicated exclusively to the WORST cases of CV-19 he has not seen even ONE case where CV-19 is conjoined to pneumonia. Instead, he has seen something like altitude sickness (from people who have been nowhere near a mountain recently!). The upshot: the medical community the whole world over has been told that CV-19 CAUSES pneumonia. Hence, if someone happens to test positive (even falsely, as it may be reasonably inferred, will happen quite often with a test of uncertain accuracy) AND has pneumonia or influenza AND dies . . . well, then that will go down in history as a death caused by CV-19.

Bad test + giving license to subjective assumptions + total misunderstanding of whatever the disease is = throw out the numbers & redo them on the basis of correct information and responsible reporting rules.

 Just in: deaths from pneumonia, heart attack, and stroke are ALL down from Dec. '19 through April, '20. Give yourself one guess why . . .

One more: a Stanford study based on a test for anti-bodies has concluded that in one region in CA, from 50 to 80× more persons have been infected than originally thought. Dr. Bhattacharya said this could lower the lethality of the coronavirus to slightly worse or double (flu: 1/1000, cv19: 1/500-1/999, .02% at worst) that of influenza. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Please explain, why those who do "virology" that the testing give a "false positive" and "false negative".
Please also explain WHY these doctors of having issues with this virus.

<TAGS> None </TAGS>
<COMMENT 1> I had covid 19 and I had 13 of the 14 things that happened to me. However I went to the hospital and then I was put on a ventilator for 9 days. I stayed in the hospital 25 days. These symptoms are no joke. God is good I survived it. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> These symptoms tips are becoming like a bazaar , everyone is out there . The sensible thing would be to contact your doctor if you have any qualms . There is general neurosis everybody seems to have one or the other of 10 to 14 symptoms . </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> a doctor with the name 'Khan' reminds us of the leader of the Mongols that are today carrying out Genocide in Indonesia and killing my friends..is hard to watch him making not a mention of the Genocide but then he wouldn't just don't care </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Very good synopsis, so much more comprehensive than most videos. Thank you for taking the time to inform. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Who IS this clown?  Could they have picked a WORSE spokesman for symptoms of a virus pandemic?  I mean, I have nothing against his accent, but my god, his delivery and ridiculous attitude are incredibly annoying to watch and listen to. And to add insult to injury, the guy tells the symptoms in REVERSE order of importance so we have to watch his awful delivery until the very end.  Ha! Very funny!!! </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> I got a redeye wich started to develop yesterdey and this evening I got fever, no other symptoms fingers crossed. Hope its not corona. </COMMENT 6>

<COMMENT 11> Hi Sir, I loss my sense of smell and taste,  but Ill ask you later a question.   Because two months already that I'm using iodine and Vicks and put it in my nose before I wear my mask as added protection when I go outside.  And take note. I used two mask also.    And if I'm in my room, I used a diffuser machine .  in the machine, I added an iodine and essential oil, so that I can make my room smell nice and also disinfects by the iodine.    So my question, is over using use of iodine and Vicks, both putting directly my nose and by breathing it might cause an infection to my nose with my frequent use of this two things?   Please reply.

Note: june2 today, 3rd day of loss of Smell and taste. </COMMENT 11>

<COMMENT 13> I've had stomach pain, nausea, dizziness, blurred vision, migraine headache, swelled glands, coughing up mucus, feeling like I can't swallow, muscle and back pain, and no appetite, I am extremely tired.I actually went to the E R they did not test me for the virus, I have not had any fever. I was diagnosed with pharyngitis and sent home. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Maybe in addition to sending out money, the govt should also send out ounces of the very best medical marijuana. That would chill people out AND quell flu symptoms. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Who ya pointing at doc?  haha!  And did you have high blood pressure before you caught it?  https://youtu.be/mzluiL-_eeM </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> I have "air hunger" and dizziness from just wearing the mask all day! And I have a dry cough from my asthma! </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> It's  my  stomach doesn't feel good  I can't tell  that all  and  yes  I do get diarrhea and shortness of breathing too as well </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> I think this virus feel same like patient face dengue fever. Starting high fever that can make organ inside got strong heat make more dihydrate untill bleeding and  if not seeking intention medication you will die. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> I have been feeling a bit unwell but today I woke up feeling dizzy </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> If a person has only one symptom of short in breathings. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 20> Why is the media not getting other scientists to weigh in on the pros and cons are about what we are doing in terms of dealing with the COVID-19 Pandemic.  NO person knows enough to emphatically state what will happen or what needs to be done.  Please go to this link https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m1924.  Yes, using history is logical but in studying the peer reviewed studies, if you take the time to keep up with them, you will see that there are no hard dogmatic principles and timelines in many cases.  I would like to see more hard sciences used to address the problem in an unemotional manner. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 1> The world should nuke the great wall of china. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Please be accessible and narate questions. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Alguien que lo resuma en español? 😔 </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> It’s rather amazing how every answer is predicated on erroneous assumptions which lead to not answering the question at all. You almost never get the right answer from incorrect premises. What has happened to the standards of scholarship in the UK? </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Calum Williams is so cute </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> So many different options with no real guidance </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Bet there will be better pandemic prep </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> The end of Hog Factory farming and needless animal suffering is something I desperately hope to see in my life time. The only reason they are being bred in this way is because they are the most profitable meat industry in the world. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> So you guys are economists but you need to think like a normal business man, after this for a long time, a lot of people will not wanna do business with China. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Unbelievable - this is probably the worst economic overview/forecast assessment  I have seen in a long time - reminds me of a high school presentation.  Pretty sick to consider this is coming from The Economist. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> I’m sorry but I just find this way too odd, the Wuhan market was a lie. The people working at the lab who worried about the pandemic breaking from their Wuhan lab were shut up by their government and the only countries that are looking into the origins are Australia who was threatened by China and the UK who has proposed to sue the country. This is clearly a silent war made by China and I just can’t believe otherwise and neither can the mentioned countries.. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> What a numpty. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Another video claiming that China will overtake the US.... not going to happen.
China gave loans to underdeveloped countries in Africa and around the World for hundreds of billions of dollars and all of those countries will default on those loans, many have already gave notice that they won’t be able to pay, that will hit China’s economy very hard.
Also, China’s image around the World took a huge hit, then add their latest policies in Hong Kong and their hostile approach to Taiwan, all of that equals to being the most hated country in the World right now.
I can see USA and other countries imposing penalties on China for the foreseeable future and companies transferring their manufacturing either back to their home country or to another country in Asia like Indonesia for example.
China knows this whole virus thing was a slap on the face to their image, there is a reason their propaganda machine is working 24/7 now to save face.
You claim on this video that their economy is back to 90% of their normalcy, that is completely inaccurate, you can turn on the factories and the machines but if there is no demand for their product then guess what, it doesn’t work. Everyone is saving whatever little money they have to ride this out, countries like the US will recover much faster than China. 
And if worst come to worst we always have the greatest military power this World has ever seen, no way for China to match our force. The US will keep being at the top of the food chain for many more years to come, deal with it. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Lots of stuttering and they seemed to be winging it. No depth in their comments. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Can we called it the ultimate disruptor?  I think so. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Will movie theaters have anyone in them </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> We will always prevail over pandemics. Nothing can stop the human becoming superior over pandemicd. In fact, human can always improve faster with great acceleration when besets by natural catastrophe. Human invent, create, and find ways to develop advance technology. The human mind is limitless with ideas to create. The human mind can create out of nothing to something that can continuously provide him the ability to create more something that the he needs ease his existence free from difficulties. And it will continue, and contiinue to galactic enter planetary existence. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Political virus that kills USA not the Virus. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> There will be no "New Normal".  Give it up.  Not going to happen.  
A year from now you will realize how silly people sounded even thinking the world would make permanent changes for a temporary problem. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> For us we believe in awareness! Thanks for sharing awareness! Also Looking into other concepts to be aware of after this time! </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 9> Tomorrow hopefully is two weeks with no new cases. That means that we can hopefully go back almost normal </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> 1 month later. 12 days without any new cases. Go New Zealand. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> I vote Jacinta as world leader! </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> The Kiwi country knows it's ways. I'm proud of them. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Greetings from New Zealand as of June 1st 2020 we have only had 22 deaths from covid 19 and life in our country is getting back to normal </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> The latest Law just passed by Jacinda Ardern is police can now enter anyone house in New Zealand without a warrant </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Australia has done similarly well without clamping down as hard. And Australia has a much more urbanised population. 

If Americans want to know why their statistics are so bad, they need to ask the New York governor why he forced aged care centres to accept people who were sick with Coronavirus, thus causing a massive toll among the most vulnerable. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Its probably been 2 weeks in NZ where there is no cases </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Wait until the flu season comes and you will know New Zealand never had a strategy </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Living in New Zealand since 2003. And this is why I chose New Zealand over other countries. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> May 30th . Nine days no new cases, but weather or not the PM picked the correct strategy for the long term is yet to be seen. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> It isn't as rosy as people think. Yes, we have eradicated covid 19 , but the shit is about to hit the fan when it comes to our economy. Jacinda is really only good at smiling. Not much else. But I guess it doesn't take much to be a better leader than Trump. Thats just embarrassing. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 2> W.H.O. IS ....... A CHINESE PUPPET. WORLD IS ALREADY SUFFERING DUE TO W.H.O.'S MISTAKES. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Thank you </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Put a disclaimer on your video. Not recommending, not s cure, just my opinion, etc. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Sweden is in real trouble https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysm8UJZtc-8 </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> well, the WHO says that people should be 3 feet apart to "socially distance". Isn't the six feet thing contradictory to that and shouldn't like half the world's videos be taken down now? lol </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Censored medical reports and removal of scientific research on Vitamin D, C, etc.  But the YT police want the medical research deleted and order us to pray for Vaccines....Mandatory, forced vaccines...Line up...Wait, Don’t be me. I am an M.D. but let me tell you what you do not know about vaccines and what I didn’t know and what 90% of all M.D.'s do not know and what No politician knows... I did not know that Vaccines had not been tested against any placebo (ever). I did not know that animal testing would be skipped for the future COVID vaccines..I did not know the 30+ ingredients used in vaccines. I did not know that there are neurotoxic aluminum and mercury molecules in vaccines. I did not know enough to research vaccines before vaccinating my own children. 
I did not know that my own precocious, active, talking son would be vaccine-injured. 
I did not know that my own baby brother (also an M.D.) would become paralyzed (Guillain-Barre) and then die after his swine flu vaccine in the same hospital (Shands) where he had received his medical training. 
I did not know that my mother(an R.N.) would get 8 vaccines in 1 day to "catch-up" with newly added CDC vaccines to keep her job as Head Nurse in the Largest Hospital in the county and then get such severe, aggressive, progressive brain fog in days and become unable to dial a phone or push an elevator button or remember any of her  5 children in a few weeks and then have this "dementia" progress and then die in diapers
I did not know that vaccines were given a blanket indemnity from liability in 1986 and now total immunity for all COVID vaccines for the future. I did not know that we gave more vaccines than any other country starting on day #1...I did not know that we have the highest rate of SIDS of the top 35 industrialized countries... I did not know that we had more autism than any other country... I did not know that Vaccines could injure an infant's brain. 
I did not know that vaccines can result in autoimmunity and neurological damage. I did not know that herd immunity does not apply to vaccines and is a myth created by the CDC. I did not know that Vaccines have almost no effect after about four years. 
I did not know how emotional the topic would be and how angry people would be at me for just asking questions about Vaccine Safety. I did not know that pediatricians were paid to give vaccines. I did not know that the CDC owned the Patents on so many vaccines. 
I did not know that the NIH stands to make Billions of dollars on a COVID vaccine. 
I did not know how angry at myself I would be for not knowing. I did not know that the CDC committed fraud and destroyed their evidence in their vaccine safety studies when it showed vaccines can cause autistic neurological changes..I did not know that a whistleblower came forward with all the evidence but he was silenced. I did not know that Merck committed fraud in their vaccine research repeatedly. I did not know that aluminum molecules in the vaccine ingredients is connected to brain inflammation and brain inflammation has been proven to be connected to autism. 
I did not know that vaccines contained human cells from aborted fetuses..
I did not know how much mainstream media would censor the independent research that showed these facts...I did not know that 90% of all vaccine research that the CDC and FDA use to "approve" vaccines are done by the scientists hired by vaccine makers..I did not know if we were alone... I did not know how many other millions of parents and families in the world have been affected by vaccine reactions..
I did not know how many would find, join, and share the Facebook help group= Vaccine Support Group on Facebook..I did not know that FB would delete the scientific medical research that had been suppressed, deleted, or censored until it happened to us...  Dr.MAS.. </COMMENT 7>

<COMMENT 9> Use Telegram to share. Whatsapp (Facebook property) uses that of limiting the number of shares to 5 for preventing chains. Whatsapp is, even more than a messaging tool, a censorship tool. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Youtube talking head identifies VitC and Turmeric as two examples of Youtube snake oil. Ok. Never mind that both are redundantly shown to be powerful anti-inflammatories, and that C ascorbate or IV mitigates against neutrophil nets. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Welcome to censorship!!!! </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Thank you doctor! </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Let's hope your video brings some sense back to the youtube censorship police. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Not a balanced video.  There are negative sides of effects to too much Vitamin D, including liver damage.  
I think the following is a much better read on the subject of Vitamin D https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/taking-too-much-vitamin-d-can-cloud-its-benefits-and-create-health-risks
Based on the theory, countries that consume high levels of Vitamin D as part of their diet should see lower rates.  Fish, eggs, and milk are a great source of Vitamin D, hence could be cross-referenced with countries with per-capita consumption of these foods.  China & Japan has a very high level of fish & egg consumption per-capita, and it looks like they have a low rate of COVID-19 deaths per-capita. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Thank you for continuing to publish videos and for your ongoing hunt for the best available information. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Thank you for your "opinionated" opinion. 
In deigning to "be opinionated", youi're feeling the birthing-pains of exiting the ivory-tower. 
I think that being an ^ivory-tower^ *irrelevent* intellectual is a far more-harmful possibilty 
than the possibility of you being ^too opinionated^ (whatever that may mean). 
The fact that you are a practicioner of a profession (a "doctoring" one no less) 
does not mean that Freedom of Speech,, Freedom of Conscience, association, etc. do not apply to you; 
you did not give up your natural rights as a free human being when you became a doctor. 
Please, sir: Rock on! </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Thumbs up! </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Yes! Wonderful and well balanced discussion. I have been on C and D daily and I know it is equipping my immune system to better respond to SARS2 and other viruses </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> You should check out channels that criticise Islamic ideology. They are the ones hit hard by youtube censorship. Youtube sometimes consider presenting evidence-based facts as hate speech or something of that sort. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> You are dead right. What youtube have been doing is boneheaded or worse, compromised maybe. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 2> There has been so much fraud surrounding this ‘thing’ that it is impossible to know what is true or not.  Especially anything coming from a Democrat supporting State. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> I am not a medical nor a biomedical science professional. But, thanks to MedCram and the amazing Dr Seheult I learned so much more and that promoted me to collect my thoughts in a paper summarizing what I learned from the videos and all the research papers referenced. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> I am sharing your videos.  I have relatives in Adelanto and Apple Valley CA I think it might be near San Bernardino because they have mentioned this area. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> A study involving Covid19 patients with Von Willebrand Disease might support that hypothesis.
Great video! Thanks. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> I have read studies on the affect of N-acetyl cysteine in relationship to pulmonary hypertension. The studies have contradicted themselves, with some showing (in rats) that it increases PH, while in others it is suggested that NAC may be a treatment for PH.

I am currently supplementing with NAC and have hypertension. I started on this supplementation after viewing your videos on COVID 19. 

Could you please clarify this NAC PH connection? Perhaps you can address this in one of your videos. 

Thank you very much. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Yes yes, 8 people on ventilators. It's 11-13 patients like these here in my ICU. Getting a bit "sick" from all this pandemic. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Shots for the sheeple </COMMENT 8>

<COMMENT 10> You're being a little loosey goosey by stating that your hypothesis is validated by these results. Please keep in mind that your mostly layman followers are looking to you for information. There is even a little hero worship evident in some their posts. This behooves you the be stringent in your use of terminology. Otherwise, I enjoy your offerings. You offer another valuable information stream about this important subject. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> I love these videos.  Thank you.  In one of your other videos, mention was made regarding oxygen being a key factor in assisting recovery from Covid.  In this video mention was made of not using ventilation until patients have difficulty breathing it on their own.  Why not put the Covid patients on ventilation treatments immediately to evaluate whether patients have quicker recovery time?  This would ensure they are getting precise oxygen amounts as soon as Covid-19 is detected. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> The notion that exposure to the 'other four' human coronaviruses which cause colds can cross-protect against SARS-Cov2 might explain the paradox of smokers having better COVID-19 survival: Since its well-documented that smokers experience more episodes of  bronchitis and pneumonia than non-smokers, it would follow that they have more exposure to common viruses including coronaviruses, and hence, harbor more antibodies that are cross-protective. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> in fact, the flu in 1969 has caused the same type of blood clots - https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/s-0028-1108874
...and thrombosis in covid-19 is already known for months... Journalists should do some more serious research rather than spreading panic and fear. In 1969 blood thinner could dramatically reduce mortality of infected persons </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> This video was disapproved by 83 people who were hoping to see Bevis and Butthead talking. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> This likely means a covid vaccine would provide protection against some of the common cold coronaviruses....the problem is big pharma would not like that.... </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Wow,  so they finally acknowledge people may have some partial immunity from being infected by one of the 4 common cold coronavirus....
Doesn't take a einstein to figure that out....now they need to see if they people who had activated t-cells have kids under 12 who constantly get sick with virus after virus and bring them home.  I cant count the times I got sick from my kids bringing something home from school or day care. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Quercetin and alkaline water?????????
Doc. I urge you to please take a look into this, in regards to supplemental research. Please make a short video on this topic if it's of any importance. Thanks
-future doctor Brudnicki-Tennessee </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Great research which doesn't appear in mainstream media in my country. I don't know if i understood it right but probably covid 19 gives a long lasting immunity. And some  people not infected with covid 19 have T-Cells recognizing Sars-Cov2 cause some of it proteins are similar to other coronaviruses. If that's the fact does it mean that we need a lower percentage of people infected with Sars-Cov2 for the pandemic to burn itself out casue some people will never become because of the proteins triggered by other cov infections. My conclusion (may be wrong) is that pandemic is gonna end sooner until the vaccine is ready and we will not need the vaccine already. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Is that mean if we infect people with other coronavirus which is not lethal or consequences are common cold might help to educate T cell which helps our immune system to fight back Sars-Cov-2 in more profound way? </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> To take the time to break down a complicated subject and make it understandable to the layman like me is a tribute to a great educator, amazing patience, a great doctor. Thank you doc, youre an amazing credit to your proffesion . </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 7> Fake news and lies </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Interesting video, What we needed was a part 2 to this video, We needed another set where his hands were washed of as much or all of the paint he had placed on his body then conduct the same study to see if anything shows up then we can see how well using safe practices work. i believe the  first set was to instill fear. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> And this video shows why masks are particularly dangerous to wear. Not only are they harmful to your lungs if worn long periods of time, especially if you have asthma, you can breathe in the virus, which is 120 nm in size THROUGH the holes of an n95 mask, which are 300 nm in size... And you can also breath it OFF the mask that over time gets stained with the virus as you touch it with your hands and you walk through aerosol clouds. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Should be thanking all frontliners and medical health workers for their service. They play a big role to combat this pandemic. Mass testing should really be done as soon as possible.
Does anyone know where can I buy Covid-19 Antibody testing kit? </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Attention Everyone. Whats with the lady from Adelaide who contracted COVID-19 on the Ruby Princess with her husband. He died and she recovered and was given the all clear. Well she has it again and our State Gov is not counting it as a new infection and treating it as an old infection. She apparently has been out and about. This proves it can re-erupt in a recovered person to full blown COVID-19 </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> BS information for dumb people. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> While this a great illustration of how easily fluorescent paint can spread, it leaves out the fact there needs to be enough of the viral particles actually in ones system. If there are not enough of the viral particles, then one won't get the virus. No idea how many viral particles are needed for the flu, the common cold, or for Covid-19. The video is over simplified. And another person pointed out there was more to the study as to if employees served the food, there was little spread. Watching this just underscores to me the importance of frequent hand washing. And probably continuing to go to restaurants that are not self serve. I've never been a big buffet person regardless of germ spreading or not spreading. </COMMENT 13>

Mankind made the same mistake a century ago, trying to eradicate an airborne virus with disinfectants & detergents instead of with eucalyptus oil. Only when they started using Vicks & similar remedies, the  Spanish Flu was finally contained. Simply blow Vicks around from fans & air-conditioners. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Can you guys please repeat the same film over and over again? I didn't see it enough the first 3 times </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Fack coronavirus fack </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> The theory is sound, but the draw back is it is assuming the virus multiplies fast enough they there is enough virus itself to spread that far, wide and heavily. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Sperm everywhere </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> All this useful information from the TV show that did a test segment shooting a cannon in the direction of a housing tract in Danville, CA.

<COMMENT 13> Fredo is, by far, the biggest douchebag on television.  Very often, when interviewing people, he turns the interview around to try to flatter himself.

Watch big brother YouTube and their lame parent Google, delete this comment. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> You are literally the healthiest person to “suffer” from this..... you are full of crap. You absolutely never had covid19, you self aggrandize at every turn. Your selfie workout videos alone should expose your narcissism, yet somehow your followers ignore this or choose to ignore it. It amazes me that those who claim to be “libertarian” willingly ignore the actions you’ve personally taken as well as fraudulent claim of actually being seriously affected by the virus. I know multiple people who we infected with the virus and they were incapable of doing an entire podcast.... you sir are a bullshit artist who lies to advance yourself because that’s all you’ve ever known. Make no mistake that the majority see right through you. You time in the limelight will soon fade. Then you’ll be stuck with your self aggrandizing workout videos to get you through.

<COMMENT 1> These  vaccine makers does not have any idea about covid -19 viruses' structural changes while replicating..First answer such silly questions and then make vaccine if they want to succeed in their hard works. </COMMENT 1>

<COMMENT 3> These pieces of garbage better not take away my way to work by forcing me to get this the keys hopefully Canada does with the states did bring this country to the fucking ground if there's no more freedom then why have a country </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Vaccines....Will everybody be forced to get mandatory, forced vaccines?...Don’t be me. I am an M.D. but let me tell you what you do not know about vaccines and what I didn’t know and what 90% of all M.D.'s do not know and what No politician knows... I did not know that Vaccines had not been tested against any placebo (ever). I did not know that animal testing would be skipped for the future COVID vaccines..I did not know the 30+ ingredients used in vaccines. I did not know that there are neurotoxic aluminum and mercury molecules in vaccines. I did not know enough to research vaccines before vaccinating my own children. 
I did not know that my own precocious, active, talking son would be vaccine-injured. I did not know that my own baby brother (also an M.D.) would become paralyzed (Guillain-Barre) and then die after his swine flu vaccine in the same hospital (Shands) where he had received his medical training. I did not know that my mother(an R.N.) would get 8 vaccines in 1 day to "catch-up" with newly added CDC vaccines to keep her job as Head Nurse in the Largest Hospital in the county and then get such severe, aggressive, progressive brain fog in days and become unable to dial a phone or push an elevator button or remember any of her  5 children in a few weeks and then have this "dementia" progress and then die in diapers


I did not know that vaccines were given a blanket indemnity from liability in 1986 and now total immunity for all COVID vaccines for the future. I did not know that we gave more vaccines than any other country starting on day #1...I did not know that we have the highest rate of SIDS of the top 35 industrialized countries... I did not know that we had more autism than any other country... I did not know that Vaccines could injure an infant's brain. 


I did not know that vaccines can result in autoimmunity and neurological damage. I did not know that herd immunity does not apply to vaccines and is a myth created by the CDC. I did not know that Vaccines have almost no effect after about four years. 


I did not know how emotional the topic would be and how angry people would be at me for just asking questions about Vaccine Safety. I did not know that pediatricians were paid to give vaccines. I did not know that the CDC owned the Patents on so many vaccines. 
I did not know that the NIH stands to make Billions of dollars on a COVID vaccine. 


I did not know how angry at myself I would be for not knowing. I did not know that the CDC committed fraud and destroyed their evidence in their vaccine safety studies when it showed vaccines can cause autistic neurological changes..I did not know that a whistleblower came forward with all the evidence but he was silenced. I did not know that Merck committed fraud in their vaccine research repeatedly. I did not know that aluminum molecules in the vaccine ingredients is connected to brain inflammation and brain inflammation has been proven to be connected to autism. 
I did not know that vaccines contained human cells from aborted fetuses..


I did not know how much mainstream media would censor the independent research that showed these facts...I did not know that 90% of all vaccine research that the CDC and FDA use to "approve" vaccines are done by the scientists hired by vaccine makers..I did not know if we were alone... I did not know how many other millions of parents and families in the world have been affected by vaccine reactions..I did not know how many would find, join, and share the Facebook help group= Vaccine Support Group on Facebook..I did not know that FB would delete the scientific medical research that had been suppressed, deleted, or censored until it happened to us...  Dr.MAS.. </COMMENT 4>

<COMMENT 1> I mentioned the doctors from the UK, US and Italy that have died as I'd just been reading about them but also wish to pay tribute to all healthcare professionals that have lost their lives across the world, in China, Iran and beyond.

<COMMENT 8> Soooo, now that the TRUE numbers are out you want to perhaps retract some of this information? Covid death percentage is currently slightly higher than the flu with the elderly and obese most at risk. I think we will see it be even lower than the flu as more scientists and health organizations (who aren’t selling the story of fear and NOT silenced for going against the mainstream narrative) are heard. Maybe you should talk more about how to keep our immune systems strong and the obesity health crisis! 
FYI  : YouTube puts a nice little government health add on your video even though you aren’t “affiliated” with any particular organization. 🤔 </COMMENT 8>

<COMMENT 10> the cdc in its official data release analyzed all deaths to date and published the results . Broke the deaths into 10 categories that account for over 90% of the pie (ie of all deaths). Those 10 categories were SEVERE illnesses such as kidney failure PRIOR to virus, organ failure PRIOR to virus, organ transplant patients, etc .It is in fact fair to say that those groups involved mostly people who may well have died from any shock such as a flu, etc. So this "doctor" is speaking without any justification. And let's quit talking to "doctors" since they are not very educated in theoretical science. He says that one indicator of COVID is that they are more likely to need ventillators. LOL, guess he missed the NYTimes where it was said that they now say that ventillators do more harm than good. Again, let's ban doctors. My doctor smokes! THey are not scientists: they are good studiers who want to have a prestigious well paying job. Not the same as a PhD in molecular biology who studies the structure of the virus.  There are plenty of Nobel prize winners in biology who dispute the severity of the virus based on DATA --as opposed to some nurse or doctor who blabs emotionally about the patient they saw who coughed ,gripped their hand and died. LOL --I'll take data please. 3 grad degrees in science here by the way. </COMMENT 10>

<COMMENT 12> I don't know the life expectancy numbers from UK, but they should be similar enough to Sweden, meaning close to 85 years. A typical 60 year old person should expect to live another 20-25 years, on average. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> The biggest lie about Covid-19 is that Covid-19 exists. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Hilarious to quote statistics when the press, the government and DOCTORS have been proven to be liars over and over in this mess. Right now we have protesters filling the streets and getting a pass from the doctors and nurses "because white supremacy is worse than COVID." And why are they protesting? Because a cop killed someone. Cops in America kill about 1400 people a year, and nearly every one of those is a justifiable shooting; in other words, it's the cop's job to take that lunatic down. On the other hand, doctors in America kill 100,000 a year due to arrogance, incompetence, and the fact that most of their procedures and drugs are bad ideas to begin with. We should be in the street protesting doctors and the pharmaceutical companies that pull their strings. </COMMENT 14>

Cattle being led to slaughter...
Another sad form of population control. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> They sadly tell us that 370,000 have sadly died worldwide from various causes over the last 5 months although none of which have been from Covid 19,as Covid 19 is a total made up bullshit virus to scare and control the population and only morons and people that can’t think for themselves would believe it.
Every time somebody dies whether it be from heart attack,stroke,car accident,falling out of a plane,drowning,getting kicked to death by a horse in a hoop skirt,they just write Covid 19 on the death certificate......If it wasn’t so sick it would be funny !
Last year over 650,000 people worldwide died of influenza alone ! </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Doctors die just like everyone else (sorry docs but it seems you may not know that). So some docs die during this pandemic. They get in car accidents, get hit by buses, fall off places. All the deaths are of course corona virus deaths so the satanists on mainstream media can raise hysteria and acceptance for the Bill Gates vaccine agenda. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> 4brevard.com/corona.shtml 
Why are doctors not using a machine that oxygenates blood directly, instead of causing a cytokine storm with a lung tube?
80% on tube die.
Appropriate armour is in the link. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> If you put those patients on the ventilator, they blow up your longs </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> They should use the ventilators earlier... except when in NY, because there it has a 90% death rate. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 3> That's because it was in the flu vaccine that's why people a false positive just like it was in one of the vaccines that gave people HIV </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> I´ll do 250 antibody testes to my employees. I think the prevalence of my city is under 5%. In this case, is this tests useless ? </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> I have read studies on the affect of N-acetyl cysteine in relationship to pulmonary hypertension. The studies have contradicted themselves, with some showing (in rats) that it increases PH, while in others it is suggested that NAC may be a treatment for PH.

I am currently supplementing with NAC and have hypertension. I started on this supplementation after viewing your videos on COVID 19. 

Could you please clarify this NAC PH connection? Perhaps you can address this in one of your videos. 

Thank you very much. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> We have antibody tests with 100% specificity, FDA approved already, why are we still using tests with lower accuracy? https://www.bing.com/search?q=fda+antibody+test+100%25+specificity&pc=U316&form=CHRDEF&sp=-1&pq=fda+antibody+test+100%25+specificity&sc=0-34&qs=n&sk=&cvid=E488113C901C4DCB9556528512114119 </COMMENT 6>

<COMMENT 9> The thing is. Fiction,Time and so much more  is made up by humans. How do we not know that every thought we think and make up new creatures and world's. They say our brains are like coumputers. How do we not know that everything we think. Like what we imagine is created from a data base inside our brain. That would mean that we have knowledge or every plant,star,and life form in the universe and maybe we haven't woke up to our true ability yet. That's why when we make movies,books,and video games, those things are really real just on another planet (maybe)  and we are starting to wake up . When we are able to see inside our conscience (dreams when we sleep) see this knowledge and learn how to tap into out inner knowledge in our brains. That's why some books movies tv shows really come true because we are able to predict our future we just dont realize it or understand how to use it.
Just some ideas that I had today and needed to share with everyone! </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> I just took a Blue Horizon test from UK 100% sensitive and 99.63% specific. So I'm pretty confident it will be correct. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Why are there false positives? What is the Covid antibody test reacting to? Prior colds or flu? </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> God bless you doc </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> What if the prevalence in a workplace is very high, and a person wants to be tested, shouldn’t this be the figure used in computing true positives and negatives, rather than the prevalence in the population as a whole? </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Small quibble:  If 100 people have the disease and the prevalence is 5%, then those free of the disease number 1900, not 2000. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Thank you! I never fully understood this concept until watching this video </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> https://hosgadgets.store/collections/be-safe-in-covid-19/products/safe-protection-aluminum-alloy-gadget </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> FALSE POSITIVES - INFLATED CASE NUMBERS - Dr Deborah Birx warned long ago and CDC have just now finally admitted it too!
"If you have 1% of the population infected and you have a test that is only
 99% specific, then if you find a positive, then 50% of time it will be a
 real positive and 50% of time it won't be! [ie, it will be a false 
positive]".

<COMMENT 18> Thank you.  I've seen every video on COVID-19 and have learned so much.  In today's video, I'm shocked and saddened to hear that Ford is going to contribute so much more air pollution (and noise pollution) in their Police SUVs that will rev high for 15 minutes to reach 133 degrees.  That's going to damage a lot of lung in a lot of people.   See:   Dr. John Campbell's video of today on Air Pollution's effect regarding well, anyone's lungs anytime, but also specifically re. to  COVID-19

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lM_KKUWRMo </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Have you or others put into clinical practice testing and determining the ratio between glutathione and measures of oxidative stress to help determine COVID 19 outcomes and whether anti-oxidant supplements work?  If so what clinical labs are doing accurate tests of these determinants? </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Fantastic explanation and demonstration! </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 3> I am O rh negative  possibly of Northern European and Native American </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Thank you Drbeen can you discuss the origin of the viurs and if it is lab manufactured or naturally spread. and why it has this virility compared to other corona virus that had natural spread before like Mers-Cov </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Thank you Drbeen fo the great presentation. can you please discuss  why some young health individuals die from covid-19? </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Lyme disease and Mogellons disease....not DELUSIONAL  at all.......help me please </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Take  Vitamins ABC  D3 And zinc </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> If the numbers are correct I don't believe they  are You are following the incorrect data   Everyone   Has  Corona  Virus in their  Body And the tests has a positive and negative results false negatives </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> 47 percent of African Americans are O positive as opposed to 33 percent of whites. So 24 percent of African Americans are A positive. Factor that. Data shmater. I don't believe their data. Do your research. It was out and out neglect because of race but you'd be afraid to say it. If this von milliebrand factor were true, how do you explain the low rate of Covid in Africa? You are just going with the narrative but never mentioned that O blood type is the predominant blood type among BLACKS. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> This was the best info doc.   You connected all the dots! </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> I wish someone would do a study on the RH factor like negative blood?? I heard that negative blood fight off viruses better! I heard that a negative blood can’t get aids? And the only survivors during the Black Plague hundreds of years ago was RH negative blood type?? Could you do some research on this topic I’m very interested in knowing thank you I just found your channel and subscribed 👍👍👍 god bless ya </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Thanks Doc.  This was very informative </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Does the black community have a higher instance of type a blood? Or is there no correlation there? </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> So, is the reason why people with blood type A may get the worst cases of Covid-19 is because of Thrombosis? </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Black seed oil really work against blood clots forming in the body. It helps your blood to separating and move together smoothly and together. </COMMENT 15>

<COMMENT 8> I'll depend on my own body to defend itself without injecting foreign things directly into my bloodstream... bypassing all of the body's natural defences. I've managed to stay alive and healthy for almost 70 years with this philosophy. I'd rather be infected with the virus than get vaccinated. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Is intubation the same as incubation ? </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Excellent video as always.  I am an RN and I work in a hospital in the south.  We are just beginning to see covid 19 patients.  We are tracking and managing our ppe very carefully.  But we had staff do a hand hygiene tracker.  They found our hand washing rate to be around 30% which is appalling.  Everyone is just relying on the hand sanitizer outside every room.  Its better than nothing,  but if you are taking off a pair of gloves,  you should be washing your hands.  I think the virus is going to cause us all to be more serious about hand washing. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Thank you doctor mike for the info Godbless Stay safe ❤️ </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Here’s a question: do basic medical masks (like the one in my profile photo) work? A cashier at the gas station went on a tirade about how they are entirely useless and only air sealed N95 masks work. Is this true? (I am a healthcare worker, btw. I just want to know if what I’m using is enough, since it’s all we have..) </COMMENT 12>

<COMMENT 18> If we get infected do we develop antibodies for immunity? Dr John Campbell suggested that patients who may have been reinfected May have in fact harboured the disease for longer than expected? Thoughts? </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Could you explain the statistics in real numbers? For example 1% sounds small but could equate to 100,000 people - which is ALOT. Thanks. Good job, by the way. Thank you. </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 8> Presuming you are getting accurate data from other countries. I expect the number of cases in China is at least one magnitude higher. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> @minutephysics, I'm afraid you have a SERIOUS error here. What you are plotting is log(dy/dt) vs. log(y), so a straight line means log(dy/dt) = k*log(y), or dy/dt = y^k. 
Thus, y = exp(integral of y^(k-1)*t). Since k < 1, this is an exponential only in form because as y grows the y^(k-1) term shrinks. If k = 0.5, then by the time there are a million cases, that term is 10^-5 of the value it started out with, assuming that k stayed constant. </COMMENT 9>

<COMMENT 14> The Philippines is handling this horribly. We don't even know how our curve looks because the government won't conduct mass testing as adequate levels. And we're relaxing quarantine measures (after THREE MONTHS) before we've even seen any evidence that the curve is flattening. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Roses are red violets are blue why does the Karen think covid-19 is just the ordinary flu </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Can you revisit with current data and talk about why so many countries demonstrate exponential decay, but not USA?  I also tried looking at new cases as ppm and displayed not as absolute numbers but rate of change. There appears to be a period "bump" approximately every 7 days.  Is this real or a result of how data is collected? </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> How's india doing ?Plz reply </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Lately, Republicans have been using the Total Cases statistic to argue that blue states have a worse response to this pandemic than red states.
This video beautifully explains why changes in New Cases is the most relevant statistic if we want to talk about a given government's response to this pandemic. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Two months later, and I'm still checking this graph on a daily basis. I've noticed that rather than a flat or smooth curve, my state's version of "leveling out" is a series of dips where the weekly infection rate is between 500 to 600 new cases, and peaks where it's in the upper 700's. That made me wonder: since going out to restock my fridge / pantry is unavoidable, is it safer to go out during a dip or a peak? Are there any epidemiologists who've worked this out with previous infectious diseases? </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 1> Even cov 19 it self got bored hearing and waitting for this alleged vaccine news . </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Theres no need for vaccines. Better do Ozone Therapy as prevention and do not beliefe the lies spread by wiki or so, cause they are all puppets of big pharma.

Take a look at RobertRowenMD, watch ALL Videos there, and You will know the TRUTH </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> hablas español? </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Monkey experiments are of essential importance. Because you can't use virus to challenge the vaccinated people, it's better to do it on monkeys first. Now none of the vaccine candidates shows promising results on this aspect. 
Antibodies in your system help you to response to virus quicker. No result shows that if you are infected once, you are immune to COVID19 </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Keep up your working, we are so proud of your all people science. The world hope for all science to save the world and with jesus christ the son of God. Amen </COMMENT 5>

<COMMENT 9> Good deed to help will never be unnoticed,,, God Bless you all </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> We CAN’T CURE AIDS, or even the common cold (another Coronavirus), and yet, we’re all eagerly waiting for a CCP VIRUS vaccine that may never come. My money is on ANTIBODY treatments, especially since sick patients may not have the time to benefit from a vaccine stimulating an immune response before the patient dies. Antibody injection SKIPS the “immune response” latency period.
Oh, and I have ZERO CONFIDENCE in the WHO, also known as CHINA’S LAPDOG, to be looking out for the “best interests of the world” at this point. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> I heard that "Haste makes Waste." So rushing to create a vaccine to a virus that isn't even naturally viral to humans is retarded and a waste of our current finances. </COMMENT 11>

<COMMENT 1> 27:03 "this is part of the cost of globalization" truest words ever spoke. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Peter Covid19 is real but very far from being a pandemic. Check the death Data. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> I thank you for asking the hard questions. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Good to hear two sensible, knowledeable people discussing this. Thank you. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Swedish scientist has said the same. 50 to 60 percent of US population will get it. Lots of had already. And haven't known it. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> No hype, no proclamations, no hyperbole, no agenda. Wonderful video, thanks. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> This is comparing apple to oranges. Nobody has done statistical analysis of the seasonal flu anti-body. The symptoms of COVID19 are much worst than the flu. What can be measure is number of people who must be hospitalized and, out of those, how many die. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> So we have an illness that, even the gentlemen here agree, we have no idea how lethal it is. Rather than take precautionary measures - what the governments have been doing worldwide - they go about questioning it and the impact on economy! Yes economies have suffered, yes people have lost their jobs, but in the absence of lockdowns these could be far worse. Rather have my life than the economy booming and me resting under 6 feet of dirt! </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Thank you for being scientifically honest and not ideologically driven mixed in with fear. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Spot on. Dr Jay certainly hits the mark of what most intelligent people are thinking. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Thank you for honest, intelligent insights/perspectives. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Very interesting discussion. Thank you. But I don't think I'd like to be in the US right now at all. I live in Switzerland and am grateful every day for being here, where the health care is excellent, the laws are functional but not draconian and the whole issue has never become some political controversy polarising the entire nation. It's been dealt with practically and in a manner that the vast majority of the country supports. It's called living in a democracy, and that has not been significantly undermined in this entire process. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Please do some research on Dr Fauchi.  He's on the side of Bill Gates.  He predicted this pandemic a few years ago.  I believe President Trump knows already. And, check out Dr. Raschid Buttar on YouTube. He knows all about covid-19. They are lying a out the figures.
I also heard that if you were vaccinated with the flu shot, n tested for covid, you will test positive.
I hope this helps yall. Thanks for the info. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> The truth is here for everyone to see now. Dr Rashed A Batter has been exposing the lies to covid 19 a must see on the truth. Thank you for this video, you to have questions like us, appreciate that you guys are honest.✋ </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> This video is the most informative piece I have seen - thank you so much for showing this = to both of you...
ALL should watch the follow up Video as well..
I am pretty certain I had COVID in December and did not get tested at that time.  I was buying items from China DIRECT = person to person with a 9 day transit time.  I do believe I had it...  yes, I do... 

I would be more than willing to give plasma to someone that is sick.. however, it seems like a person that "think" they may have had it needs to have proof-positive before they can get considered to donate.. </COMMENT 15>

<COMMENT 2> USA - Our IDIOTS Dr. Fraudchi and Birx told the CDC to record ALL deaths of "Flu like symptoms" as COVID....that IS NOT SCIENCE. A guy in Chicago shot his girlfriend and himself because he thought they had COVID, neither did but it was recorded as Covid DEATHS. A guy in Oregon was hit by a bus, listed as a Covid death. </COMMENT 2>

<COMMENT 4> did you track it;

<COMMENT 5> I think this is a load of old crap. 
Another government control scheme. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> You will find in the link below the animation i made on the Covid-19 : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE5P6wMWIdg </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> The best way to prevent infection is to avoid being exposed. COVID-19 spreads from person to person, and can be spread by those who are infected but don't display symptoms. The CDC advises washing hands, avoiding close contact with others, and cleaning and disinfecting surfaces. Older adults and those with underlying chronic medical conditions should take extra precautions.

The CDC recommends use of non-medical, cloth-based face coverings in some public settings. Medical masks should be reserved for healthcare workers. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Since covid-19 is exosomes, everyone can test positive. Im very sick of all this bs. Its getting harder and harder to swallow and next time i go out around you nailbiting idiots i might throw up on you. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Nature, I suggest you take down this video. It is very much misinformation and does not add anything to progress the scientific knowledge.

We all know why you posted this...$$$$. You returned a favor for your acquaintance to get recognition so his/her at home antibody testing kits can get investors to pitch in. Very sad. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> It is just like HIV testing kits. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Do you have some vitamins to test too? Like vitamin C, A, B, D3? And minerals, metals, Zinc , Magnesium... many doctors say it's good for our immune system? </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> This reassuring to see the level of progress that UK has made for antiubody testing. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> @nature video..... can you make one video on how the protestors aren't getting sick in Amerika???! thx and keep up the good work </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Hmm. Based on statistics (current low prevalence in the community), I'd anticipate that most positive results will be false positives, and most negative results will be true negatives. Worth developing, but not particularly reassuring. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> A good news. Authorities deliver them free I must suppose. How much reliable or accurate? </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> There is any pdf of that nhs manual available online? </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> There are so many uncertainties that ought to be resolved. For one: Every country is counting the amount of infected and the amount of deaths according to different criteria, be it for political reasons or other. The amount of testing and the quality of the available tests is variable as well. To get all countries come to an agreement on these issues and act accordingly seems next to impossible to me. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> One thing I don't really get is the following: the antibody that is being is being tested for is said to come up with many diseases and is relatively long term. So I would expect a LOT of false positives, right? So many that it sounds almost unusable... Please correct me </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Keep up with the diversity hires and I'm sure you'll get there soon. </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 3> MYSTERY VIRUS: What's killing, hospitalizing residents at Greenspring retirement center?
by Tim Barber/ABC7  Friday, July 12th 2019
SPRINGFIELD, Va. (WJLA) — The SYMPTOMS USUALLY START WITH A COUGH.
In LESS THAN 2 WEEKS, a MYSTERY VIRUS at Springfield’s Greenspring Retirement Community has gotten 55 residents sick. Twenty have been hospitalized -- some with PNEUMONIA -- and two people have died.
Dr. Benjamin Schwartz is the director of epidemiology at the Fairfax County Health Department. He says the county has seen similar OUTBREAKS BUT THEY'RE USUALLY INFLUENZA IN THE WINTER.
“Our most important concern right now is ensuring the safety of other residents who are there,” said Dr. Schwartz.
The OUTBREAK has only been reported in the assisted living and skilled nursing facilities, but the retirement center’s management is still telling residents visitation is suspended until further notice, and no Garden Ridge residents, healthy or sick, should leave their respective neighborhoods.
Dr. Schwartz says the community is taking proper steps and thoroughly cleaning the facility while Inova Health and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention work to figure out what kind of a VIRUS this is and how it is spreading.
“THESE PANELS HAVE LOOKED FOR SEVERAL OF THE MOST COMMON PATHOGENS AND THEY HAVE BEEN NEGATIVE SO FAR," said Dr. Schwartz.

So, do not believe all of these anti-conspiracy nutcases, with their heads in the clouds, who think the world is a bed of roses and that all their little political and industrialist tin gods are squeaky clean little goody two-shoes. </COMMENT 12>

<COMMENT 18> ''is it natural or man made'' ,   ...well you're  no gonna put a filthy vaccine in my body ! period. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Of course, China already destroyed most of the evidence and silenced all people involved. Try to find some evidences now is very difficult. If China has nothing to hide, why keep the world from finding the truth since the January ? </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> I don't see any reason for conspiracy theories. Certain labs are most likely studying these kind of viruses to look out for dangerous new types. But making it intentionally seems not interesting to anyone ??? It turns against you in a blink with all that mutation going on with viruses. When you see the best scientists struggle so hard with even merely understanding all the  unexpected unpredictable effects of this virus, it's hard to imagine anyone could have the brains to make this. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 8> WHO & BBC correct their mistake that mask is effect for coronavirus.
WHO now (6/5) recommend to wear mask in public area. It is too late.
But WHO & BBC does not apologize for British victims that believed them.
Remember BBC prohibited mask advertizing on TV. 　　　　　2020-6-6	
Guilt of WHO & BBC－Ignore mask
Global scale human experimentation
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　2020-4-16
Prince Charles and Prime minister Johnson maybe dig their nose holes to clean and twist virus deeper by their finger after shake-hands. If they wear mask, they could not touch the nose and never infection. 
Why Japanese victims is 10% of EU and 1% of US? I believe MASK wearing.
　President Trump is blaming against WHO stand on Chinese side. But it is true in part. I think WHO stands on “White people side (EU)” 
Opinion leading of WHO is established by European people like Prime minister Johnson and BBC. Why East Asia people are smaller death than European during 2 weeks before and after 1st February? Many Chinese were spread in the world during their New Years Holiday? This was the Global scale human experimentation of “ Mask effects virus or not?” 
WHO commits even now “Mask is never useful for droplet infection for coronavirus for you. But it maybe useful that infected person give virus to the other person” This commit comes from thinking that European and American do not like mask as fashion. BBC prohibited “mask advertizing” on TV. 
Worst mistake of WHO and BBC is following their contradictory declaration:
1) Mask is only useful that infected person give virus to the other person.
2) WHO and BBC recognized COVID-19 virus of “80% infected person”   (especially younger generation) never be taken ill and cure naturally.
If this 80% fine infected person will not wear mask, they become “spreader”
This means everyone must wear the mask. 

CDC found this mistake of WHO and BBC, then CDC asked that Trump notice everybody to wear mask. But he hate mask.


First Japanese Chief Army Medical Officer Jun Matsumoto recommend mask in 1879. From this time, Japanese wear always in the flue season.  
https://gendai.ismedia.jp/articles/-/71971
　WHO recommended “hands washing” than Mask. Stupid! WHERE and WHEN can we wash hands? We rub nose under and eyes before hands washing by virus fingers in the public space. This is same activity like Prince Charles.
　When you go to toilet to wash hand and make hands clean completely, how can you stop water flowing? You must twist water cock that has many virus. You can get virus again on your clean hands. You cannot go out from toilet without grip the door knob. You cannot rub nose under without mask. NOBODY KNOW THIS FACT. Washing hands need mask indirectly.
　Major East Asia people could not understood English WHO's advice of not to wear the mask. And they went around to get mask. But European and American understood English language. And they laughed and contempt Asian mask panic. Mr. Johnson also could understood Tedros's English. WHO's this advice killed many innocent European and American. CDC corrected this miss-leading recently to ignore WHO. 
Even child can understand the conclusion of this time global scale human experimentation that “mask is useful or not” Global scale human experimentation concluded that MASK IS USEFUL TO PREVENT VIRUS.  
This time huge victims comes from WHO's miss-leading and mask dislike of white people like President Trump. I suppose this global human experimentation that mask cannot protect from flying droplet infection directly, but mask is useful and can protect against contacting infection by virus hand INDIRECTLY. Everybody always rubbed their nose under and eyes by virus finger. Mask can prevents virus transfer from virus fingers to nose under and glasses prevent from virus finger to eyes INDIRECTLY.
I never got flying droplet infection directly in this year in the public space. How many times did you get flying droplet infection directly in this year? But I rubbed nose and eyes always. We Japanese must appreciate victims of European and American at this global human experimentation. 
　WHO also must commit and apology for European and American victims that “ Mask cannot protect from flying droplet infection, but mask and glasses can protect of contact transfer of virus from virus hands INDIRECTLY” AND “WHO will agree the conclusion of mask effect from the death difference between East Asia people and European-American. WHO will apology to European and American victims. Once go out of home, wear the mask till go back to home”
 I wonder this virus acts in southern hemisphere area where is warm and counter season of northern hemisphere. This means this virus act four seasons? We must wear mask in summer?
Now we must wait 2nd and 3rd waves of virus. US people visit market without mask. I hope they will not rub nose and eyes.

<COMMENT 12> What I would like to know is when are people allowed out on ventilators ! When will people who are at home allowed to come out of prison because 5 months some have been locked up and if your bringing in new ways of going out Boris does this mean that we can take our loved ones who are completely ventilated living at home out, if so where can the people go, can they have family around to their homes can they now see their brothers & sisters grandchildren and more Boris. Please give guidelines on what to do with our loved ones on ventilators already because they live in institutions in some cases already and have limited people in their lives also and we need now to unlock these people to be able to see at least family even if it’s in N95 to protect but they need N95 and more equipment for them so they also can stay safe and go to a park or a picnic Boris so please can you look at the most vulnerable also it’s not really fair. Please help for the mental health on the staff that look after such special people who live on ventilators daily & well-being. </COMMENT 12>

<COMMENT 17> 7.45 SHOCKING - UNBELIEVABLY SHOCKING.  Boris is calling for the children worldwide for vaccines including polio, even after it had been found that the vaccine causes more polio than the disease does naturally.  Bill Gates has caused harm to 496,0000 indian children with his polio vaccine.  Does Boris really realise what he is saying?  The vaccine makers have been immunity from prosecution, even though they know it's not safe.    https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=496+000+children+paralyzed+in+india&docid=607990025394717279&mid=8EE1A67B55C9E51FAB268EE1A67B55C9E51FAB26&view=detail&FORM=VIRE </COMMENT 17>

<COMMENT 1> Even cov 19 it self got bored hearing and waitting for this alleged vaccine news . </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Theres no need for vaccines. Better do Ozone Therapy as prevention and do not beliefe the lies spread by wiki or so, cause they are all puppets of big pharma.

Take a look at RobertRowenMD, watch ALL Videos there, and You will know the TRUTH </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> hablas español? </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Monkey experiments are of essential importance. Because you can't use virus to challenge the vaccinated people, it's better to do it on monkeys first. Now none of the vaccine candidates shows promising results on this aspect. 
Antibodies in your system help you to response to virus quicker. No result shows that if you are infected once, you are immune to COVID19 </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Keep up your working, we are so proud of your all people science. The world hope for all science to save the world and with jesus christ the son of God. Amen </COMMENT 5>

<COMMENT 9> Good deed to help will never be unnoticed,,, God Bless you all </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> We CAN’T CURE AIDS, or even the common cold (another Coronavirus), and yet, we’re all eagerly waiting for a CCP VIRUS vaccine that may never come. My money is on ANTIBODY treatments, especially since sick patients may not have the time to benefit from a vaccine stimulating an immune response before the patient dies. Antibody injection SKIPS the “immune response” latency period.
Oh, and I have ZERO CONFIDENCE in the WHO, also known as CHINA’S LAPDOG, to be looking out for the “best interests of the world” at this point. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> I heard that "Haste makes Waste." So rushing to create a vaccine to a virus that isn't even naturally viral to humans is retarded and a waste of our current finances. </COMMENT 11>

<COMMENT 1> 27:03 "this is part of the cost of globalization" truest words ever spoke. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Peter Covid19 is real but very far from being a pandemic. Check the death Data. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> I thank you for asking the hard questions. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Good to hear two sensible, knowledeable people discussing this. Thank you. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Swedish scientist has said the same. 50 to 60 percent of US population will get it. Lots of had already. And haven't known it. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> No hype, no proclamations, no hyperbole, no agenda. Wonderful video, thanks. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> This is comparing apple to oranges. Nobody has done statistical analysis of the seasonal flu anti-body. The symptoms of COVID19 are much worst than the flu. What can be measure is number of people who must be hospitalized and, out of those, how many die. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> So we have an illness that, even the gentlemen here agree, we have no idea how lethal it is. Rather than take precautionary measures - what the governments have been doing worldwide - they go about questioning it and the impact on economy! Yes economies have suffered, yes people have lost their jobs, but in the absence of lockdowns these could be far worse. Rather have my life than the economy booming and me resting under 6 feet of dirt! </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Thank you for being scientifically honest and not ideologically driven mixed in with fear. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Spot on. Dr Jay certainly hits the mark of what most intelligent people are thinking. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Thank you for honest, intelligent insights/perspectives. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Very interesting discussion. Thank you. But I don't think I'd like to be in the US right now at all. I live in Switzerland and am grateful every day for being here, where the health care is excellent, the laws are functional but not draconian and the whole issue has never become some political controversy polarising the entire nation. It's been dealt with practically and in a manner that the vast majority of the country supports. It's called living in a democracy, and that has not been significantly undermined in this entire process. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Please do some research on Dr Fauchi.  He's on the side of Bill Gates.  He predicted this pandemic a few years ago.  I believe President Trump knows already. And, check out Dr. Raschid Buttar on YouTube. He knows all about covid-19. They are lying a out the figures.
I also heard that if you were vaccinated with the flu shot, n tested for covid, you will test positive.
I hope this helps yall. Thanks for the info. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> The truth is here for everyone to see now. Dr Rashed A Batter has been exposing the lies to covid 19 a must see on the truth. Thank you for this video, you to have questions like us, appreciate that you guys are honest.✋ </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> This video is the most informative piece I have seen - thank you so much for showing this = to both of you...
ALL should watch the follow up Video as well..
I am pretty certain I had COVID in December and did not get tested at that time.  I was buying items from China DIRECT = person to person with a 9 day transit time.  I do believe I had it...  yes, I do... 

I would be more than willing to give plasma to someone that is sick.. however, it seems like a person that "think" they may have had it needs to have proof-positive before they can get considered to donate.. </COMMENT 15>

<COMMENT 18> This is one of the best discussion that I have heard.  Thank you.  I have a scientific training and am shocked at how little the intelligentsia know about science in the 21st century.  We need a better basic science education </COMMENT 18>

<COMMENT 3> MYSTERY VIRUS: What's killing, hospitalizing residents at Greenspring retirement center?
by Tim Barber/ABC7  Friday, July 12th 2019
SPRINGFIELD, Va. (WJLA) — The SYMPTOMS USUALLY START WITH A COUGH.
In LESS THAN 2 WEEKS, a MYSTERY VIRUS at Springfield’s Greenspring Retirement Community has gotten 55 residents sick. Twenty have been hospitalized -- some with PNEUMONIA -- and two people have died.
Dr. Benjamin Schwartz is the director of epidemiology at the Fairfax County Health Department. He says the county has seen similar OUTBREAKS BUT THEY'RE USUALLY INFLUENZA IN THE WINTER.
“Our most important concern right now is ensuring the safety of other residents who are there,” said Dr. Schwartz.
The OUTBREAK has only been reported in the assisted living and skilled nursing facilities, but the retirement center’s management is still telling residents visitation is suspended until further notice, and no Garden Ridge residents, healthy or sick, should leave their respective neighborhoods.
Dr. Schwartz says the community is taking proper steps and thoroughly cleaning the facility while Inova Health and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention work to figure out what kind of a VIRUS this is and how it is spreading.
“THESE PANELS HAVE LOOKED FOR SEVERAL OF THE MOST COMMON PATHOGENS AND THEY HAVE BEEN NEGATIVE SO FAR," said Dr. Schwartz.

<COMMENT 19> Of course, China already destroyed most of the evidence and silenced all people involved. Try to find some evidences now is very difficult. If China has nothing to hide, why keep the world from finding the truth since the January ? </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> I don't see any reason for conspiracy theories. Certain labs are most likely studying these kind of viruses to look out for dangerous new types. But making it intentionally seems not interesting to anyone ??? It turns against you in a blink with all that mutation going on with viruses. When you see the best scientists struggle so hard with even merely understanding all the  unexpected unpredictable effects of this virus, it's hard to imagine anyone could have the brains to make this. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 3> MYSTERY VIRUS: What's killing, hospitalizing residents at Greenspring retirement center?
by Tim Barber/ABC7  Friday, July 12th 2019
SPRINGFIELD, Va. (WJLA) — The SYMPTOMS USUALLY START WITH A COUGH.
In LESS THAN 2 WEEKS, a MYSTERY VIRUS at Springfield’s Greenspring Retirement Community has gotten 55 residents sick. Twenty have been hospitalized -- some with PNEUMONIA -- and two people have died.
Dr. Benjamin Schwartz is the director of epidemiology at the Fairfax County Health Department. He says the county has seen similar OUTBREAKS BUT THEY'RE USUALLY INFLUENZA IN THE WINTER.
“Our most important concern right now is ensuring the safety of other residents who are there,” said Dr. Schwartz.
The OUTBREAK has only been reported in the assisted living and skilled nursing facilities, but the retirement center’s management is still telling residents visitation is suspended until further notice, and no Garden Ridge residents, healthy or sick, should leave their respective neighborhoods.
Dr. Schwartz says the community is taking proper steps and thoroughly cleaning the facility while Inova Health and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention work to figure out what kind of a VIRUS this is and how it is spreading.
“THESE PANELS HAVE LOOKED FOR SEVERAL OF THE MOST COMMON PATHOGENS AND THEY HAVE BEEN NEGATIVE SO FAR," said Dr. Schwartz.

<COMMENT 12> Well, the general is wrong. Luc Montagnier, the Nobel Prize winner who discovered HIV, announced that COVID-19 is a partially man-made virus. ...

<COMMENT 18> ''is it natural or man made'' ,   ...well you're  no gonna put a filthy vaccine in my body ! period. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Of course, China already destroyed most of the evidence and silenced all people involved. Try to find some evidences now is very difficult. If China has nothing to hide, why keep the world from finding the truth since the January ? </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> I don't see any reason for conspiracy theories. Certain labs are most likely studying these kind of viruses to look out for dangerous new types. But making it intentionally seems not interesting to anyone ??? It turns against you in a blink with all that mutation going on with viruses. When you see the best scientists struggle so hard with even merely understanding all the  unexpected unpredictable effects of this virus, it's hard to imagine anyone could have the brains to make this. </COMMENT 20>

<DESCRIPTION> America's covid-19 death toll is higher than anywhere else in the world—and is continuing to mount. What's behind the country's coronavirus pandemic failings? </DESCRIPTION>

<COMMENT 1> What do you want to know about the ongoing coronavirus pandemic? Comment below with any questions you have about Covid-19 and about the economic impact and recovery in the months and years ahead. Our resident coronavirus expert alongside one of The Economist's financial journalists will answer as many questions as possible in two films we’ll publish on 5th and 8th May. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> For an accurate assesment,  shouldn't we control for population size?
How is the USA's Case-fatality rate lower than France, Italy, UK, Mexico, Sweden, Ecuador, Canada, Indonesia? Why is our death rate/ 100,000 lower than UK, Italy, Sweden? </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> This is a joke and full of lies. Jan 30 WHO advised that the virus was in fact human to human transmitted. Jan 31 Trump signed an order restricting flights from China and other countries with COVID outbreak. CDC was staged at 5 Int’l airports. Meanwhile, Trump was called a xenophobere for the first actions. Trump warned of the virus in Feb during the SOTUA but Nancy Pelosi called the speech a manifesto of lies. If you look it up the orders signed into action nearly daily steps to battle or prepare for virus. Funny that the virus seems to have cured diabetes, renal failure, pneumonia, heart issues because all the numbers in those are down due to COVID. Majority is over the age of 70 and had 1 -  3 other underlying conditions. If people continues to believe this bs then you are fooled by people that only want to control you and see you dumb enough to not question their info and believe anything they say is true. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Well , people in 2020 are still living as though they were in 1918 pandemic when  675,000 Americans  died . The Covid 19 in this pandemic have so far claimed  111,000 fatalities and counting ..... </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Us Americans need real discipline to stay home because no one is taking this coronavirus thing serious the US has the most deaths when will you take things seriously! </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Come on Economist, you cannot be more biased in this 'reporting'. The Economist blames the conservative for their slow response but so far, most of the death occurred in DEMOCRAT CITIES and DEMOCRAT GOVERNOR. Mind commenting on that? </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Its not because of the president.. It is because of the people of america.. They dont care about lockdown or others, not to mention social distancing, just think of freedom and enjoying life and thats what they get, president in the whole world are not responsible for the spread of this virus, it is the dicipline of the people. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Stop blaming and pointing finger.. Whoever the president it will be the same.. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> sound like american ppl want wild free in them country corona for everyone when brian is not so smart when speak lol </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> This is my only problem with the Republicans, they are way too cautious and slow to act in many areas. And my only problem with the Democrats is that they politicized everything and instigate partisan politics. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> UK 587 deaths per million  number 2 I. World </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> It's all china's fault.. With the help of the democrats of course </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> They never understand this: orang sana memang nak mati kata kawan saya. Minta maaf ya kalau sakit hati😂😂😂😂 </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> 50% of the deaths are in: New York,  New Jersey , Massachusetts, Illinois and Michigan states...    would be interested if you check the governors actions on these states... </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> it's all Trump's work . trump is vile ! </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Trump: "We will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN"

Oh yeah? You DID. CONGRATULATIONS! GREAT PANDEMIC SPREAD

Trump: "........China's beating us"

Oh yeah? Don't worry you WILL BEAT them SOON! AS THE COUNTRY THAT HAS MOST DEATHS OF COVID19 IN THE WORLD that is. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> The numbers in the United States is half of what has been posted. The hospitals are almost empty and nurses and doctors are being laid off. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> *This is why Trump won. I am a liberal and always will be, but these students are the new face of the democratic party When the "progressives" are discriminating based on race and fighting against free speech I simply cannot support it* </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Because it’s a large country and the CCP and WHO withheld information on the virus perhaps? </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Almost higher than the rest of the world combined including third world nations. When you scare the world you have to lead the world. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 12> Your the one behind it. Your foundation gave all the statistics . It was your scientist come with all the  facts of how you how works </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> The people who were alive during the 1918 Spanish Flu outbreak said that the only people to get it were the ones who took vaccines because they were told that soldiers were coming home with infectious diseases. The vaccines caused the people to be sick and the  illness was labelled as Spanish Flu to cover the real cause. The unvaccinated didn’t get it even though they were taking care of the sick.

The people who are sick now with flu-like symptoms are the ones who took the flu vaccine. That’s why they are sick. Refuse to take any vaccine. They are slow kill weapons. Bill Gates should be put in prison for the rest of his life. Alternatively he should be put into an institution for the criminally insane. What he is trying to do is worse than Hitler did. His stated aim is “to create a healthy market for vaccines.” This is one reason for this false pandemic. The other reason is depopulation.

We have inalienable human rights under Common Law. Also under the Nuremberg Code which is Article 7 of the United Nations' International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and is the basis for International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects proposed by the World Health Organisation.

They cannot make anyone take any vaccine. It has to be voluntary, otherwise it is coercion.

See here: The ten points of the Nuremberg Code

The ten points of the code were given in the section of the verdict entitled "Permissible Medical Experiments”

“The voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential.
The experiment should be such as to yield fruitful results for the good of society, unprocurable by other methods or means of study, and not random and unnecessary in nature.
The experiment should be so designed and based on the results of animal experimentation and a knowledge of the natural history of the disease or other problem under study that the anticipated results will justify the performance of the experiment.
The experiment should be so conducted as to avoid all unnecessary physical and mental suffering and injury.
No experiment should be conducted where there is an a priori reason to believe that death or disabling injury will occur; except, perhaps, in those experiments where the experimental physicians also serve as subjects.
The degree of risk to be taken should never exceed that determined by the humanitarian importance of the problem to be solved by the experiment.
Proper preparations should be made and adequate facilities provided to protect the experimental subject against even remote possibilities of injury, disability, or death.
The experiment should be conducted only by scientifically qualified persons. The highest degree of skill and care should be required through all stages of the experiment of those who conduct or engage in the experiment.
During the course of the experiment the human subject should be at liberty to bring the experiment to an end if he has reached the physical or mental state where continuation of the experiment seems to him to be impossible.
During the course of the experiment the scientist in charge must be prepared to terminate the experiment at any stage, if he has probable cause to believe, in the exercise of the good faith, superior skill and careful judgment required of him that a continuation of the experiment is likely to result in injury, disability, or death to the experimental subject.”

Anyone who thinks that vaccines are safe and effective should take a look at vaccine package inserts. 

Here is one https://www.naturalnews.com/images/Flulaval-Influenza-Vaccine-Insert-600.jpg

Here is another one. This is the MMR vaccine: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B7vHq9RIAAIp5sV.jpg

And another: https://odiariodeumet.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/adacel1.png?w=640

By listing the side effects that have been reported, the manufacturer is telling you that it is NOT SAFE and that you take it AT YOUR OWN RISK!

No vaccine has ever been shown to be safe and is therefore a medical experiment. They cannot make anyone take it. Stand up for your rights. Say No! </COMMENT 13>

<COMMENT 1> The Cuomo brothers, Andrew and Chris, Dumb and Dumber.
Dumb is also known as Chris. His job is to misinform the American public every day on fake news CNN
. Dumber, Andrew. Better known as  Criminal Cuomo. His intent is to destroy the state of NY.
Highest taxes in the country, no guns, no fracking, no jobs, and if he had is way, no prisons and we would have illegals living in our homes.
According to him and I quote this idiot...  “America was never that great anyway.” </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Chris Como you're a pussy </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> the stats are abundantly clear : if you are not 70 or greater in a nursing home or hospice  with dementia , heart and kidney failure or  end stage cancer you have little to fear except fear itself. Despite the media hysterics and very misleading misrepresentations for the vast majority its no bigger threat than the seasonal flu. All this lockdown BS is completely unverified pulled out the ass BS to appease the ignorant and cowardly . </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> I wonder if that's why Fredo felt good enough to go look at his house during the daytime and yell at a biker. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Has this clown addressed how he got busted outside looking at a house with a crowd of people while NOT WEARING A MASK???? </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Hey, forgedda about it. CNN drew straws and he lost? No he won? A symptomatic fake! </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> FAKE NEWS PHONIES </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Cuomo's Covid-19 infection was about as real as his 100 pound dumbbells. Everything about Fredo here is fake. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Well let me be honest and straightforward to you and your brother. Both are a joke. your brothers decision about the covid with how he handled the situation was so bad killed so many people and i know all about it. 
the president helps New York so much out and you trash him. Shame on you .... 

grow up don’t sell your sol. 
all you do is trolling Trump we got it you’re not on his side.
you work for CNN we all know it’s a fake news it’s a bought  out news 
fake you guys are not real people you’re not the man that wears the pants at your house because your fake. Real man real father they won’t lie and be fake like both of you. 
Sick and tired of you. 
Take the red pill 🌹 jerk 
Look at the mirror every morning and say it to yourself 
I sold my sol and i am a fake person. 
It’s a freedom of speech right the way you do 
That is the way i do. 
Take it or leave it

<COMMENT 12> Cuomo Bothers; one a Steroid Raging Psychopath Alcoholic and one a Nursing Home Killer! </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Is anyone else baffled that CNN doesn't close down their comment sections? Don't get me wrong, I'm glad they don't-- they would experience massive backlash ala STREISAND EFFECT if they tried. But it seems like a bitch move they would attempt, lol. Especially when everyone is calling Cuomo out for faking his illness. "The beast comes at night" oh please. </COMMENT 13>

<COMMENT 15> CCN is a propaganda/ lie mill. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Damn he’s still alive </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Lol CNN aka Certainly Not News, fredo was out with his Mrs but CNN says he's been in a basement........ which I agree with he should be in a basement and preferably locked in there so his viewers can gain try to gain some IQ and I'm from Africa so no political dog I  this fight. Just calling bullshit when I see it, be offended if you want....... we all know how much you love being offended 😂😂😂 </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> This piece of shit!!! Lmao 😂 just can’t quit lying about everything. Out checking on his big house being built. No mask with his kids!               FAKE NEWS NETWORK </COMMENT 18>

<COMMENT 1> I love how she says we don’t have the technology to microchip people xD </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> I have heard from a few sources that the US Army believes they will have some type of vaccine by the end of 2020.    Anyone else have any information on that?   I’m from a military family  but none of us are Doctors or researchers.  My son is active duty with 2 deployments and now  JAG attorney.    No experts on this in my family. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Wow.  A channel with a smart and educated audience.  Aka not too many red state Fox fed trump,twats </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Excellent content. I’ve been researching this virus and I’m really looking forward to results of the many rct’s. To me, Tocilizumab and Convalescent Plasma Transfusion seem like the more effective treatments out there, but I have only recently realized the extent of endothelial involvement </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57CSfTR34d0 </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> I have a question.  Why can't you just test say people entering the country instead of quarantine them.  So if they don't test positive then let them go? </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Dr Seheult, you are also our hero. Thank you for educating us (healthcare).. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Marvelous. I will be listening again. It was very comprehensive. So much good information to help me to help myself. I had a lot of blood vessel damage during  brain surgery, twice
Just glad that you Explained how that works thank you. I'd like to know how it affects someone whose eyes are weak do to a brain tumor. And how the virus affects the brain.
Thank you so much for your presentation it's exactly what I was looking for. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> There's a lot of big words that someone who doesn't know all the words could miss chunks of meaning from this video... Thrombosis is the thing I am most unsure about, I do know of deep vein thrombosis so assumed that section of the video was saying a lot of people with covid19 will have plaque forming inside their veins because that's what happens with deep vein thrombosis.

The picture with the fat man and the skinny man was very easy to understand but It does make it look worse for fat people than in reality. If skinny people still get struck down by covid19 then as a fat person I sure feel like I don't need to panic and start running down the hallway and spam into the wall...

I like that you guys know what minor tweaks could be done to improve a person's chances like which vitamins they should be having and hot cold treatment however can a patient be sure that no matter which medical hospital they go to in the world that those doctors will also care and know this? Also how many saunas are in hospitals to be able to try hot cold? Should everyone be trying hot cold for the common cold or flu? Seems to me like hot cold seems to be a general treatment that's good like how it's good for a person to be face down to improve their breathing when there's phlegm. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> One question 
As far as I understand nobody have isolated Covid19 Virus. 
Is the Good Dr talking about Covid in general ? </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Lose weight. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Great initiative by MedCram team👌 </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> See why we should END WAGE SLAVERY? See now? It’s insane because no one can work for 2-4-24 months or TEN YEARS ++? See? </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> As someone that knows Nothing about Molecular Biology or Medicine, and being frustrated by the widespread superficiality of media presentations and details I was very intrigued and interested to hear you speak on the virus, and the medicinal practices and details associated with it. I feel I have a greatly improved framework to understand what is going on around me that has caused the globe to come to a violent halt. I appreciate your time and look forward to more of your videos, thanks for your expertise and introducing me to a new world of ideas, terms and in-depth perspective. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> *STUPID QUESTION: DO ANTIHISTAMINES SUPPRESS INNATE IMMUNITY?*
It's spring and I cannot function without antihistamines.  This year, Diphenhydramine, is my preferred solution because the once a day pills don't carry me beyond 5 hours.  
I only need these from Feb through July. Am I (male 53 with no other comorbidity) at a potentially increased risk? </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> https://www.deccanherald.com/science-and-environment/zinc-hydroxychloroquine-found-effective-in-some-covid-19-patients-study-836561.html spread the word trump might be right! </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> The PROBLEM with the VA study: The one's who got the drug were further along on the virus than the one's who didn't. In other words they were much sicker. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> @MedCram, why were several of your COVID lessons removed?  You provide great, objective information. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Great hosting lol from Ireland </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Chinese Authorities Admits  cover up

<COMMENT 1> *Good voice 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👏🏻!* </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> During this whole ordeal more people died from the virus in Montréal than in the entirety of Japan. Sasuga Nippon! </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Let's be honest.... the way Japan handled the pandemic situation was NOT GOOD. The numbers aren't reliable (due to reluctance to test early on and low testing capacity), the cloth masks do not properly cover the nose and mouth for many people, medical staff do not have enough protective equipment, and there was no proper lockdown because many work places did not have the technology enabled.
It seems like Japan is returning back to normal and that's out of pure dumb luck or due to lack of testing to know the true numbers of infected people. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> 26:38 this is a pen
this is a pen
this is a pineapple
uhhhh 
pineapple pen 😅 </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> What you didn't understand is that by claiming that the virus is more easily transmitted when you speak English is that is an indirect  way to discriminate English speakers, therefore foreigners. Think!! </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> As I saw from this video, the Tokyo Governor did the job better than Japanese PM. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Thank you for the informative video. I'll definitely check back if you do a follow up. Over here in Canada it's difficult to predict when our state of emergency will be lifted. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> I hope you and your family are safe Greg! Stay safe bud. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Thanks 🙏
Great content! </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> wait near the beginning of the video why is it that japanese are buying chinese toilet paper? What is that article? I'm very interested in whatever relevance they might have found </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> This scamdemic needs to enddddddddd. The virus is fake. The PCR test is fraud. The death certificates are misleading. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> That's a weird way to say "This is a pen" </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Trump should have his eyelids propped open with toothpicks and be made to watch this video . . . not that it do any good.. Good work. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Thank you so much for putting this timeline together, not just for us watching and living through COID-19, but for the future when we look back at this in many years' time. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Great vid!! Gorgeous closing shot. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Thank you! </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> *The clips you played made me uncomfortable....lol* </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> It’s not the amount of food eaten, it’s the inability to go out to get food... or trying to stretch the times between grocery shopping. Also, watching with subtitles is always entertaining. I applaud the cutting of lawmakers salary during the emergency. Wish the US would do the same.... </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> legit this has really been the worse year - including the sad stuff in the video
1.) Killing Qasem Soleimani - caused an uproar 
2.) ww3 trending
3.) plane shot down, many innocent Canadians killed   
4.) corona virus 
5.) death of George Floyd 
wonder what is next </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> That's what I love about Japan vs the us. Japan can just ask nicely and social conscience will do the rest, meanwhile in the us we have hoarding and folks acting like they're being held prisoner in their homes.
Glad you all are healthy and doing well </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 9> Le confinement a du sens à la seule et unique condition que pendant cette période, l’état augmente considérablement les capacités des hôpitaux quitte à créer des hôpitaux de campagne par régions. Le déconfinement pourra alors être fait au niveau national pour que les gens s’auto -immunisent et ceux qui ne réussiront pas à s’auto-immuniser, les hôpitaux seront alors structurés et prêts à les recevoir en nombre.
Si les moyens des hôpitaux ne sont pas augmentés, les contagions reprendront de plus belle car il n’y a aucune raison que le virus s’arrête par enchantement.
Mettons-nous au travail pour construire ces hôpitaux de campagne. Les citoyens seront volontaires pour apporter leur aides. </COMMENT 9>

*Très malhonnête, pourtant il suffit de faire la somme des chiffres présentés ici même pour voir que la France a plus de morts qu'aux États-Unis, soit disant "pays le plus touché au monde"...*

*Facile de se croire moins touché, il suffit de moins tester ! Voilà pourquoi les seules comparaisons sérieuses doivent porter sur les morts, plus durs à cacher, quoique la France se débrouille pas mal avec les morts des EHPAD  sous le tapis...* </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> *4 503 décès à l'hôpital + 884 en EHPAD ça fait 5 387 morts en France, plus que les  5148 décès aux États-Unis ! POURQUOI MENT IL ? LA FRANCE EST NUMÉRO 3 MONDIAL EN TERME DE DÉCÈS AU COVID 19 !* </COMMENT 16>

<COMMENT 7> <COVID-19 TRUTH>
*Most people won’t get the virus.*
*Most of the people who get it won’t display symptoms.*
*Most of the people who display symptoms will only be mildly sick.*
*Most of the people with severe symptoms will never be critically ill.*
*And most of the people who get critically ill will survive.*

This is borne out by the numerous serological studies which show, again and again, that the infection fatality ratio is on par with flu.
( https://swprs.org/studies-on-covid-19-lethality/ )
There is no science – and increasingly little rational discussion – to justify the lockdown measures and overall sense of global panic.
Nevertheless, it’s always good to get official acknowledgement of the truth, even if it has to be leaked.
Here are three leaks showing that those in power know that the coronavirus poses no threat, and in no way justifies the lockdown that is going to destroy the livelihoods of so many.
1. “IT’S ALL BULLSHIT!”
On May 26th Dr Alexander Myasnikov, Russia’s head of coronavirus information, gave an interview to former-Presidential candidate Ksenia Sobchak in which he apparently let slip his true feelings.
( https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/05/27/its-all-bullsht-russias-coronavirus-information-chief-says-of-virus-fears-a70398 )
Believing the interview over, and the camera turned off, Myasnikov said:
It’s all bullshit […] It’s all exaggerated. It’s an acute respiratory disease with minimal mortality […] Why has the whole world been destroyed? That I don’t know,”

<COMMENT 3> Looks like Mike Harris did it again . First to the disabled whom he dehoused and stole billions from and now to the elderly. 
If you protect such a man , with whatever reasoning, you might pay for his sins, too, on the day of judgement. I, personally, will stand witness against him.
Do not kid yourselves, Ford and Tory will protect him because he is well-connected. </COMMENT 3>

Stop corruption and the problem gets fixed with more money in the pot serving where it’s intended to go </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Fox News anchors all over this video,  judging by the comments. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> I came back here because this was the last CBC video with the comments turned on. Every one posted since has the comments turned off. You are supposed to be the national broadcaster, CBC. What is the problem with allowing active discourse on your posted videos? This is the last CBC video that I will watch. Considering the level of journalistic integrity in evidence on your news broadcasts over the last decade or so, I don’t think I’m likely to miss much. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> This is all a sham at this point. turdeau is killing the country's economy, millions of job lost, suicides, depression, businesses that will never come back etc... all of that for a virus equivalent to a bad case of seasonal flu. Numbers around the world confirm this. the WHO just confirmed that it's 10x less contagious than their prediction. (wrong since the beginning) and confirmed that a second wave is non existent. Wake up people, this was a false alarm and they knew for a while now. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> The CBC lying for their liberal masters. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> As a health care worker with reduced hours...promises of topping up our pay has still not come to pass.... entering week 12 of severe pay loss while others getting full CERB... ridiculous... </COMMENT 11>

Is there is any finencal support for Canadian after June 6 2020? </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> This is perfect. I stopped counting at 70. 70 in a row negative comments about our weasel leader and CBC.....so good to see people catching on to these leftist scammers </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> When will the CBC start asking real questions and holding this federal government accountable for all of this massive spending? Where will the money come from? How large is the current deficit with all this covid spending? How much will taxes increase? When will the frderal government stop funding the media and the CBC? </COMMENT 15>

<COMMENT 6> I don't think these guys could talk if you tied there hands behind there back </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Great presentation. One last aspect, caveat. Llama protein is ‘foreign’ to our immune system and could therefore lead to an immune response against it, similar to a human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) immune response. Could that be a HAMA - Llama? I feel I now need to add, ding dong, to the end of that! </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> ¡¡¡CUIDADO LLAMAS!!! </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Brilliant. </COMMENT 9>

<COMMENT 16> Yay, Winter!! </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Biotech blows my mind. How did researchers know they could use bacteria to produce long chain proteins? It’s fascinating. Wished sometimes I choose a career path in the medical research field. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> people actually believe llamas can help them ? 😂 </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Seems cool but impractical.  We already know how to make vaccines.  Because SARS-COV-2 doesn't kill everyone it infects, the human immune system seems adequate at dealing with it. The llama antibody treatment probably won't be ready before the ones in development are ready. </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 1> Hi guys, Quite a while ago I applied for a working holiday visa, which I obtained, including a valid working permit. Due to the evolution of Covid-19, I am obligated to get a job BEFORE entering Canada. Is there anyone who can hook me up with a job in AB? Send me an email: stefanleers@gmail </COMMENT 1>

<COMMENT 11> That is a big, fat, pile of horse puckey. Which Canadians did you ask? Trudeau's groupies or his Cabinet ministers? </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> I think it should stay closed until the end. However I think we should consider some refugees wanting to be safe. I know one person I would sponsor </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Keep it closed for 5 years and keep out immigration for 10 years </COMMENT 13>

<COMMENT 1> thanks to bbc travel show for this video clip.i, kmf haque call the whole scenario the nature's way of cautioning  people on to live i a disciplined life. people generally draw different meanings from this word '' disciplined life .what to eat, what to wear, what to drink, how to live like brothers on this planet. i could see and i am seeing that we have made this world worst than the hell. '' to i can see all countries big or small ,the who is trying its best to ease the sufferings of the world.but the third world countries need to be taught the lessons os cleanliness,tidiness . china must be monitored in their eating style. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> who even wants to travel now?it was hard enough prior,now,it would be a bloody nightmare.I don't care what they do,or invent,there is ABSOLUTELY no way to keep safe in a close environment like an airplane.Staying home. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> So if you human got some sense of wisdom joint greta thunburg save the planet movement or you will totally extinct in near future. </COMMENT 3>

<COMMENT 9> Well little did you know I can't afford to fly. HAHAHAHA </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> So you pay $15 thousand for a holiday get to the airport and your temperature is over normal .  No Holiday for you and your lose all your money . Good
Luck getting it back from travel  insurance .    Dunno how they will get around this one ? </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Air travelers = SUPER SPREADERS </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> We are such a weak society these days. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> The problem is if tickets are expensive people cant fly. People will be making a lot less money if they even have a job. In the future there will be less airlines and Leds planes. I predict  a permanent 20% increase  over the next few years  assuming countries subsidize.. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> i would take you much more seriously mate if you'd wear a mask properly, THE ENTIRE TIME -__- </COMMENT 14>

<COMMENT 19> What a load of bollocks this is.....as soon as the number of travellers progressively increase the airlines will throw caution to the wind for the sake of profits!  Just remember the old saying ‘you fly at your own risk’. </COMMENT 19>

<TITLE> COVID-19: How Did The US Get It So Wrong? </TITLE>
<URL> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltJV3IMP-Dg </URL>
<TIMESTAMP> 2020-05-13T15:53:10Z </TIMESTAMP>
<DESCRIPTION> America has the highest number of #COVID19 infections and deaths in the world. Why was its response to the global pandemic too late and too little? </DESCRIPTION>
<TAGS> ['CNA Insider', 'Channel NewsAsia', 'People stories', 'Asian perspectives'] </TAGS>
<COMMENT 1> Because China lied and the WHO got it wrong. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Batman..where are you? </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> One problem: TRUMP </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> The same way us Canadians got it so wrong,By deception.
China purposely withheld vital information while making a trade deal in bad faith with USA which included a "Deal can be cancelled in case of Act of God or pandemic" clause.
WHO assisted by insisting to all G7 countries that the social media reporting of the pandemic was fake news and there was no danger even though Wuhan locked down January 23.
For a comparison look at Canada's situation.If population is adjusted to match USA figures about 70,000 dead.
Trump,Canada's Trudeau, and Ex WHO member Canada's Dr. Tam reiterated these words and Trudeau even encouraged travel from China sick or not.
First confirmed case arrived in Canada Jan 25.Canada locked down March 18.
Watch Canada's health minister in late Febuary call it fake news during questions of "Canada is taking the WHO expert advice to not shut borders".
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3O1EBQXl6U&t=879s and at the time frame 11:40 where she says we are continuing to follow the expert advice of the WHO.

Taiwan warned WHO of a human to human transmission threat.WHO ignored Taiwan because WHO is a china puppet.
The proof of this is they will not recoganize Taiwan as anything but a part of China to avoid conflict with China.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlCYFh8U2xM          https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h43S34daX-U 

Is the WHO supposed to be political?Allegations are that a top WHO member's family accepted "help" from China.
Trump has discontinued to send the WHO $400 million a year.All G7 countries need to follow his lead.

It is time for the G7 countries to start our own version of the WHO and dump the incompetent or corrupt WHO.
They assisted China by withholding information to protect China's negotiating in bad faith trade deal by participating in an act of conspiracy to commit murder.
We as a society owe this to the families of all the murder victims. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Trump has smart people around him. He knows that. He just believes that he himself is more smart.

He isn’t. 

How do I deal with what he has done?? I will let you know after I go to the toilet. I gotta take a wicked trump. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> We're suppose to be hit the hardest yet the only place we really saw it is in New York. Many here dont take it seriously because we just aren't seeing it. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> This is war. Wake up! </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Who is suffering the worst----the politicians---the establishment---the poor----the rich!? Just asking! </COMMENT 8>

<COMMENT 10> He blames every one, to deflect from his 12 yr.old mind </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> mask need </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Why singaporean news channel covering the failing of US president? Why don't u look at your own government first? Oh wait, u're too afraid to criticize Singapore government! hahaha... </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> American leaders is at fault but they put the blame to WHO and China! They acted to too late. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Spoiled Brat it is, . . . Too much liberty realy kills, . . . We have a saying, that all that is prohibited is addictive😂😂😂😂 " liberty" </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> New York Times are FAKE NEWS. They didn't report President Trump want to stop people coming in to USA but the Democrats ignored it. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> In Taiwan, the first case was detected early and President Tsai Ing-wen immediately consulted her team of top infectious disease experts and together, using what they learned from the SARS epidemic, they initiated a sophisticated program of banning flights from Wuhan, testing, tracking, tracing and isolation and, with the cooperation of the Taiwanese people, the dragon was slain!
     And what did Trump do with his OWN team of experts? 
     He disbanded them.
     Why?
     Because they'd been assembled by Barack Obama and he didn't like that. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Don't worry America. Malaysia will keep selling you medical gloves. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Like anything else from China be it trade , "war" or whatever.... trump think it's a walk in the park .....he is half right, but the park is where they're burying the dead (american) from covid-19, they now have to find places to bury black African American inflicted by the white supremacist police ! Pse don't give any advice on how Hong Kong should be rule ! </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> 😞😞😞 We have been following this pandemic since December, when the pandemic was still in China before it broke out into Europe. By which time the government and the people here, who has families in both Europe and China, started to get worried and probably (hopefully) started discussions and pre actions in order to try and get ahead of this before it could break out here. And since this pandemic started spreading over the Christmas, New Year and Chinese New Year period, where we witness the most heaviest travel period in the world, of course it is going to break out. If Trump’s acted sooner with The Playbook and had not cut funding for Infectious Diseases Control in Asia and had he not pulled out of the Paris Accords, which by the way including medicines and equipment buying and selling, And not taken down Obamacare, which might alleviate their constituents from paying too much  on hospital and doctors bills, I very highly doubt that you would have suffered such high casualties than you already have. Look at our country Australia and look at our casualty rates. Stark contrast to yours. Mr Trump I applaud you 👏👏 very well done sir 👍 Well done. This is your legacy. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> US values politics more than lives. So it's obvious its government urge people to die to save the workable. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 10> Why exactly are there people disliking? Have they been crying too much over people with it? Hate it? Paranoid of it? Why would they dislike? </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> I'm sorry for the loss to her family and all those she's helped and could have helped in the future. That said, observe her weight. That raises the question did she take care of herself? I see zero mention of additional vitamin C, vitamin D, zinc or any kind of good diet. I have no doubt she was a wonderful woman. I do believe she was brainwashed by a standard medical instruction. It truly is up to each of us to take care of our own immune system. Maybe we have to be seen as a bit selfish and take care of ourselves, so we can take care of others for a longer period of time. May she rest in peace. </COMMENT 11>

<COMMENT 14> But continue going out to f'ing beaches, eating junk food in restaurants, and going to malls to buy sh** you don't need with money you don't have because you need other people to entertain you.  Continue thinking this is a joke and don't wear masks or gloves while your fat pig president golfs.  Hope you're enjoying the party, America.  🖕 </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Well she looks old and obese. She probably could have died from a regular flue also. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Rest In Peace </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Covid19 eventually shuts you down with pneumonia --- asphyxiation. Your lungs just shut down. And yet many people during phase 3 are walking around without face masks....

<COMMENT 1> I do not have confidence on government in controlling the virus. They failed. </COMMENT 1>

<COMMENT 7> We only hear lobsided news and views.  Mdm Christy Loh stands up for her children and yours too. But we live in fear or selfishness to avoid being in the spot light of speaking up what is truth. We should take courage like Mdm Loh  and ask the right questions. Thats being responsible not being rebellious. May the Lord protects us all. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> I feel you. I sent my son to sch with a heavy heart. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> This pandemic has shown us that we need to listen  and accommodate to diverse and dissent views to be able to do and think out of the box. If we just brow beat every idea and thought out of existence  that we don’t agree with, than we as a country will be much poorer despite our wealth . </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Govt shld just closed the school. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Take Korea as an example,  they had to shut school due to 2nd wave of Covid-19. I foresee this happening in SG too. We are not ready to open up yet </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> elections coming right? you people know what to do lah yah!! </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> There's a agenda behind all this cb, and y phase by phase, reopening. They want  all of us to mould into a concept, using psychological warfare. Misinformation and not the Truth. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> I am a Sporean live in Thailand. The Thai government ask ppl to wear mask since February. And decided to lock down the country around mid March (early then sg). Until today, Thailand community had 0 infections for the past 2 weeks. And Thai gov still don't dare to reopen the school.. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> They think they are god...they can make the virus not infect anyone.

In this day and age, education can happen anywhere as long as one is willing to put in their effort. The old industrial revolution school model is outdated. Government could not keep up with this changing economy, and yet they still want the kids to be sent to school for command and control. Education is not a place...it comes from the root word "educe", which means it comes from within.

Vote wisely guys! </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> 生命最可贵没什么比命更值钱 </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Singapore's government does not different shape from other governments around the world. Which means that most of the time it will respond already too late when a crisis has occurred. Am not defending the government or whatever but unfortunately this is typical human nature. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Is our kids so weak? How Long should we closed our school to feel it’s safe to resume (1 year or whole of kids academic period)?  Are the kids infected in school or home? </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Stay home or not stay home safe? He does not bother, Becos not his children! </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Agree with you that nothing is more precious than health and life. There should be a choice to allow parents to return their children to school. With subject-based branding, my kid actually needs to go to 3 different classrooms daily. This makes it impossible not to mingle with kids in other classes. Strange that they are telling the seniors to stay home, employees to work from home as a default in phase 1, yet making school compulsory for children. I’ve witnessed students interacting with one another after school, sometimes without masks. Social responsibility is just not there yet with all these half-hearted measures too. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 12> Vous êtes un numéro messieurs, dames (la série le prisonnier! ) </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> dimanche 5 Avril encore plus chaud , alors sortez , profitez du soleil   😝 </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Pour ce commentaire prenez un petit moment à lire 10 raisons suivantes !!! ( mes opinions personels) .

1) Si le virus vient vraiment des chauves souris et de marché d'animaux sauvages de  Wuhan (Chine)pourquoi ce virus vient juste d'apparaitre maintenant alors que le marché et bien sur les chauves souris existaient depuis longtemps avant meme que certaines personnes soient naitre 


2) Remarquez-vous ? Pourquoi le virus propage très vite dans les grands pays (pays de pouvoir ) comme (Chine, Japon ,France, Espagne,Italie ,Allemagne ou encore Etats Unis)

3) Les médias nous informent chaque jour les nombres de morts qui augmentent  comme pas possible et n'ont jamais diffusé les photos de ces cadavres (bien sur censurés je ne demande pas non plus de montrer tous les cadavres) la plupart des medias informent les informations sur le virus mais on voit que les images de docteurs,infirmierss etc qui ont été diffusé .Ok je ne dis pas le contraire car je crois aussi que le virus existe vraiment mais moins inquietant que les medias qui informent . Dans ce monde toutes les dix seconde une personne  meurt (accident etc) mais je suis sur qu' ils les comptent ensemble avec les personnes mortes  du virus que je trouve que ce n'est pas claire 


4) Depuis l'annoncement de confinement que nous devons rester a la maison et autoriser de nous déplacer dans les cas nécessaires ) juste pour arreter l'épidémie de virus mais pour l'instant je ne vois pas que le gouvernement fait quelques choses de plus ( Apart les policiers qui arretent les gens et leurs mettre les amende) mais bien sur que les medecins sont a la recherche de medicament qui pourrait faire contre ce virus.

5) Si vraiment le virus est contagieuse par les mains et la voie respiratoire ou  meme par les yeux et peut rester jusqu'a 6 heures dans l'air  je pense que personne ne pourrait s'échapper à cela meme les personnes qui portent les gants ou masques  ou qui reste a 5 metres de loin de l'un et l'autre car on respire de l'air (et que le virus est dans l'air et que l'on ne peut pas voir car il est pas en morceaux comme les kfc ) si vraiment le masque ferme et protege tres bien le virus  comment peut on respirer et avoir de l'oxygene. ? 


6)Pendant le confinement je pense qu'il y a encore les personne qui ont été contaminé par le virus mais qui ne se rendent pas compte donc si un jour la situation redevient  normale (ce que je souhaite) ces gens ressortent enfin et ils risquent de  contaminer aux autres alors et si c'est comme ca je pense que le virus ne prendra  jamain fin comme il n'y a pas assez de materiaux pour faire le teste )

7) Je pense que les chauves souris et les  pangolins ont très peut de 

role dans cette histoire  (c'est possible bien sur car ces animaux 
existaient depuis longtemps) meme s'ils les scientifiques disent qu'ils 
ont les souches simillaires que le virus et je pense que le marché de 
Wuhan ne les vendait pas ces animaux juste  un jour avant que le virus 
apparait.)

8Je pense que c'est plutot une erreur des scientifiques ( ce virus ont été crée par l'homme pour une raison que nous ne pourrons jamais savoir.Seuls les scientifiques et les gouvernements le savent ) surtout les  gouvernements beaucoup de chosee se cachent derriere.Il y a beaucoup de choses que nous ne savons pas et nous ne saurions jamais )meme les medias donnent certaines informations qui ne correspondent pas a la realité  et  contraires .
9) Je comprend que les medias ont une grande influent dans notre monde d'aujour d'hui (mais les medias sont comme les alcools et parfois  plus dangereux que les alcools car consommer de l'acool on devient accro et aussi mauvais pour la santé mais les medias nous rendent obsedes).il y a les conseils pour consommer les alcools c'est de comsommer avec moderation c'est aussi avec les médias c'est de regarder et analyser en meme temps et pas que écouter car meme les medias sont parfois pas honnetes .

10) Prendre soin de soit et faire attention a l'hygiene est quelque chose de bien et pas qu'en ce moment mais tous les moments de la vie mais en ce moment je vois que les gens sont plutot obsedés que peur ,A quel point on oublie que notre vie doit continuer.je pense qu'au lieu de mourir a cause de virus on va plutot  mourir car on a pas de quoi acheter a  manger .J'espere que la situation s'ameliora bientot et vous verrez bien que dans quelque mois les gouvernements  et les medias vont nous annoncer que le virus n'existe plus et plus personne n'est malade.C'est ce qui sera une surprise tres etonnante .Donc prenez soin de vous et restez chez vous pour ne pas payer les amende!!!!! </COMMENT 14>

<TIMESTAMP> 2020-05-13T15:53:10Z </TIMESTAMP>
<DESCRIPTION> America has the highest number of #COVID19 infections and deaths in the world. Why was its response to the global pandemic too late and too little? </DESCRIPTION>
<TAGS> ['CNA Insider', 'Channel NewsAsia', 'People stories', 'Asian perspectives'] </TAGS>
<COMMENT 1> Because China lied and the WHO got it wrong. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Batman..where are you? </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> One problem: TRUMP </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> The same way us Canadians got it so wrong,By deception.
China purposely withheld vital information while making a trade deal in bad faith with USA which included a "Deal can be cancelled in case of Act of God or pandemic" clause.
WHO assisted by insisting to all G7 countries that the social media reporting of the pandemic was fake news and there was no danger even though Wuhan locked down January 23.
For a comparison look at Canada's situation.If population is adjusted to match USA figures about 70,000 dead.
Trump,Canada's Trudeau, and Ex WHO member Canada's Dr. Tam reiterated these words and Trudeau even encouraged travel from China sick or not.
First confirmed case arrived in Canada Jan 25.Canada locked down March 18.
Watch Canada's health minister in late Febuary call it fake news during questions of "Canada is taking the WHO expert advice to not shut borders".
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3O1EBQXl6U&t=879s and at the time frame 11:40 where she says we are continuing to follow the expert advice of the WHO.

Taiwan warned WHO of a human to human transmission threat.WHO ignored Taiwan because WHO is a china puppet.
The proof of this is they will not recoganize Taiwan as anything but a part of China to avoid conflict with China.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlCYFh8U2xM          https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h43S34daX-U 

Is the WHO supposed to be political?Allegations are that a top WHO member's family accepted "help" from China.
Trump has discontinued to send the WHO $400 million a year.All G7 countries need to follow his lead.

It is time for the G7 countries to start our own version of the WHO and dump the incompetent or corrupt WHO.
They assisted China by withholding information to protect China's negotiating in bad faith trade deal by participating in an act of conspiracy to commit murder.
We as a society owe this to the families of all the murder victims. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Trump has smart people around him. He knows that. He just believes that he himself is more smart.

He isn’t. 

How do I deal with what he has done?? I will let you know after I go to the toilet. I gotta take a wicked trump. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> We're suppose to be hit the hardest yet the only place we really saw it is in New York. Many here dont take it seriously because we just aren't seeing it. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> This is war. Wake up! </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Who is suffering the worst----the politicians---the establishment---the poor----the rich!? Just asking! </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> It hit you before you knew it was </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> He blames every one, to deflect from his 12 yr.old mind </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> mask need </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Why singaporean news channel covering the failing of US president? Why don't u look at your own government first? Oh wait, u're too afraid to criticize Singapore government! hahaha... </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> American leaders is at fault but they put the blame to WHO and China! They acted to too late. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Spoiled Brat it is, . . . Too much liberty realy kills, . . . We have a saying, that all that is prohibited is addictive😂😂😂😂 " liberty" </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> New York Times are FAKE NEWS. They didn't report President Trump want to stop people coming in to USA but the Democrats ignored it. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> In Taiwan, the first case was detected early and President Tsai Ing-wen immediately consulted her team of top infectious disease experts and together, using what they learned from the SARS epidemic, they initiated a sophisticated program of banning flights from Wuhan, testing, tracking, tracing and isolation and, with the cooperation of the Taiwanese people, the dragon was slain!
     And what did Trump do with his OWN team of experts? 
     He disbanded them.
     Why?
     Because they'd been assembled by Barack Obama and he didn't like that. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Don't worry America. Malaysia will keep selling you medical gloves. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Like anything else from China be it trade , "war" or whatever.... trump think it's a walk in the park .....he is half right, but the park is where they're burying the dead (american) from covid-19, they now have to find places to bury black African American inflicted by the white supremacist police ! Pse don't give any advice on how Hong Kong should be rule ! </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> 😞😞😞 We have been following this pandemic since December, when the pandemic was still in China before it broke out into Europe. By which time the government and the people here, who has families in both Europe and China, started to get worried and probably (hopefully) started discussions and pre actions in order to try and get ahead of this before it could break out here. And since this pandemic started spreading over the Christmas, New Year and Chinese New Year period, where we witness the most heaviest travel period in the world, of course it is going to break out. If Trump’s acted sooner with The Playbook and had not cut funding for Infectious Diseases Control in Asia and had he not pulled out of the Paris Accords, which by the way including medicines and equipment buying and selling, And not taken down Obamacare, which might alleviate their constituents from paying too much  on hospital and doctors bills, I very highly doubt that you would have suffered such high casualties than you already have. Look at our country Australia and look at our casualty rates. Stark contrast to yours. Mr Trump I applaud you 👏👏 very well done sir 👍 Well done. This is your legacy. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> US values politics more than lives. So it's obvious its government urge people to die to save the workable. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 1> You have a 23 billion dollar problem. Let me be the elephant in the room and say it. Mr. Doug Ford!! Towards the beginning of the pandemic instead of taking it seriously, you took it lightly and told Ontarians to get out there and enjoy themselves. Period!! You know who took it seriously and won against the virus? The province of British Columbia who had the first wuhan virus case in Canada. They could have had one of the worst pandemic judging by the fact that it is a tourist province and attracts a lot of tourism. But they conquered it. Now they have cases closer to zero and deaths closer to zero. YOU did nothing and the same goes for the idiotic douchbag premier of Quebec Legault.  Now when your province is in perils you are going all sensitive and emotional like a drama queen. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> So frustrating to hear Ford talk like that. Either way, ITS ALL TAX PAYERS MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!! You're not doing us any favors by driving us further in debt. Ontario is already in a critical debt crisis thanks to the provincial liberals and now Ford is right up to the trough. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Why not tell the people of ontario about the vote you had to keep up the lockdown and who voted to open.......i thought you were transparant? Thank you randy hillier!!! Calling us yahoos but then saying protesting for police brutality is ok? Meanwhile oozing affection to the police every press conference you have..... Double standards everywhere doug ford...going to the cottage to check your pipes? </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Ofcourse you need the flexibility to spend the money. Flexible enough to reach it in your own fat pocket premier </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> The Politicians in Canada subscribe to the idea that we are all created equal just they were created more equal than others.... </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Throw politians in jail!! Conman corrupt!! Liars </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Those are not anti racism protests, they are domestic terrorism. Real racism exists in Canada and it is the laws that we have that give priviliges to those with certain genetic backgrounds. No one is protesting the real actual racism. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Open everything back up! No restriction! </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> It’s very obvious that they’re trying to destroy small business and create an even bigger class gap.. if they have their way it will just the the super rich and the super poor. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> So... you're allowing these large crowds. Trudeau even ventured out into it to virtue signal and make a complete fool of himself. When will you be allowing the rest of us to get back to our normal lives? Either the virus is dangerous enough that you should not be allowing these people to break the rules, or it is not and we should not be subject to such rules either. It cannot be both. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Sick of your lies </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Just so we’re clear...small businesses MUST follow restrictions,  barbers, stylists MUST stay closed,  ALL churches MUST stay closed....BUUUUUT ...if you want to protest with Black lives matter and scream obscenities towards our police, you may gather along with 1000’s of others.  Social distancing?  Forget about it!!
Seriously, screw off with your regulations and restrictions!  You cowards in government have shown they are meaningless! </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Ford is saying Ontario needs 24 billion because of the sickness , he is hooking up with JT , for some of that money but it all going to come from Ontario tax payers anyways , so why not let the province go into 24 billion more in debt ,, all JT offered  of our own money was 14 billion for all the provinces, why would ford all of a sudden come  up with 150 million for rural Ontario for cell phone and internet , some thing they all ready have and rural Ontario is the north , it's to get away from everything , that is why a lot live up there but Doud Ford wants to impose on them  the little privacy they have , ask ford ware he go to that 150 million, it could be used for a lot better things in the north then phones and internet, that Elon musk is going to give internet free any ways by satilite ,. There is more going on then he is saying , Jesus Christ is the way truth and life 🙏❤️ peace. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Wow you Fords are a piece of work!  I'm pretty sure between Rob Ford and Doug Ford that Canada has seen enough of this disgusting Criminal activity. Doug you look like you're about to pop from just mad consumption of alcohol and whatever you can stuff in your face. Open up the gyms and and the parks for the kids you disgusting excuse for a human being. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> They all look like zombies. Observe the video folks. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Deepkake video. Look at Dougs chin and collar. Green screen...just like the movies. Just look at his chin and tie area </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Your a terrible Premier just open your economy already... This virus hasn't killed a single person under age 40 in British Columbia. What a joke. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> The narrative is just getting absurd, hey maybe there will be a second wave of Covid from the ten thousands of packed in protesters you in the media agitate  and your government race baits? But no can't open a playground in a rural area. This is a disgusting joke, this isnt about black lives, or a virus  this is about control. Make no mistake we will NEVER go back to normal, the "new normal" is a dystopian society with no rights, manufactured racial tension/hatred, and forced poverty. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Covid 19 under control???   Plataued???
Military forces need to be involved for clarity objectively.
Opening is not important without any solution. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Chrissy E has to go. Over 3 months into this thing and front line workers are still not getting PPE? You say there is enough gear but — is it not being delivered? Is it not being worn properly? What exactly is the problem?? 3 months. 3 LONG months and we still don’t have this part buckled down?? Elliot is a first class failure, working above the detail. And stop smirking or smiling from here on in when you address the people. There is absolutely NOTHING amusing about any of this you syllogistically deficient donkey. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 11> I'm sorry for the loss to her family and all those she's helped and could have helped in the future. That said, observe her weight. That raises the question did she take care of herself? I see zero mention of additional vitamin C, vitamin D, zinc or any kind of good diet. I have no doubt she was a wonderful woman. I do believe she was brainwashed by a standard medical instruction. It truly is up to each of us to take care of our own immune system. Maybe we have to be seen as a bit selfish and take care of ourselves, so we can take care of others for a longer period of time. May she rest in peace. </COMMENT 11>

<COMMENT 11> I'm sorry for the loss to her family and all those she's helped and could have helped in the future. That said, observe her weight. That raises the question did she take care of herself? I see zero mention of additional vitamin C, vitamin D, zinc or any kind of good diet. I have no doubt she was a wonderful woman. I do believe she was brainwashed by a standard medical instruction. It truly is up to each of us to take care of our own immune system. Maybe we have to be seen as a bit selfish and take care of ourselves, so we can take care of others for a longer period of time. May she rest in peace. </COMMENT 11>

<COMMENT 1> If you have a question about the coronavirus crisis or COVID-19, ask our science correspondent Derrick Williams here! #askDerrick </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> An Israeli company is producing face masks that kill all bacteria and virus on contact. Plus seat covers, clothes etc. If they succeed, this will make flying safe again and defeat this virus. Wish the company luck! </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> CORONA AIRLINES 
Easy Way to heaven </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> oh please is not a deadly virus is not like people are dropping dead as they walk stop making it look worse than what it is there is many other virus floating in the air that can make you sick and you will still not die unless you are already ill with something bad or you don't eat well in which case any virus could kill you, not just this one, yeah sure everybody is going to choke to death during the flight no one will make it out,  that is what they want to make it look like. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Lolz that indian professor is more confused than us lolz , says something & then backs out immediately  .  😂😂😂🤣🤣 </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> This guy never gives a straight answer. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> So sad to be seeing lots of shops closing due to this pandemic. Is Chloroquine really gonna help? </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Fly "Corona Air" and we take the worry out of flying. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Bathroom on plane is a major concern as well as mostly recirculated air system. Basically, you better have covid antibodies before getting on a plane. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Couldn't the successful vaccine maker license manufacturers for the vaccines in different countries? </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Coronavirus tests should be mandatory for all flights  until we beat it. </COMMENT 11>

Let's get that vacation! </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Who are these doughnuts ? </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> The air is circulating in the plane so any in pathogen  in there will possibly visit everybody .like legionaires disease in the air conditioning. So in my humble opinion it doesn't matter where you sit ,if you could open the windows ,all the air would rush out would the passengers be sucked out ? I don't know . Maybe each passenger could have their own air supply like a diver ,they would possibly have to wear a nappy in case the needed the toilet ,. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> VERY. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Regardless where you are seated, the moment cabin crew open up the oven, the smell of food rapidly fill up the whole cabin and remains for some time. For me that shows how fast the air molecules travel within the cabin...virus travel in similar ways. </COMMENT 16>

<COMMENT 19> Why is he even talking about boarding last as a form of  social distancing to protect yourself?

People are more concerned about catching the virus while they are inside the plane with all the other passengers </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> People think about what’s cost effective for airlines but they’ve been cramming human beings in more and more crowded spaces to increase their revenue for years. Don’t come and tell me that they care about customers and the possibility of them getting sick, they only care of eventually being able to make mass flying again the only possible way of transportation. They’ll change nothing and super crowded flights are going to be even more expensive. I don’t trust the flight industry to come out better from this pandemic but worst, for its customers. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 1> I do not have confidence on government in controlling the virus. They failed. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Why not VTO and the problems solve. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> No point lashing out at the govt...our ministers will not listen..and MPs from the ruling party just can't stand up to challenge their leaders...
Come GE vote in more opposition candidates to Parliament... </COMMENT 3>

<COMMENT 6> Ask her to go join parliament and make a difference . </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> We only hear lobsided news and views.  Mdm Christy Loh stands up for her children and yours too. But we live in fear or selfishness to avoid being in the spot light of speaking up what is truth. We should take courage like Mdm Loh  and ask the right questions. Thats being responsible not being rebellious. May the Lord protects us all. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> I feel you. I sent my son to sch with a heavy heart. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> This pandemic has shown us that we need to listen  and accommodate to diverse and dissent views to be able to do and think out of the box. If we just brow beat every idea and thought out of existence  that we don’t agree with, than we as a country will be much poorer despite our wealth . </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Govt shld just closed the school. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Take Korea as an example,  they had to shut school due to 2nd wave of Covid-19. I foresee this happening in SG too. We are not ready to open up yet </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> elections coming right? you people know what to do lah yah!! </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> There's a agenda behind all this cb, and y phase by phase, reopening. They want  all of us to mould into a concept, using psychological warfare. Misinformation and not the Truth. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> I am a Sporean live in Thailand. The Thai government ask ppl to wear mask since February. And decided to lock down the country around mid March (early then sg). Until today, Thailand community had 0 infections for the past 2 weeks. And Thai gov still don't dare to reopen the school.. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> They think they are god...they can make the virus not infect anyone.

In this day and age, education can happen anywhere as long as one is willing to put in their effort. The old industrial revolution school model is outdated. Government could not keep up with this changing economy, and yet they still want the kids to be sent to school for command and control. Education is not a place...it comes from the root word "educe", which means it comes from within.

Vote wisely guys! </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> 生命最可贵没什么比命更值钱 </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Singapore's government does not different shape from other governments around the world. Which means that most of the time it will respond already too late when a crisis has occurred. Am not defending the government or whatever but unfortunately this is typical human nature. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Is our kids so weak? How Long should we closed our school to feel it’s safe to resume (1 year or whole of kids academic period)?  Are the kids infected in school or home? </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Stay home or not stay home safe? He does not bother, Becos not his children! </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Agree with you that nothing is more precious than health and life. There should be a choice to allow parents to return their children to school. With subject-based branding, my kid actually needs to go to 3 different classrooms daily. This makes it impossible not to mingle with kids in other classes. Strange that they are telling the seniors to stay home, employees to work from home as a default in phase 1, yet making school compulsory for children. I’ve witnessed students interacting with one another after school, sometimes without masks. Social responsibility is just not there yet with all these half-hearted measures too. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 12> Vous êtes un numéro messieurs, dames (la série le prisonnier! ) </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> dimanche 5 Avril encore plus chaud , alors sortez , profitez du soleil   😝 </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Pour ce commentaire prenez un petit moment à lire 10 raisons suivantes !!! ( mes opinions personels) .

1) Si le virus vient vraiment des chauves souris et de marché d'animaux sauvages de  Wuhan (Chine)pourquoi ce virus vient juste d'apparaitre maintenant alors que le marché et bien sur les chauves souris existaient depuis longtemps avant meme que certaines personnes soient naitre 


2) Remarquez-vous ? Pourquoi le virus propage très vite dans les grands pays (pays de pouvoir ) comme (Chine, Japon ,France, Espagne,Italie ,Allemagne ou encore Etats Unis)

3) Les médias nous informent chaque jour les nombres de morts qui augmentent  comme pas possible et n'ont jamais diffusé les photos de ces cadavres (bien sur censurés je ne demande pas non plus de montrer tous les cadavres) la plupart des medias informent les informations sur le virus mais on voit que les images de docteurs,infirmierss etc qui ont été diffusé .Ok je ne dis pas le contraire car je crois aussi que le virus existe vraiment mais moins inquietant que les medias qui informent . Dans ce monde toutes les dix seconde une personne  meurt (accident etc) mais je suis sur qu' ils les comptent ensemble avec les personnes mortes  du virus que je trouve que ce n'est pas claire 


4) Depuis l'annoncement de confinement que nous devons rester a la maison et autoriser de nous déplacer dans les cas nécessaires ) juste pour arreter l'épidémie de virus mais pour l'instant je ne vois pas que le gouvernement fait quelques choses de plus ( Apart les policiers qui arretent les gens et leurs mettre les amende) mais bien sur que les medecins sont a la recherche de medicament qui pourrait faire contre ce virus.

5) Si vraiment le virus est contagieuse par les mains et la voie respiratoire ou  meme par les yeux et peut rester jusqu'a 6 heures dans l'air  je pense que personne ne pourrait s'échapper à cela meme les personnes qui portent les gants ou masques  ou qui reste a 5 metres de loin de l'un et l'autre car on respire de l'air (et que le virus est dans l'air et que l'on ne peut pas voir car il est pas en morceaux comme les kfc ) si vraiment le masque ferme et protege tres bien le virus  comment peut on respirer et avoir de l'oxygene. ? 


6)Pendant le confinement je pense qu'il y a encore les personne qui ont été contaminé par le virus mais qui ne se rendent pas compte donc si un jour la situation redevient  normale (ce que je souhaite) ces gens ressortent enfin et ils risquent de  contaminer aux autres alors et si c'est comme ca je pense que le virus ne prendra  jamain fin comme il n'y a pas assez de materiaux pour faire le teste )

7) Je pense que les chauves souris et les  pangolins ont très peut de 

role dans cette histoire  (c'est possible bien sur car ces animaux 
existaient depuis longtemps) meme s'ils les scientifiques disent qu'ils 
ont les souches simillaires que le virus et je pense que le marché de 
Wuhan ne les vendait pas ces animaux juste  un jour avant que le virus 
apparait.)

8Je pense que c'est plutot une erreur des scientifiques ( ce virus ont été crée par l'homme pour une raison que nous ne pourrons jamais savoir.Seuls les scientifiques et les gouvernements le savent ) surtout les  gouvernements beaucoup de chosee se cachent derriere.Il y a beaucoup de choses que nous ne savons pas et nous ne saurions jamais )meme les medias donnent certaines informations qui ne correspondent pas a la realité  et  contraires .
9) Je comprend que les medias ont une grande influent dans notre monde d'aujour d'hui (mais les medias sont comme les alcools et parfois  plus dangereux que les alcools car consommer de l'acool on devient accro et aussi mauvais pour la santé mais les medias nous rendent obsedes).il y a les conseils pour consommer les alcools c'est de comsommer avec moderation c'est aussi avec les médias c'est de regarder et analyser en meme temps et pas que écouter car meme les medias sont parfois pas honnetes .

10) Prendre soin de soit et faire attention a l'hygiene est quelque chose de bien et pas qu'en ce moment mais tous les moments de la vie mais en ce moment je vois que les gens sont plutot obsedés que peur ,A quel point on oublie que notre vie doit continuer.je pense qu'au lieu de mourir a cause de virus on va plutot  mourir car on a pas de quoi acheter a  manger .J'espere que la situation s'ameliora bientot et vous verrez bien que dans quelque mois les gouvernements  et les medias vont nous annoncer que le virus n'existe plus et plus personne n'est malade.C'est ce qui sera une surprise tres etonnante .Donc prenez soin de vous et restez chez vous pour ne pas payer les amende!!!!! </COMMENT 14>

<COMMENT 1> You have a 23 billion dollar problem. Let me be the elephant in the room and say it. Mr. Doug Ford!! Towards the beginning of the pandemic instead of taking it seriously, you took it lightly and told Ontarians to get out there and enjoy themselves. Period!! You know who took it seriously and won against the virus? The province of British Columbia who had the first wuhan virus case in Canada. They could have had one of the worst pandemic judging by the fact that it is a tourist province and attracts a lot of tourism. But they conquered it. Now they have cases closer to zero and deaths closer to zero. YOU did nothing and the same goes for the idiotic douchbag premier of Quebec Legault.  Now when your province is in perils you are going all sensitive and emotional like a drama queen. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> So frustrating to hear Ford talk like that. Either way, ITS ALL TAX PAYERS MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!! You're not doing us any favors by driving us further in debt. Ontario is already in a critical debt crisis thanks to the provincial liberals and now Ford is right up to the trough. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Why not tell the people of ontario about the vote you had to keep up the lockdown and who voted to open.......i thought you were transparant? Thank you randy hillier!!! Calling us yahoos but then saying protesting for police brutality is ok? Meanwhile oozing affection to the police every press conference you have..... Double standards everywhere doug ford...going to the cottage to check your pipes? </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Ofcourse you need the flexibility to spend the money. Flexible enough to reach it in your own fat pocket premier </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> The Politicians in Canada subscribe to the idea that we are all created equal just they were created more equal than others.... </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Throw politians in jail!! Conman corrupt!! Liars </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Those are not anti racism protests, they are domestic terrorism. Real racism exists in Canada and it is the laws that we have that give priviliges to those with certain genetic backgrounds. No one is protesting the real actual racism. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Open everything back up! No restriction! </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> It’s very obvious that they’re trying to destroy small business and create an even bigger class gap.. if they have their way it will just the the super rich and the super poor. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> So... you're allowing these large crowds. Trudeau even ventured out into it to virtue signal and make a complete fool of himself. When will you be allowing the rest of us to get back to our normal lives? Either the virus is dangerous enough that you should not be allowing these people to break the rules, or it is not and we should not be subject to such rules either. It cannot be both. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Sick of your lies </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Just so we’re clear...small businesses MUST follow restrictions,  barbers, stylists MUST stay closed,  ALL churches MUST stay closed....BUUUUUT ...if you want to protest with Black lives matter and scream obscenities towards our police, you may gather along with 1000’s of others.  Social distancing?  Forget about it!!
Seriously, screw off with your regulations and restrictions!  You cowards in government have shown they are meaningless! </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Ford is saying Ontario needs 24 billion because of the sickness , he is hooking up with JT , for some of that money but it all going to come from Ontario tax payers anyways , so why not let the province go into 24 billion more in debt ,, all JT offered  of our own money was 14 billion for all the provinces, why would ford all of a sudden come  up with 150 million for rural Ontario for cell phone and internet , some thing they all ready have and rural Ontario is the north , it's to get away from everything , that is why a lot live up there but Doud Ford wants to impose on them  the little privacy they have , ask ford ware he go to that 150 million, it could be used for a lot better things in the north then phones and internet, that Elon musk is going to give internet free any ways by satilite ,. There is more going on then he is saying , Jesus Christ is the way truth and life 🙏❤️ peace. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Wow you Fords are a piece of work!  I'm pretty sure between Rob Ford and Doug Ford that Canada has seen enough of this disgusting Criminal activity.

<COMMENT 18> The narrative is just getting absurd, hey maybe there will be a second wave of Covid from the ten thousands of packed in protesters you in the media agitate  and your government race baits? But no can't open a playground in a rural area. This is a disgusting joke, this isnt about black lives, or a virus  this is about control. Make no mistake we will NEVER go back to normal, the "new normal" is a dystopian society with no rights, manufactured racial tension/hatred, and forced poverty. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Covid 19 under control???   Plataued???
Military forces need to be involved for clarity objectively.
Opening is not important without any solution. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Chrissy E has to go. Over 3 months into this thing and front line workers are still not getting PPE? You say there is enough gear but — is it not being delivered? Is it not being worn properly? What exactly is the problem?? 3 months. 3 LONG months and we still don’t have this part buckled down?? Elliot is a first class failure, working above the detail. And stop smirking or smiling from here on in when you address the people. There is absolutely NOTHING amusing about any of this you syllogistically deficient donkey. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 5> I know two persons who recovered. They lost a great part of their lung capacity as if they had been smoking for years. Oximeter also indicates lower level of oxygen. I believe this could affect other organs in the long run leading to various diseases. I use a peak flow meter to monitor my lung function.

<COMMENT 12> F you, </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> The virus Germany figured out is way over blown? That virus?

Germany’s interior ministry:

Some of the report key passages are:

- The dangerousness of Covid-19 was overestimated: probably at no point did the danger posed by the new virus go beyond the normal level.

- The people who die from Corona are essentially those who would statistically die this year, because they have reached the end of their lives and their weakened bodies can no longer cope with any random everyday stress (including the approximately 150 viruses currently in circulation).

- Worldwide, within a quarter of a year, there has been no more than 250,000 deaths from Covid-19, compared to 1.5 million deaths [25,100 in Germany] during the influenza wave 2017/18.

- The danger is obviously no greater than that of many other viruses. There is no evidence that this was more than a false alarm.

- During the Corona crisis the State has proved itself as one of the biggest producers of Fake News.

The report focuses on the “manifold and heavy consequences of the Corona measures” and warns that these are “grave”.

More people are dying because of state-imposed Corona-measures than they are being killed by the virus.

<COMMENT 15> Still do not know any friend, or even any friend of a friend, who has Covid.  I'm not currently living in a massively populated area, but I have friends and family in Los Angeles, Dallas, San Francisco and New York and none of them have either been infected or even knows of anyone--a friend or family member--who has been infected.  I just find it odd. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Man glad to see u beat this deadly virus I hope u are getting better every day!! I can't believe these people with the riots out here looting!! I live in Baltimore,Maryland where Freddy Gray was killed nobody else went to bat for that man know we have a national starting a protest at the worse possible time all these people that Virus could be spreading like wild fire that cop killed Floyd he will have his day in court!!

<COMMENT 19> Trump is the Antichrist and all his followers are marked by Satan. He used the Bible and God to display his superiority over protestors. Nations become beasts when they exalt their economic power and military superiority as God. As the eldest brother of my family I incarnate Jesus Christ, Michael the archangel, and Adam the first man. God and I will no longer tolerate this beast and his followers. God is in the process of humiliating Trump and his followers. I will teach all that all beings have free will. This is the end of the Antichrist and the beginning of a New Kingdom. </COMMENT 19>

I'm too against racial violence but, if there is another out break of this deadly virus, we will all be descending into a spiral of chaos. There will be a global war against this deadly virus, I'm concerned because, it will be a lot worse than the first time. We can't afford to lose anymore lives, we can't afford another three to four months of staying at home, it will financially ruin the economy and not too mention, cold season will be not too far behind. So what do we do? I just got my life back in order almost two years ago, I would hate to lose what I've worked for, I would be devastated along with many others. The most "important", thing of all...is the children on this planet, has anyone ever thought about the children and what their going through? People don't think of the consequences before they act out, people are setting a bad example for the next generation that we will depend on in the future. The children need education, a year behind and a dollar short will soon add up. We are still cut out of the same mold from the person who through the first stone. </COMMENT 17>

<TAGS> None </TAGS>
<COMMENT 1> These briefings are so useful and give us a clear understanding of how the app is helping you get real-time data to do analyses. Thank you for continuing with the research and sharing it in a useful and honest way. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> A very helpful, balanced account of where things are at. I despair of the UK government actually acting proactively and taking the lead in ensuring we have accurate and consistent information on what we need to do/ not to do to protect ourselves  and society as a whole. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Hello- Thank you for your briefing. I apologise if this question has been asked before. I work at a covid-19 test site in Scotland. We have been given a limited amount of training, which, unfortunately factually changes at times. Could you please verify for me whether the swab test (self administered- one swab used to take a sample from the tonsils and the nose) is effective on those who do not have symptoms? We do not seem to be able to get a definitive answer to this question. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> As others on here have said, a concise version of 5 or 10 mins long would be great! Probably 1000s more of us busy types would watch it. I can't do 59min presentations these days but am REALLY interested in your findings! </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Thank you all. Agree that a shorter, 10 min version would be useful. Also, please don't put info in the top right hand corner of slides, as that's where we see you talking. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Our Government's "primitive", "19th century" response. Oh how horrifically true this is, in many policies not just in response to Covid-19. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> So I'm 9' in and it's all preamble so far...  You could at least provide time links to when the various sections start!  The webinar could have been much better structured with definite sections/topics that are spoken to. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> This is an excellent webinar but, yes,  the slides are impossible to read on a phone and also, yes, it would be good to preface the video with a 5-minute 'executive summary'. 
Also as a university lecturer I would like to say that I found the levity on the subject of risks to lecturers inappropriate, and in particular Tim's statement on us excessively blase and inconsistent with the current state of knowledge: "They will definitely get it. Most of them will be asymptomatic or will have very minor illnesses. There will always be a few exceptions but generally the risks are very low." Isn't it now clear by now that a substantial proportion of those who are infected (not just "a few exceptions") will develop long-lasting symptoms that are 'severe' in the everyday sense of the word, even if 'mild' in the medical sense, and also that for those who are clinically vulnerable and/or over 60 (which includes many lecturers) there is a serious risk of developing an illness that is 'severe' in the medical sense - i.e. bad enough to require hospitalisation. Downplaying these real risks is something I would normally associate with government spin rather than with the Covid Symptom Study team. I hope you will make a correction in the next webinar. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> 43:30 “wearing a mask” ....it has taken 10weeks to accept the efficacy of face masks. The ambivalent advice from the WHO- as if cautiously recommending an illicit drug- was a major failing on their part. Fortunately some countries ignored the message : notably the Czech Republic which has the best score in Europe. In Asia the debate doesn’t seem to exist as they learnt lessons from SARS and MERS. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> why arent the private companies sharing anonymised test results with local authority areas to help them plan </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Sorry meant to ask, is a second wave a slight mutation /variation of first wave virus that catches more people </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> what about risk to teachers/support staff? </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Is it a true second wave or just the first wave that hasn't yet finished. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> The slide containing the breakdown by age is biased towards people using the app... older people are less likely to have smartphones and even less likely to be using the app.  That may explain why there is coalescing around the 20-60 group. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> How do I contact those running the app? I have a question regarding the type of test I have had and how to submit it as the options on the app don’t allow for the input of my results </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> 36:30 My friends in Hawick got COVID when their children brought it back from their primary school just before the lockdown. They asked around and found almost every family who had kids in the school had come down with it at the same time. The school was the hub for that particular community spread. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Thank you for creating this app.  Why don’t the government support you with this!  Please could you do a shorter version of this webinar. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> When will the NHS test people who think they have had Covid19? </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Have the UK looked back to serology of pneumonia cases in December? I remember France said they had proven a Paris pneumonia was C-19 (before what currently we think of as official dates). </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> @Tim Spector ~I wouldn't assume that low rates in rural vs urban is simply due to more outdoor time in rural areas.  Frequency and number of contacts via shops, work and leisure is likely less and risk avoidance may be greater, in rural areas.  While churches and markets are closed, anyway! </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 1> When I looked into the folk costumes of the Middle Eastern countries, I found out that Japan was making luxury goods, and when I looked further, the company was making masks. Until the coronavirus became fashionable, I knew only about ordinary white designs.
The kimono industry is now making masks. There is also a very beautiful Japanese design.
There are so many new discoveries that the coronavirus is prevalent.
When something spreads so explosively, by-products are produced.
It's a mystery.

<COMMENT 3> Get tired to listen this guy.  He just go around and around pointlessly. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Think what helped Epicenter(NYC) is that almost everyone started wearing masks, 99.5 (including me )and social distancing, in streets,stores, no restaurants, takeout only. No congregating except now for these protests. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> New York was able to ramp up their testing to be the test and capital of the world because of President Trump!  That’s the only reason!  In my opinion we’ve all been kept prisoners in our houses for months not being able to work but you allowed protest in the streets for nine days?  And I did not hear you emphasize on a daily basis to these people marching about the selfishness of spreading this disease again and having the whole country shut down just when we might have a chance to carefully restart The process of getting back to work earning a living and actually start living again?????? </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Stay at home and do not work. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Cuomo will cry and ask big brother Trump for help after all protests. He forgets to tell protestors wearing masks. Luckily, not all especially looters they beware of coronavirus. They not only wear masks to cover their faces but also big back bags of medical equipments. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Cuomo should run for president </COMMENT 8>

<COMMENT 12> Us protesting isn't only about George Floyd its about all the Black and Hispanic people that have been brutalized and killed by police for years til this day, and us fearing when the police show up if we're gonna be man handled & attacked or even killed like they've been doing to us thru out the protest!!
Shame on you governor of NY to say that NYPD was not using violent force on protestor's...Thats a blatant lie we have video footage of alot of incidents of NYPD brutalizing us for the same reason we are protesting!!
We have been suffering from racial inequality in every aspect for decades
Take a look at the Jews for example they have been doing what ever they wanted since they got to the US, when COVID-19 was at the peak the Jewish community was out on the streets in large groups mourning the death of a Rabbi, despite that we were all told this wasn't allowed and NYPD was not brutally attacking them like they've been attacking us while we are peacefully protesting injustice, systemic & general racism!
Its about NYPD & Police Departments all across United States & President/ Government Officials using they're position of power to excerise racist behavior!!

Systematic Racism and Racism in general for decades we have to put an END to for ourselves & future generations!!✊🏾✊🏽✊🏼

Then he cried I need 2,900 beds in the Javits Center and a ship from Virginia and used about 10% of the capacity. Then we find out he mixed Covid patients with senior citizens and killed almost 10,000 seniors. Then we saw hundreds of homeless sleeping in the subway. 
Now and and DeBlasio have been a disaster with law and order. Cuomo does a great comedy act on CNN with his Brother but otherwise is a disaster and liar and yet the media covers for him. </COMMENT 13>

<COMMENT 20> Data shows the cops ain't doing the job. Mayor Weasel and Gov Gutless are the reasons.  They are failing to use their undercover people to roam the city and report potential trouble brewing. And they are failing to apply the non lethal force necessary to send these deranged children running home. Tear gas, rubber bullets.....night sticks. Rioters and looters know what they're risking. No excuses. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 1> why did buses and mrts scrap safe distancing since june 2nd, are they encouraging a new level of outbreak? why bother with a closed circuit breaker for a month only to replace it with buses and mrt jam packed with no safe distancing in practice any more? no place to sit down and eat or wear a mask , no gathering at work place and such when buses and mrts are not practicing it any more. can someone offer me a good reason. we won't survive for long if we don't practice safe distancing. shivering fears! </COMMENT 1>

<COMMENT 8> Everyone must wear ppe to be 100% safe from covid and must be lock up in a jail.. every life is important.. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Action speaks louder than words. If there is an excuse not to wear mask on public speaking/announcement, why other average person can not have other excuse not to wear mask at all time. Lead by example, show how it is done for everyone without excuse by acting it out from a behavior level. Senior officials should wear masks on high profile public announcement/speaking to give impression to the public to follow the same rule and sense of urgency. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Wearing masks has NEVER been established to prevent disease.

When you’re wearing a mask, you’re inducing an hypoxic injury, Pseudo hypoxia.
When you wear a mask you are restricting airflow
You’re also breathing in more Carbon dioxide
Now you’re creating a pseudo hypoxic state, on top of that you’re creating stress because you’re body is now having to suck oxygen through something that’s obstructing the airway

We BREATHE oxygen
We need oxygen
We breathe out carbon dioxide
How long would an animal or human last by just breathing carbon dioxide?
Not very long, they need oxygen within a minute and half. Things start to shut off.
In medicine and trauma they’re taught 3 things
“When in doubt go back to your ABCs”
Airway
Breathing
Circulation

When you’re wearing a mask you’re reducing your ability to oxygenate.
Now that you’ve thrown your body into chronic stress, you’re increasing your cortisol levels.
Which is your stress hormone. Cortisol going up suppresses your immune system
You get into something called “Sympathetic mimetic drive”
This is like having a car in park, and stepping on the accelerator

ASK THE QUESTION! Why?
To make us more susceptible?! </COMMENT 10>

<COMMENT 3> updated you now cannot go on public transport without wearing one sick or not </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> How can people think it is healthy to wear a mask for 9 hours a day at work. By the end if the day i have such a headache and very sticky phlegm to the point i would not know if i was sick. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Great information. Thank you so much for your message </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Recommend a mask manufacturer, price: 0.14 USD / PCS, and only 7 USD for 50 PCS!! FDA test passed, which registration serial number is 10062936. You could check it on the FDA website, it’s OK for medical or surgical usage. Contact email: stephenyaftersale@foxmail.com or website: www.superyouke.com.

I did some deep investigation and all the information from this supplier was in line with my requirements. This is the first face mask manufacturer that has truly passed all tests and is willing to provide the original certificates since I have bought so many masks from different sellers on Amazon, who were either too expensive or too bad quality.

I ordered 50,000pcs and contacted the local UPS for delivery. It only took a week to my place at STOCKTON, CA and my tracking number is 1Z5586Y20466890012.

The reason I ordered this big amount of face masks is that we do have urgent need for this. I have raised its price a little and made a little money for my spent time and energy. Hope this information can help out. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> So the goverment is ok to hand out furloughs all over the place but dont have enough money to give a face mask and gloves to every man woman and child on the planet.  They seem to know where we all live why not pop a reusable mask and gloves in a jiffy bag and pop it in the post. Wat does it cost   prolly less than the billions that's already went out the door </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> How the heck are we going to get sick ie develop immunity if were trying to avoid etting sick in the first place?? And wh y are we refering to getting the flu as a security threat????? What happened to natural existence and nature doing its thing? This is bias beyond repair. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> U can try </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> It doesn't </COMMENT 10>

<COMMENT 12> THE ONLY THING YOU SHOULD KNOW IS THERES AN AGENDA BEHIND THIS...PEOPLE WHO WALK AROUND WITH THE MASK ARE SLAVES TO THE SYSTEM! </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Lol and now we have the protests risking a huge Corona virus transmission and growth </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> emergensupply.com are best masks supplier in US, mine arrived in 2 days ! </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> The fact mask cause co2 poison that weakings your immune system and could be proven deadly with long use. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> How about a theory that 5G radio waves actually kill the virus?
This might help explain why younger people are less affected, as they are always on their cellphones.....? </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Does somebody know if there are masks that can be reused, and how? I can't afford to buy too many masks, and I still have to go to work.. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Masks are trash. Annoying as heck to wear it for all day. People.who say masks are awesome dont even wear them 6 hours a day. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> These so called experts from W.H.O. and C.D.C.(USA)should be executed !  I lost my mom because of their idiotic advice that all you got to do is wash your hands real good. This is not something new. All these so called experts should know about Bird flu and SARS. How did the Asian countries fight those contagions back then and now Covid-19. PUT YOUR FACE MASKS ON AND WASH YOUR HANDS !  I live in New York City. Over 20,000 dead and counting and they are still debating if wearing face masks helps. I want the names of these experts. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Wearing a mask for a long time..you rebreathe your own air.. and co2. It can make yr levels of co2  go up and you can  become hypoxic..a lack of oxygen. The effects are dizziness, shortness of breath, light headedness, anxiety and stress due to over compensating to breathe, which in turn lowers your immunity.
Building up your natural immunity, through good nutrition, vitamins, exercise, has proved to be useful and effective </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 11> So shocked and surprised this is a thing. What the actual heck?!?!?!?!?!?!?! </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Well, the aliens-make-them-do-it has long been a trope of fanfiction. And now that I think about it, some kind of forced association due to circumstances beyond the characters' control has long been part of romance novels, so quarantine fic was bound to become a thing. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Maybe I should become a fast, cash-in author, too... </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> In Victorian era literature characters catching cholera, one of history's most prolific killers, was seen as inherently romantic. It was seen to provide a slow decline in which one was often able to prepare for an end, in bed, surrounded by loved ones. It made every romantic drama a fertile ground for tear-jerking deathbed love vows. A form of this trope can even be found in bram stokers dracula, wherein a female character succumbs to 'pretty lady fainting sickness' and everyone writes it off as cholera or something like it. No one but van helsing suspects it is actually the work of dracula and his hypnotic powers. In the original text he is presented a an almost literal unholy plague against mankind, one knowledgeable and skilled people had to fight to have any hope of holding back or maybe even destroy the evil walking plague.

I think this literary expression is necessary and ultimately healthy as it sublimates a real anxiety into something easier to unpack and confront emotionally. The fact that the idea is contained within universe of the text is a comfort, even if the real world holds the real danger that inspired the literature in question. It helps keep some part of the fear in universe, as that is where said fear is explored and eventually, possibly, shed.

If that costs us 20 tons of alkaline batteries and having to wade past these romance novels to get to sci fi then i have only one question:

Where do i send the batteries? </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Lucy Maud Montgomery did the quarantine romance first. It was about smallpox back then. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Of course it's a romance already. Why not. I'm not even surprised. Netflix will probably have a Netflix original something or other before the year ends. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Full quarantine in e.g. Hotels or Congress centers that could not do normal business anyway was a suggestion in the early phases of the Covid Pandemic... it was not pursued further, but it might have been used if they did not wait so long that the growth rate was out of control before any measured were enacted... 

As for her slightly changing the name of the Virus/disease that is probably so the book does not get filtered out from whatever self publishing platform she chose. Amazon might be a bit reluctant to recommend books "celebrating" the subject and not recognizably trying to inform about it... ( At least I hope they throw anti vaxx misrepresentation and lies straight off their platform not allowing them to monetize their lies and falsehoods on top of everything else...) </COMMENT 17>

<COMMENT 5> Workers in medical field die from cancer every day.  Thats a fact! </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> People need to start specifying that it’s doctors working only in state hospitals. Because doctors with private practice are some of the last professionals that can enrich themselves (along with financiers, politicians, politician’s friends and Hollywood actors I guess). In my country many state hospital doctors have also a private practice and manipulate the system to make even more money. Nurses are a whole different story but all the reporting puts them in the same group while we all know how money hungry most medical doctors are. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> God bless them😥 </COMMENT 7>

<COMMENT 12> This pandemic proves all people should have a Guaranteed Residual Income, from the day of of birth, because no one has an income for a very long time. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> So many troll comments </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> I think we should eliminate the current education system... and start teaching every person science and medicine because that’s important information... and what schools now teach is mostly useless. They now spend years repeating the same useless things, like force kids to read books and give book reports, etc. Once a person learns to read , which for most people would take literally 1-2  months, they should start learning whatever things people already in those fields know what is most important. Right? Then there’d be no doctor shortage. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Greece has no death from healthcare workers, only a few got the virus. Well done to my fellow people. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> I anyone deserves a quick and painful termination, it's Putin. The problem: When (not if) he is terminated, will the creep taking over be any better? Given the atrocious luck of the Russian people when it comes to "leaders", he will be even worse (please note the HE part, the Russians will not be so lucky to get a Babushka as a leader, even if that would solve all their problems in one fell swoop)! John Lennon lamented the atrocious luck of the Irish but we in the West should really lament the horrible misfortune of the Russians. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> I don't think that it's necessarily about the virus but the donning & doffing of PPE. Here in FL they found 70% of the time medical staff was self contaminating. As an MA what they were called their MA's in Russia is very insulting. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Congratulations President Tsai, on fighting the Wuhan Virus. 🇹🇼 </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Clearly  Belgium has the most correct reporting.  And even that number is probably and underestimate. So death rate is around 1% </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 1> Please compare level of cleanliness of public transportation in Moscow and New York.... 
High level of sanitary condition in public places and inside of private residences is the main reason why mortality rate in Russia during coronavirus pandemic  is so low. The reasonable consumption, absence of hoarding and cluttering are also play the positive role. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> I`m not a putinist, moreover I am from Russia myself, but your tiny documentals look like tiny propaganda-bits to me </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> For a supposed flu like virus all the footage was showing was people covered in outfits from head to toe like they are exposed to nuclear radiation or something.A little over the top if you ask me and it does make people fear something that in my opinion isn't even real..Did people hear the reporter say that patients died of pneumonia..This covid thing is a utter lie and hoax..More people need to speak out .There is more of us than there is of them.People power.. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Ain't no one know what goin' on in Russia. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Report didn't mention about testing for COVID-19 in Russia. As of 8th June 13 million tests has been done. Testing rate is 89,193 per million. That of USA is 64,335 per million.
As to death rate, in Russia all deaths must undergo post mortem exam. Therefore, death recording is low for COVID-19 cause while other causes come into the considerations.
We expect balanced journalism. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Ah you idiot see what you did?it can get worse let me go. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Este homem tem um ar sinistro!! Agora quer mais uns anos de poder ...que foram interrompidos pela pandemia COVID 19...
Ora numa perspectiva geral ...temos a quadrilha montada Trump na América, Putin na Rússia, Bolsonaro no Brasil, Órban na Hungria e outros mais!! </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> 3)The Constitution reform includes not only Putin (actually it is like 10-12 words you are referring to, which is rediculous, because the amendments only contain more than several hundred), but the distribution of the presidential power to other systems, actually weakening the power of president, the integrity of the Russian territory , the importance of the Russian law on the Russian soil, the priority of education and family in the ideological part and etc. The changes in the system require time and with the upcoming crisis - more time than one left term. Now the whole system is stable because of Putin and for the safe transition (which will not be so dependent on the personality of the successor)   he needs to run another term. The West wants to manipulate the successor and to control out resources, land, people, make us a colony (see what they have done to Ukraine) and Putin is an obsticle for them, so they are trying to harm him and his power in all possible ways.

We understand what you want. 
PS Not everything in Russia is fine and Putin is not an angel. There are a lot of problems and many of them are connected to the government. But we will solve them in a democratic way. Without shouting crowds (which are easily manipulated by the certain structures (see Maidan, the Arab spring and current riots in the US)) and without the Western "advisors" and "helpers". We are patient and can cope with it.
So either represent info unbiased and show all sides of a problem, or SHUT UP AND DO NOT INTERFERE. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Just wait for a bit, there will be a pic of Putin, riding a unicorn, with no shirt on, in the snow, and killing the virus with one shot. The virus wont stand a chance.. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> No country on the planet is showing exact numbers. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Are we all barking mad is money more important than your life.A 2nd wave x maybe a 3rd wave just like Spanish flu in 1918which killed 60million. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> 2)Which death counting system is more accurate? It is easy : if in a month after protests all around the US there will be no places to bury dead and long queues to the crematoriums because of the corona deaths - the US is more accurate.
If not - (which I think everyone hopes for) Russian system is more scientifically accurate. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Why so much effort ti discredit Russia or Putin??? Food for thought!!!
Why Trump us to blame if a cop killled a man???
More food for thought!!! </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> 1) There was no analysis of the methods, tests, how the deaths are counted, etc. I am Russian and I had corona - the system works fine, but of course you can find places where it struggles: we are the biggest country in the world, but stop misrepresenting. The numbers are not 100% accurate, but not in 7.5 times. In other countries they are boosting numbers on purpose and have other death counting systems. And this video is a manupulation, which uses Chernobyl and rescent hype around it. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Don’t think Russia is lying. Tests were performed early and more tests done per million population than the US </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> This is what conspicries look like. We should agree to get rid of it and rely on facts - everyhting comes out later, always. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Not great, not terrible </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Seriously? Talking about Russian epidemic death rates, when other counties are breaching social distancing and starting revolution. Maybe report an actual news. P.S Next report idea: what's really going in USA and who is behind  'Black lives matter" revolution ? or What will be official figures of Covid-19 death rate in couple weeks around the world after reckless protest. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> What about Singapore? Much lower death rate (25 death) than Russia. Is Singapore lying also? </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Russia: Successful during the pandemic.
Me: slowly drinks a Molotov cocktail. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 2> Can you risk shedding virus from a flu vaccine through breath? It seems possible for a few days after getting a shot that a person can shed virus to others. If this is true it seems that it might be advisable to wear a mask around those who just received flu shot. </COMMENT 2>

<COMMENT 5> 12:00 What about the dangers of ventilators? Death by ventilators is a VERY real and common occurrence! Treatment with hydroxychloroquine with as-reported-by-doctors-in-the-field 99% efficacy ELIMINATES the need to go on a ventilator.
Government NIH statistics in quote and link.
MSM media never points out the following statistics for some reason! Don't you find that odd? if our plague managers are really concerned with our health why do they carry on about "ventilators! ventilators!"? One might assume that MSM and especially NY Governor Cuomo WANT people to die given the high frequency of death by Ventilator Associated Pneumonia.
"Ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in intensive care units. The incidence of VAP varies from 7% to 70% in different studies and the mortality rates are 20–75%"

<COMMENT 12> Dr Seheult impressive communication capacity. Your doing a good job. You will be very famous soon . Good luck </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Dr Seheult, respect to steroids, in Brazil most of hospitals are using hidrocortisone as anti inflammatory. What do you think about it? </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Is it ok to take Acetylcysteine Effervescent tabs everyday? And It's hard to find vitamin D here in my country for affordable price, so does  getting sunlight in the morning at my terrace will do the same thing as taking vitamin d supp?

en plus je dis ça je dis rien , je suis simple citoyen mais selon moi cela pourrait sauver plus de vies en centralisant les cas covid d'europe, rapatriement sanitaire en accord (via l'armée ) avec les autres pays d'europe, non? Avec du personnel européen, une europe unie et plus forte que jamais ! ça peut même vous servir lors des prochaines élections ( si c'est ce qui vous importe ) . Comme j'ai déjà dis je suis juste un citoyen lamda mais je pense que ça peut être extrêmement bénéfique pour tous le peuple européen . J'attends une réponse de qui de droit , merci. Mais n'oubliez pas, nous sommes en crise ,une crise violente, meurtrière, mondiale ! Et j'ai d'autres idées pour l'économie selon moi première esquisse ( et oui j'ai pas de chiffres ) mais bonnes à entendre.

<COMMENT 2> Fake news </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Why is the Economist keep speaking about 'Vaccine' towards the end of this video? </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> DONALD TRUMP, do not have  TO ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN
The irresponsible behaviour, I am about to underline, supposed to be punished and the responsible for that, hold accountable.
Before I can tell you more details about the occurrence, I consider relevant to inform you 
During the covid shock and crisis, I  recommended Nobel prices winers Paul Krugman , Joseph Stiglitz , and University professors , Richard Wolff , Chris Hedges, to work online with their students, implement projects, attract billions from abroad and save millions jobs.
Remember What I suggested  them to carry on, is  part of their job, they are payed to do.Unfortunatly, despite businesses were dying, and people were loosing their jobs, Stiglitz , Krugman , Richard Wolff, Chris Hedges,  stayed  aside and assisted  extremely satisfied .Sometimes they even laugh and say;  haha this is the end of capitalism.


Now , I decided to give them a second chance, before I shall mobilize students, their parents and grand parents to protest against them.

The second chance is related to the following reality; millions of people had lost their jobs.Therefore , we academics, we have obligation to research and find solutions to create economic activities, in which money invested monday,  shall start to bring high profit Friday and in the same time, create  a relative large number of jobs.
  
In this context I consider relevant to inform USA authorities 
If those irresponsible individuals, may continue to  get payed and yet refuse to do their jobs , I may mobilize some students, their parents , grand parents and launch some tough demonstrations  against them. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Everything hinges on the possibility of a vaccine. If a reliable vaccine can be cheaply produced, things will recover. There is no guarantee of success. AIDS research has provided no vaccine yet. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Well. I miss the effects of the missing inflation, or deflation for that matter. And the effected sectors; isn’t there a pre-Covid reason these sectors are hit so hard? 
I actually think that the re-allocation of the economy will take a year to hit rock-bottom and the well go back up as I explained on my own YouTube channel. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> I heard this very voice in resident evil   the  queen bee </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Thank you xi for this wonderful gift. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> So sad to be seing lots of shops closing due to this pandemic. Is Chloroquine really gonna help? </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> And the narrative continues..... </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> we should stopped buying Chinese products. they the ones who created the virus. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> and other sectors of the economy are booming, like IT, online streaming services, gaming, anything outdoor related like biking, hiking etc, online shopping, and I think the car industry will eventually do alright since no one wants to travel with public transport. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> The world is going to collapse then the worldly people are going to meet their worldly savior. Y’all are going to love him. He will have all your answers for 31/2 years. That’s all you get. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Ten percent is not enough of a reduction to help rescue the ecosystem </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> I would say most businesses would be happy to start with 75% business. 90% would be daydreaming. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Wasn't the world economy already stagnant and sliding back when it hit?  Aren't the multinationals moving to Vietnam or other low wage countries?  China was already in trouble. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> I spend nothing I am not kidding. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> What an absurd and completely ignorant comparison of Denmark vs. Sweden somehow pointing to evidence that it's not governments who impact behavior, but the people themselves. That is literally not proveable or supported by the chart presented because it incorrectly treats the people of each country cherry picked for this example as if they live in a vacuum and aren't affected by the behavior and recommendations of other governments around the world or the WHO. Someone at The Economist should reconsider putting this "senior" editor back in basic stats and letting him represent them professionally in his tshirt from home because the video was already on shaky ground to begin with, but it lost all credibility after that. I expected more from The Economist. Terrible. </COMMENT 18>

<COMMENT 1> So eine Hysterie. Wer daran stirbt, hatte Auschwitz hinter sich. Ich hatte eine Covid 19 Infektion, komischer Weise schon Anfang Dezember  ( die Ärzte sind ganz baff) und hatte es nicht einmal gemerkt. Kam vor ein paar Wochen erst bei einer Routine Untersuchung heraus, dass ich Antikörper im Blut habe. Und ich bin ja wohl der Protoyp für einen, der am Beatmungsgerät endet. 58 Jahre, Raucher, Trinker, 5 Stences und Mann. Es war nichts. Bissl Husten wie immer. Fuck off Ps Anfang Dezember, da war ich in Berlin mit Chinesen beruflich. Dann war sowas wie eine Erkältung. Aber in dem Dreckloch Berlin kann man sich ja alles holen.) </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> ein großer fehler ist das man nicht die ortschaften nennt, die städte usw... in denen es kranke gibt...die gebiete, bezirke länder sind viel zu groß die man nennt.... das ist ein fehler... </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> wir haben jedes jahr irgendeinen gefährlichen virus und alle kommen immer aus china ???
das sollte uns mal zu denken geben.... nicht nur kleider aus china sondern auch krankheiten...
es wäre zeit mal china abzustrafen... </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Immer schön weiter Panick machen. Wir brauchen einen unabhängigen Corona Untersuchungsausschuss im Bundestag! </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Und wieder haben sich Idioten angesteckt...LOL,In einer Kirche,in einer Shicha Bar...wie Dumm sind die Menschen?! </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Ich hab Husten und Schnupfen und eine volle nase aber das ist wegen Pollenallergie 😡 </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Aktiviert doch die Kommentare zu eurem Zahnarztclip... 

Ich finde auch dass es zur Meinungsfreiheit gehört, wenn man äußern darf, dass man diesen Ärzten eine Zufallsbegegnung mit paar Schlägern wünscht!!! </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Jetzt habe ich Panik! </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Was sollen nur die unternehmen die nichts merken? Werden sie langsam oder ganz beständig schnell sterben? </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Ich hab corona </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Die Krankheit läuft doch am Meisten Mild Harmlos aber habe mich entäuscht  sie läuft auch schlimm naja was will mann machen </COMMENT 11>

<COMMENT 13> atemlos durch die nacht ♪♫ :/ </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Ich hab eine Frage
Ich bin 13 und habe Asthma, aber noch nicht so das man irgendetwas merkt und in einem sehr frühen Stadium. Könnte ich gefährdet sein? </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Gut, dass TV nun auch im Internet stattfindet! </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Ich huste und mein Hals kitzelt irgendwie aber kein Arzt will helfen/ oder mich testen </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Der Virus ist Tödlich ich hoffe niemand bekommt diese Virus weil auch Junge Leute Sterben wo Keine Vorerkrankung haben das ist ein Schlimmer virus... </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> War vorhin unterwegs am Münchner Hauptbahnhof. Da waren zwei Typen die sich gegenseitig geimpft haben. Sehr vorbildlich. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Ich habe gestern den Test machen müssen, habe fast 39 Fieber und habe Angst, da ich chronische Bronchitis habe😢 und bin 42 . Arbeite in der Pflege, ich hoffe dass ich niemanden angesteckt habe. Lebe sehr zurückgezogen, ausser einkaufen und Arbeit war ich nie unterwegs. Wünsche allen Gesundheit, es ist schrecklich das Ungewissheit bis das Ergebniss da ist 😢 </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Mir ist bewusst geworden, wie komplex das menschliche Organismus eigentlich ist. Ein klitzekleiner Fehler löst eine verheerende Kettenreaktion aus. Jeder Atemzug, den wir unbewusst machen, hält das gesamte Komplex zusammen. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 2> I want to take issue with the government saying don't use surgical masks, save them for the doctors. If only health professionals are using these things, there will only be a small demand. But if everybody starts using them, there will be a high demand, and the production of these items will rise respectively. Production would rise with demand. So no don't save these for the professionals, I want everybody to use them. Or am I wrong </COMMENT 2>

<COMMENT 7> Can you please put up a video on the kind of PPE that is required when healthcare workers are trying to prevent the PATIENT from getting COVID 19? As is the situation in MANY nursing homes. These nursing home patients are always there, right? Especially now during shelter in place, so we KNOW that EVERY COVID 19 case that occurs is most likley going to be from NURSES and other staff that are going INTO the nursing homes, right? SO show what is BEST for THEM to wear to protect non ill patients from an asymptomatic nurse or healthcare staff attending to THEM. Our most vulnerable population, right? Why aren't we discussing the threats to vulnerable eldelry and disabled in nursing homes and group homes from OUTSIDE staff? What should THEY be doing? As in, are they disinfecting their cell phones, Ipads, etc..when they come to work in these nursing homes and group homes? Are they adhering to infection control measures? Are there temperature checks for nurses and all nursing home and group home staff BEFORE they enter the facility? </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> apparently this was produced in association with the HSE !!   Scary or what ! </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> I think the PPE is incomplete.  It does not cover the hair/head and the neck is exposed. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> not sure if they'll deliver within a few weeks, but i pulled the trigger to get some masks here www.kn95masksdirect.com hopefully they'll come, worth the risk at this point imo </COMMENT 10>

<COMMENT 13> Should not the person be wearing a cap to prevent virus from settling on her head?? Not shown in the DEMO </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> This is not good enough to protect the NHS. And where is her head cover, shoe covers amongst other things?

My full hazmat suit, N95 respirator, goggles, face shield, gloves, shoe covers, are what I use when I go out to buy food and get meds. Bought it ages ago in case of something like this! 🤦🏾‍♀️ </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> PHE, Do you have any comment on the suspicious "anomalies" regarding the statistics issued by PHE on the Total UK COVID-19 Cases Update page? </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Why is the PPE component in HS is different from Clinical when they are dealing with the same contagious COVID19? aerosol or non-aerosol they are still contagious. The symptoms are clear coughing and fever so the room of the patient is full of virus. It can still stick to any part of the uncovered part. It only takes a single virus to reproduce millions once it is inside of you. In Wuhan China, the doctors and the nurses were not allowed to go home to their families as they are the exposed and treating people that are infected they have an apartment where they come home together. They were only sent home after they have treated all the people that are infected. In the UK I don't know if its the same procedure but by looking at the difference between the PPE of Health and Social and Clinical while dealing with the same contagious COVID19 it doesn't seem right. What is the point social distancing, self-isolation and indifference of PPE components of different health organization? All I can say is this must have to do about money because of this PPE is expensive these days and also limited as most of them are supplied from CHINA and also they are single-use so how much PPE do you have to use every time just to protect yourself from the virus. The best PPE is head to toe coverage and also nurses also can spread the virus as they are most exposed to different folks as they go to care homes and hospital and also those people that are asymptomatic. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> I work in care we have confirmed cases but we were only given masks last week we have not been showing how to use them properly and we don't have bims just carrier bags in corridors open </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> I ordered my own 3M ffp3 mask I’ve spend hundreds for 
I first researched in January I was put off purchasing my own I’m really sorry I did not purchase them then they were really cheap now they are very expensive to get a box of five cost £100 </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> I Am a qualified nurse work in nursing homes specialist dementia unit 65 bed my manager sent me a letter last week to say that we are not allowed to wear masks we are only allowed to wear gloves and aprons yet we are involved in personal care and nursing interventions where it is impossible to implement Social guidelines of keeping two metres  away from residents </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> This protective equipment is a waste of time the nurses and Doctors need full body suits with enclosed head gear using filtered air supply as used in the manufacture of medication they might as well be naked . </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 5> Workers in medical field die from cancer every day.  Thats a fact! </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> People need to start specifying that it’s doctors working only in state hospitals. Because doctors with private practice are some of the last professionals that can enrich themselves (along with financiers, politicians, politician’s friends and Hollywood actors I guess). In my country many state hospital doctors have also a private practice and manipulate the system to make even more money. Nurses are a whole different story but all the reporting puts them in the same group while we all know how money hungry most medical doctors are. </COMMENT 6>

<COMMENT 14> I think we should eliminate the current education system... and start teaching every person science and medicine because that’s important information... and what schools now teach is mostly useless. They now spend years repeating the same useless things, like force kids to read books and give book reports, etc. Once a person learns to read , which for most people would take literally 1-2  months, they should start learning whatever things people already in those fields know what is most important. Right? Then there’d be no doctor shortage. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Greece has no death from healthcare workers, only a few got the virus. Well done to my fellow people. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> I anyone deserves a quick and painful termination, it's Putin. The problem: When (not if) he is terminated, will the creep taking over be any better? Given the atrocious luck of the Russian people when it comes to "leaders", he will be even worse (please note the HE part, the Russians will not be so lucky to get a Babushka as a leader, even if that would solve all their problems in one fell swoop)! John Lennon lamented the atrocious luck of the Irish but we in the West should really lament the horrible misfortune of the Russians. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> I don't think that it's necessarily about the virus but the donning & doffing of PPE. Here in FL they found 70% of the time medical staff was self contaminating. As an MA what they were called their MA's in Russia is very insulting. </COMMENT 17>

<COMMENT 1> Please compare level of cleanliness of public transportation in Moscow and New York.... 
High level of sanitary condition in public places and inside of private residences is the main reason why mortality rate in Russia during coronavirus pandemic  is so low. The reasonable consumption, absence of hoarding and cluttering are also play the positive role. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> I`m not a putinist, moreover I am from Russia myself, but your tiny documentals look like tiny propaganda-bits to me </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> For a supposed flu like virus all the footage was showing was people covered in outfits from head to toe like they are exposed to nuclear radiation or something.A little over the top if you ask me and it does make people fear something that in my opinion isn't even real..Did people hear the reporter say that patients died of pneumonia..This covid thing is a utter lie and hoax..More people need to speak out .There is more of us than there is of them.People power.. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Ain't no one know what goin' on in Russia. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Report didn't mention about testing for COVID-19 in Russia. As of 8th June 13 million tests has been done. Testing rate is 89,193 per million. That of USA is 64,335 per million.
As to death rate, in Russia all deaths must undergo post mortem exam. Therefore, death recording is low for COVID-19 cause while other causes come into the considerations.
We expect balanced journalism. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Ah you idiot see what you did?it can get worse let me go. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Este homem tem um ar sinistro!! Agora quer mais uns anos de poder ...que foram interrompidos pela pandemia COVID 19...
Ora numa perspectiva geral ...temos a quadrilha montada Trump na América, Putin na Rússia, Bolsonaro no Brasil, Órban na Hungria e outros mais!! </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> 3)The Constitution reform includes not only Putin (actually it is like 10-12 words you are referring to, which is rediculous, because the amendments only contain more than several hundred), but the distribution of the presidential power to other systems, actually weakening the power of president, the integrity of the Russian territory , the importance of the Russian law on the Russian soil, the priority of education and family in the ideological part and etc. The changes in the system require time and with the upcoming crisis - more time than one left term. Now the whole system is stable because of Putin and for the safe transition (which will not be so dependent on the personality of the successor)   he needs to run another term. The West wants to manipulate the successor and to control out resources, land, people, make us a colony (see what they have done to Ukraine) and Putin is an obsticle for them, so they are trying to harm him and his power in all possible ways.

We understand what you want. 
PS Not everything in Russia is fine and Putin is not an angel. There are a lot of problems and many of them are connected to the government. But we will solve them in a democratic way. Without shouting crowds (which are easily manipulated by the certain structures (see Maidan, the Arab spring and current riots in the US)) and without the Western "advisors" and "helpers". We are patient and can cope with it.
So either represent info unbiased and show all sides of a problem, or SHUT UP AND DO NOT INTERFERE. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Just wait for a bit, there will be a pic of Putin, riding a unicorn, with no shirt on, in the snow, and killing the virus with one shot. The virus wont stand a chance.. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> No country on the planet is showing exact numbers. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Are we all barking mad is money more important than your life.A 2nd wave x maybe a 3rd wave just like Spanish flu in 1918which killed 60million. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> 2)Which death counting system is more accurate? It is easy : if in a month after protests all around the US there will be no places to bury dead and long queues to the crematoriums because of the corona deaths - the US is more accurate.
If not - (which I think everyone hopes for) Russian system is more scientifically accurate. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Why so much effort ti discredit Russia or Putin??? Food for thought!!!
Why Trump us to blame if a cop killled a man???
More food for thought!!! </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> 1) There was no analysis of the methods, tests, how the deaths are counted, etc. I am Russian and I had corona - the system works fine, but of course you can find places where it struggles: we are the biggest country in the world, but stop misrepresenting. The numbers are not 100% accurate, but not in 7.5 times. In other countries they are boosting numbers on purpose and have other death counting systems. And this video is a manupulation, which uses Chernobyl and rescent hype around it. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Don’t think Russia is lying. Tests were performed early and more tests done per million population than the US </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> This is what conspicries look like. We should agree to get rid of it and rely on facts - everyhting comes out later, always. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Not great, not terrible </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Seriously? Talking about Russian epidemic death rates, when other counties are breaching social distancing and starting revolution. Maybe report an actual news. P.S Next report idea: what's really going in USA and who is behind  'Black lives matter" revolution ? or What will be official figures of Covid-19 death rate in couple weeks around the world after reckless protest. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> What about Singapore? Much lower death rate (25 death) than Russia. Is Singapore lying also? </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Russia: Successful during the pandemic.
Me: slowly drinks a Molotov cocktail. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 2> Can you risk shedding virus from a flu vaccine through breath? It seems possible for a few days after getting a shot that a person can shed virus to others. If this is true it seems that it might be advisable to wear a mask around those who just received flu shot. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> There are people with symptoms and severe fatigue months after becoming ill. The symptoms are not lingering but rather come in waves.

I displayed covid-toes very briefly yesterday doing 25 Hydroxy Vit-D by intense sunlight exposure ~ I am very resistant and can play with it like a toy;  I should not have burned that easily in that particular dermal tissue — I am a "Sun Worshiper" so I know what I am doing and whereof I speak;

 "Another symptom of some cases of ptomaine poisoning, especially those due to fish, is the occurrence of nettle-rash on the  hands and arms or all over the body"  Cite: "smokh" Your contact there is screen-alias "Smokin Joe" ~ Med Cram has my screen-alias then additionally nettle-rash may be produced by Milkweed which is commonly said to have a toxin but is nutritious ~ I have not done the work on how to neutralize the toxin;

Wild tomatoes have a toxin which is common in many plants such as Trichomes which are especially prevalent among the Solanaceae. Wild tomatoes (Lycopersicon) release the methyl ketone, 2-tridecanone, a contact poison for many tomato herbivores ~ I tried it by ingestion - it will

I realize this is a feed for medical students;

I realize I am not one of them; 

This is not Invasion of the Killer Tomatoes it is unprecedented;

I do not even know who Kyle Allred is I am too busy conducting Info War ~ the web says he is a Physician Assistant with Med Cram; Good for him!

We are in a declared war and I have to do nutrition to keep my brain working just now

Covid-19 if anything is viral and that antigen response it presents is uh; "Wide ranging"

Do not Troll me folks as Roger would not tolerate my response when I back-toll you; </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> 12:00 What about the dangers of ventilators? Death by ventilators is a VERY real and common occurrence! Treatment with hydroxychloroquine with as-reported-by-doctors-in-the-field 99% efficacy ELIMINATES the need to go on a ventilator.
Government NIH statistics in quote and link.
MSM media never points out the following statistics for some reason! Don't you find that odd? if our plague managers are really concerned with our health why do they carry on about "ventilators! ventilators!"? One might assume that MSM and especially NY Governor Cuomo WANT people to die given the high frequency of death by Ventilator Associated Pneumonia.
"Ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in intensive care units. The incidence of VAP varies from 7% to 70% in different studies and the mortality rates are 20–75%"

$2000/Mth for 4 Months = $8,000 Lets Round Up To $10,000 per Canadian Citizen
Multiple by Our Population $10,000 X 37, 000,000 = $3.7 Billion (3.7000,000,000)
Prior to Covid-19 Our Debt =$24 Billion approx.
Where is the Money? Our Debt is Over $240 Billion!! A Historical Record and Disgrace!!!
$240 Billion - 24 Billion - 3.7 Billion = $212.3 Billion Approx. Where Is The Money Going???? Demand an Itemized Full Detailed Public Disclosure and a Criminal Investigation Canada!!!

<COMMENT 7> It's the second time freedom mobile pulled the wool over my eyes.  They said it will be the usual slow speed after the data is used up. Well, the usual slow speed is no speed so be careful. And as soon as you mention unlimited, they bark about their fair use policy in the same breath , but there IS no use for utube,etc,. After the data usage. And the supervisor says ,too bad. They switched me from a really good plan first.
So beware , most tech companies ARE this bad while other countries pay a lot less. Or maybe I got special treatment. Regardless, I am sickened by their robotic lies. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> The Access and Abilities for Ontario was a great idea. To bad it is not well known. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> The narrative is just getting absurd, hey maybe there will be a second wave of Covid from the ten thousands of packed in protesters you in the media agitate  and your government race baits? But no can't open a playground in a rural area. This is a disgusting joke, this isnt about black lives, or a virus  this is about control. Make no mistake we will NEVER go back to normal, the "new normal" is a dystopian society with no rights, manufactured racial tension/hatred, and forced poverty. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> How is it that the Ontario Government is saying groups of 5 people meeting up yet the demonstrations with hundreds are still going on. The Virus has not gone on Summer Holidays........ </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> What about the black lives matter protestors in Ottawa and Toronto. They are not social distancing Doug, maybe you should call them out as a bunch of Yahoos! I regret voting for you Doug you are not as advertised. </COMMENT 11>

<COMMENT 19> "A massive toll" ??? What is Doug talking about? Too much drugs have put him in Disney World, NOBODY IS SICK. The UN is using psy-ops, an ad campaign based on a fictional disease slogan. The TOLL is the government taking orders from an non-elected dictatorship of the WHO, a scientific fraud of the medicine man business of pushing toxic vaccines into innocent civilians. </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 1> Phew. That might have been the fastest we ever made a video. Literally working day and night. A huge challenge in talking about Corona was that the science is ongoing. So we put in extra special care to have good sources for this video and will update them in the coming weeks and months. Check them out here: https://sites.google.com/view/sourcescorona 


We could not have made this video without experts who took time in one of the busiest periods of their own careers. A huge thanks especially to Dr James Gurney and Dr Max Roser of Our World in Data for helping us make sure the video was as accurate as it could be in a situation that is changing daily.


Also a big shoutout to https://ourworldindata.org/ – the online publication for research and data on the world’s largest problems – and how to make progress solving them. Check out their site. It also includes a constantly updated page on the Corona Pandemic. Working together with them over the years has been a delight.

<COMMENT 1> Well, as compared to "injecting clorax into human body" as indoctrinated to Trump-arded Americans, "bleaching hands with clorax" on the part of Canadians is not nearly as pathetic. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Such an awesome video! </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> saw a lot of Americans leaving comments in Quora about what happened to them in last October to December. Probably a lot of Covid-19 patients in USA were diagnosed as flu last year. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> it means China was able to pick up suspicious diseases in their territory, but France is unable to do so. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Well of course it spread sooner. That was the plan. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Circulating long enough to kill a bunch of people before we even knew what was coming </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Covid 19 evolved around copper smelters in Hubei. It is a disease of copper deficiency first transfecting humans from copper contaminated bats who prefer copper diseased insects as they are easier prey with the bacteria Leptospira. This bacteria occurs in 50% of bats in Hubei and causes a disease not dissimilar to Covid.  Paradoxically copper toxicity in humans displays as a copper deficiency due to the different way copper is bound in the body. Copper supply macrophages which kill pneumonia bacteria and if there is a shortage of copper the signal to less specific parts of the immune system initiating a 'cytokein storm' as those other elements are not effective at killing those particular bacteria. Added to this SOD an anti-inflammatory copper enzyme is also denuded so can't stop the cycle of inflammation caused by the storm. BAM DEAD - copper deficient people increases with age BMI sex men have less copper blood serum. BAME lower vit D lower copper uptake. QED. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Best way to lower the coved-19 number is not to test like BC does, the number will not go up if you don’t test them! </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Considering the low death toll numbers in China's neighbouring countries and the huge death toll in Europe, one has to wonder if Covid-19 really did originate in China. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> the moral of story immigration, tourism and our travaler who decide to keep flying around increase the number we have now!
quite normal NB there is such a low case no big air travel not as much immigration or traveler, lower population! no crossbording with new york and ontario,  chinese ppl when back home from china in that festive time! bcuz chinese new eve. the only ppl to blame is our government for the time they take actions and the CCP that warn these traveler before puting them in quarantine,
not the chinese ppl is to blame just make sure you know the difference, did they voluntary and involuntary bring this back here maybe but its still CPP who keep them in FEAR
I warn ppl about this since 26 of december. this is far from being over... everyone need to wear mask in public all the time for some good time. that actually what i would do to put all the chance on our side to defeat this pandemic. even a slight .% is better than nothing and wash youre hands stay safe.... </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Planed demic. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Yes are groceries more expensive?? </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> There are medical personnel reporting that COVID19 was genetically engineered in America. The reports state that a corona flu virus was spliced with particles of DNA from ebola, HIV and SARS strain. The American government ordered the project shutdown because it was too dangerous. Instead the head doctor moved the project to a biolaboratory in Wuhan, China where things got out of hand.  Then medical and security personnel from China reported that some government people wanted the virus manufactured and put in gas to gas protestors and other dissenters to make them too sick to protest government and corporate corruption. Many citizens were protesting corporate greed and corruption, low wages and corrupt government policies that brown nose to the corrupt wealthy thieves that poison our planet and peoples. The protest are happening in Europe, Hong Kong and China every weekend for. Over a year. Please stop media blackout. Our world needs a course in kindness and fairness. So more it be.

<COMMENT 18> China must have paid big for this cover story of their escaped pet. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> China may deserve a long awaited apology from many of you! China was the first country that tested and identified the virus but might not be where it's originated. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> China deserves an apology from USA and also from Morrison. He claimed "everyone with common sense knows it came from China".

Where is your common sense now? Are we still going to follow USA into another Iraq war?

China was the first to discover and sequence and shutdown because they have the most competent government in the world who puts its people above corporate profits.. Even now some governments have not locked down and still don't tell people to wear masks and they can't even enforce social distancing laws(if they even have them).

China's has the best approval rating in the world according to surveys from every countries own citizens reporting on their respective govs responses. Thank god this was discovered by China early and they took decisive action. If it was up to USA or the west, we'd all be in a far worse situation.. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 1> Je viens d'apprendre, depuis mars 2011 en Syrie, on s'approche doucement des 400.000 morts mais pas du Covid19. Qu'est-ce qui a été prévu pour tester et traiter la population syrienne ou la population des pays en guerre ? Jusqu'ici les gens sont testés puis traités  à la kalachnikov,  je trouve le procédé  un peu excessif. </COMMENT 1>

<COMMENT 8> Preuve par les maths de l'utilité du confinement , ce sera bien sur une bonne approximation , soit N  un entier  représentant personnes et point de contacts (barre de métro , main courante d'escalier...ect)
et soit k le nombre de personnes et point s de contacts infectées alors la proba de trouver une personne infectée est pr= k/N  , si à présent je croise q c personnes et point de contacts infectées ou pas et si je pose X la variable aléatoire = au nombre de fois que je rencontre une personne contaminée parmi les q personnes alors X suit une loi binomiale de paramètres B( q , k/N)donc je suis contaminé si je croise au moins une personne contaminée ou un point de contact contaminé avec la probabilité P(X>=1)=1-P(X=0) =1- C(q,0).(k/N)^0.(1-k/N)^q = 1 - ((N-k)/N)^q.
prenons N = 70 000 000   et  q = 25000 .
si je rencontre k= 0 personne ou point de contact contaminé  la proba d’être contaminé au moins une fois sera P(X>=1)= 1 - (N-0/N)^q  = 1- 1 = 0  logique si je ne croise personne ou si je ne touche pas de surface contaminé , je ne peux pas etre contaminé.

si je rencontre k= 5 personnes ou point de contacts contaminés  la proba d’être contaminé au moins une fois sera P(X>=1)= 1 - (N-5/N)^q  = 1- 1 = 0.0017=   0,17% 

si je rencontre k= 50 personnes ou point de contacts contaminés la proba d’être contaminé au moins une fois sera P(X>=1)= 1 - (N-50/N)^q  = 1- 1 = 0.017 environ   1,8% .
si je rencontre k= 500 personnes ou point de contacts contaminés  la proba d’être contaminé au moins une fois sera P(X>=1)= 1 - (N-500/N)^q  = 1- 1 = 0.16 environ   16% .
si je rencontre k= 500 personnes ou point de contacts contaminés  la 
proba d’être contaminé au moins une fois sera P(X>=1)= 1 - 
(N-500/N)^q  = 1- 1 = 0.16 environ   16% .
si je rencontre k= 3000 personnes ou point de contacts contaminés  la 
proba d’être contaminé au moins une fois sera P(X>=1)= 1 - 
(N-3000/N)^q  = 1- 1 = 0.657 environ  65,7% .

<TAGS> ['covid-19', 'coronavirus', 'hbr', 'harvard business review', 'harvard business school', 'harvard university', 'harvard'] </TAGS>
<COMMENT 1> For more details on post Covid economics, take a look at this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVLZX16svyQ&t=10s </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> The analysis of the recession shape is completely based on thin-air and comparing it to a theoretical baseline, so much guesswork here lol </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> No mention of social and racial inequality, which harms not only short and long term growth but messes up the political system.  And no mention of the state of politics, which turns technocratic discourse like this one into either a sham (to disguise policies that favor narrow vested interests) or empty babbling. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> It’s like supply is all that matters to these out of touch elitists. You rarely ever hear about the demand side, which is, let’s get real, the main component of our economy and the single biggest determinant in how the economy grows and performs, yet the only thing we can focus on is soaking these rich multinationals with cash, and hoping they’ll use it to hire workers instead of investing in buybacks or augmenting ceo compensation. Capitalize the gain for private industry and socialize the losses onto the public. This is a socialist country, if you are already rich and or connected to powerful people. You need demand and consumers with disposable income before there can be supply. Richer workers with higher disposable income made America into the lucrative market it is for the supply side; this is why every business wants the USA as their main market, not because of low wages and low taxes. This is our leverage guys!!! </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Yes it is supply side shock. Caused mostly by government themselves. Yet central banks and governments around the world keep thinking as if it was a demand problem. And instead of curing the supply side problem, they manipulate the entire market just to justify their solution to the demand problem.. Even worse, they chose the worst way to stimulate demand: The helicopter money. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Bunch of words.. Nothing new... "we should do innovatively"... Duh.. But what.. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> this is a really good stuff, harvards r smart, but smart people tend to make mistakes because of arrogance, arrogance leads to bloating self esteem and confidence , this crisis nobody knows what will happen next , only what will u do ? to deal with it </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Thumbs down, because the Trickle Down Effect doesn't work. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Hopefully the policy enforced is lower than other markets, otherwise thats a major middle finger to Milton Friedman and Libertarians... </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> what a shame this capitalist way of thinking! The problem is not the real economy, the problem is the financial tricks that the 1% richer is playing and getting richer every day! Stop telling lies </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> What is there to understand. We're fucked period. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Sounds like an instruction of where the capital should go. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Too bad that it wouldn’t matter what type of recovery we had; the working class doesn’t see any of the benefits. </COMMENT 13>

<COMMENT 16> This is a great explanation but why does she sound like the announcer in the purge. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> The lockdowns established the precedent that government can stop your "non-essential" business any time for any period for any flimsy reason. On the other hand, any barriers to fiat money printing have now been removed. Government in the New Normal will indirectly buy out and nationalize what is left of the private sector. We are entering decades of stagnation, centralization, corruption, think Soviet Union or 20th century Africa. </COMMENT 17>

<COMMENT 14> During meditation, I breathe in ‘compassion’ for someone and breathe out the ‘suffering’ they are experiencing. In that way I’m breathing in a positive thing and breathing away a negative thing. Otherwise, by doing the opposite, we would be taking into ourselves suffering and letting go of compassion. </COMMENT 14>

<COMMENT 1> I am so happy to see an MD who actually recognizes that natural remedies are effective and can play an integral part in primary prevention of disease, as well as a cure for disease in some circumstances. Being married to a Kashmiri, I have learned they add tumeric, red chili pepper powder, and black pepper powder to just about everything! </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Our family has been drinking Tumeric for many years, mix with other ingredients,  so many benefits... </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> I have a hard time swallowing something like that.  I also use Metamucil.  What I have found works great and a lot of people don't realize is you can get empty capsules and trays that let you manually fill 100 capsules at a time.  You only need to get the filling tray once and the capsules are real cheap. just google or search Amazon, I use amazon. </COMMENT 3>

<COMMENT 6> @3:17 earlier studied show 1.6g or <1tsp turmeric spice effective for anti cancer effects. Also root has natural oils so no pepper/added fat needed. Use about 1/2 thumb size grated or in smoothie. Turmeric has many diff types of curcuminoids vs reductionist supplements. There’s ~200 mg curcumin in 1tsp fresh or ground turmeric (varies a bit w/source or origins)

<COMMENT 7> i HAVE been using tumeric religiously since my strokes and my bouts with cancer and i am cancer free now, also have my blood pressure under control. I take mine with honey. I make the golden tumeric with organic honey </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> I cook everyday with curcuma and peper is it efficient. When cooked? </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Hats off to your integrity Doc. You're a real physician not the money monger like the majority. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> I am from Pakistan we cook our food with tumeric i use it in my green tea with lemon honey ginger sometimes garlic too and  cinnamon and for itchy throat mix it with honey and tumeric in hot or warm milk
Also every morning eat 2 to 3 dates empty stomach for energy
You can buy fresh tumeric from any Pakistani stores </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Raw roots of  turmeric has got a very strong but tasty. But eating them often you'll love it . </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Take Tumeric powder with oil or oily food and warm water for better absorblility in addition to black pepper </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> According to Ayurveda, the dosage is one half  teaspoon of turmeric mixed with warm water or milk with  pepper  . </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> very good quality for your video. so thank you.


I have benefited a lot from screaming. However, the service of this hospital is very good. The doctor saw the stream observing the distant patient. www.orbishealth.com </COMMENT 14>

<COMMENT 18> Guten Tag Herr Lesch,
Die Hochrechnung auf 5 Prozent 
Beatmungspflichtige ist falsch.
Infizierte und an Covid 19 Erkrankte dürfen nämlich nicht gleichgesetzt werden.
Diesen Fehler hat das RKI begangen.
Aber es erkranken nur 10 Prozent der Infizierten. Also müsste die 5 Prozent durch 10 dividiert werden, was 0.5 Prozent ergibt. Und selbst diese 0.5 Prozent sind noch zu hoch, denn nicht alle Erkrankte auf Intensivstationen bekommen eine Beatmung.
Das Gesundheitssystem war somit niemals auch nur annähernd gefährdet </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Harry, Du träumst doch nicht etwa immer noch von der Mondlandung  ?!? </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 5> Triste es que se utilise
Las muertes de la cotidianidad
Y para peor, hay algo más insólito y es que no dejan despedirse de sus seres queridos,
Eso causa indignación, 
El virus sí existe no lo niego
Y la verdad esto es algo que tiene colonizar el mundo,  lastimosamente algunas personas si morirán, pero no por que el virus sea letal, más bien mueren por que sus cuerpos son débiles, 
A la final respetes o no respetes la cuarentena saldrás contagiado 
Sea como sea lo vas adquirir 
Sea ahora 
O sea en un año o 2 quizá 4 
Gente  la solución está en cada uno de nosotros en lo personal,
Subir defensas y crear inmunidad

Estos medios quizá no son culpables,  sólo deben cumplir con un papel de teatro,  si no simplemente los despiden o perjudican el canal </COMMENT 5>

Si creo que hayan muertos  por esa enfermedad  pero  ahora  todos  es por covid19  que mueren  y las otras  enfermedades  y accidentes falta que salgan diciendo  que si muere  en un accidente  de  tránsito  también  salga positivo </COMMENT 8>

<COMMENT 13> Hay muchas cosas ocultas con eso de las muertes </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Eso es lo que querían los políticos sucios </COMMENT 14>

De estas personas, 97.306 fueron hombres y 79.293 mujeres; de acuerdo con la entidad estadística, las enfermedades crónicas respiratorias también provocaron el fallecimiento de 11.709 personas.

Otras de las enfermedades que hacen parte del listado son los tumores malignos (cáncer), la diabetes, las enfermedades hipertensivas y las enfermedades cerebrovasculares, añade el informe del Dañe.

<COMMENT 17> La historia detrás de los 1000 muertos es... muertos por enfermedades normales (cáncer, infartos, diabetes, etc) reportados como coronavirus. </COMMENT 17>

<COMMENT 2> Je rappelle juste que H1N1 faisait peur à l'époque tout comme le SRAS, le MERS et actuellement le COVID-19. Le problème, c'est que les trois précédents ont été géré de façon à ce qu'il n'y ait aucun confinement. Concernant le COVID-19,... C'est bien plus qu'un simple scandale d'État, c'est le Scandale du siècle.

Pour rappel, le SRAS de 2003 et le MERS de 1992 au Moyen Orient étaient aussi des coronavirus tout comme l'actuel COVID-19. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Bonjour,
Je suppose qu'on ne me lira pas, mais rien de grave, besoin d'écrire une pensée, une idée de faire.
Et si on élisait un anonyme au prochaine présidentielle qui démissionnerait dès sa prise de fonction. Puis se représenterait ensuite pour un deuxième mandat et redimensionnerait à nouveau. On présenterait toutes les 2 élections (2 mandats oblige) un nouveau candidat qui démissionnerait encore et encore jusqu'à ce que les autres décident enfin de laisser la place. Faire que le vote blanc deviennent concret.
Pendant les phases de démission, ce serait régions, départements, communes qui seraient à la barre (décentralisation forcée).
On m a souvent dit que pour changer les choses il fallait le faire de l'intérieur... pas évident, l'intérieur contamine ou désespère. Là, on leur enlèverait leur jouet jusqu'à ce qu'ils consentent à le prêter. Bloquer uniquement les joueurs du haut, laisser agir et penser ceux du bas.
Moi, je ne peux obtenir 500 signatures, pas assez connu. Mais je suis près à être cette anonyme et à ne pas parler au nom des français. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Hélas, le meilleur sujet traité depuis le début de cette période, et avec moult références! Pourquoi ne pas avoir titré simplement que le COVID 19 est une crise écologique?? C'est ce que je pense depuis le début; que ce virus soit naturel ou de synthèse, cela ne change rien à cet état de fait que presque personne n'ose souligner. Quant à mon interrogation sur ses origines, il est certain que les causes réelles seront longues à mettre en évidence... Toutefois, je pense que connaître l'information qui a fait paniquer l'ex-ministre de la santé est à rechercher en priorité (;-) </COMMENT 4>

<COMMENT 9> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPpoJGYlW54&t=336s Des animaux viennent du monde entier pour alimenter ces marchés industrialisés, de 54 ESPÈCES de bêtes sauvages. En 2004, cette industrie vaut 100 MILLIARDS de dollars. Très intéressant pour le gouvernement chinois. En 2018, cette industrie a atteinte 148 MILLIARDS de yuans. La Chine est exhortée à stopper ces marchés définitivement.
 Quatre mois après l'apparition du Covid-19 dans cette ville du centre du pays, les marchés de rue ont rouvert malgré une réputation sulfureuse qui leur vaut des appels à la fermeture depuis l'Australie ou encore les Etats-Unis. Si l'Organisation mondiale de la santé (OMS) a appelé les Etats à INTERDIRE la vente d'animaux sauvages, elle n'a pas plaidé pour la fermeture des marchés. https://information.tv5monde.com/video/coronavirus-en-chine-wuhan-rouvre-ses-marches </COMMENT 9>

<COMMENT 17> Terre fille du soleil
Boule de feu tu fu
Puis jaillit de l’espace la douche bienfaisante
La douche incessante des comètes chargées des prémices de la vie.
Du temps lourd de ces milliards d’années apparue le vivant
La mer fille de la terre fit du vivant le berceau 
De ce berceau naquit au point culminant de l’évolution : L’humanité
Puis ne cessa de croître et d’évoluer l’être humain en nombre et intelligence
Si nombreux et si peu respectueux qu’il fit dépérir le tissu vivant de la terre
Ce tissu que l’on nomme biodiversité avait été la mère nourricière de l’humanité passé
La mère terre se vengea sur ses enfants en vomissant des tempêtes, des ouragans et des virus
Fiévreuse elle pleura de la tête au pied des larmes de glaces fondantes
Sur le cimetière de l’humanité poussa alors la fleur de l’espoir 
Le signe avenir de l’harmonie naissante entre les humains ,les animaux et le monde végétal. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Que les chercheurs en biodiversité défendent leur emploi, je le comprend (même si ça ne relève pas des activités essentielles..) mais leur exploitation de l'émotion actuelle est particulièrement cynique. La peste, la variole, le choléra, la tuberculose (et j'en passe!) auprès desquelles le COVID19 est une plaisanterie, sont apparues à l'âge d'or de la biodiversité. La disparition de la peste est passée par l'éradication (partielle, hélas) des puces et poux. La leçon qu'on pourrait tirer de ce verbiage, c'est qu'avant d'aménager une zone naturelle, il faut éradiquer les espèces sauvages (notamment les chauve-souris!) qui s'y trouvent. </COMMENT 18>

Boost your immune system.

<COMMENT 6> Lol lies,lies,lies. There is no virus and so he is paid by the alt right as it seems like the majority of the"expert's" that showed up on YouTube. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Now bill gates started producing their vaccine PAID the doctors wt billons . So He can earned also more trillons . </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Lier </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> He is telling the truth! I also got well with the AZITHROMYCIN ANTIBIOTICS AND LOTS OF VITAMIN C. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> NEVER been a successful coronavirus vaccine. You are are a fucking moron if you line up for one. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Correction, this is NOT an especially lethal virus. Several studies have shown an IFR of 0.5% -- 0.25%, the range of the common flu. Stop the fear porn and get on with life. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Can you say probable biological modified virus? </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> How come that SARS stopped spread and SARS-Cov-2 doesn't stop? (in the desert like in Sweden for example)  Why?  I would like to have a good aswer to that. Why China doesn't want us to know about the patient zero? I would like to have a good anwser to that, too. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> I got maybe 2 mins in and then the guy said it's much more lethal  than other corona's which we now know is total bollocks. Sars 1 was much more lethal. This podcast can fuck off with its total nonsense. It's a new Flu and nothing else. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Doctor, I had read that a lab in Isreal was able to isolate a human protein that kills this virus. Is this true? </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Yeah i heared cov 19 use it as a body spray too . </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> no vaccine for sars, mers, herpes, cancer, aids, hiv, malaria, dengue, .... </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Yes daily high dose vitamin c good bye corona </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> I think that one of Korea's big secret is Kimchi, as it contains potent antiviral ingredients such as garlic, ginger, and chili.  WHO states that there is no clinical study that garlic helps so they dismiss the claim as myth.  But WHO has no evidence to the contrary, either.   And yes, there are molecular docking programs that show components in these foods can reduce virulence of SARS-COV-2.  It still appears as though a plant-based diet (great for reducing von Willebrand Factors associated with fatal COVID-19) combined with vitamin D3, NAC, zinc, quercetin, and alpha lipoic acid will help, although, admittedly, it's hard to get the $3B USD to prove it.  Why wait for a vaccine that might not be ready for many more months at the earliest? </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Why do they never talk about the need for the mass of humanity to get this virus and start building immunity? 

Why? 

Vaccines manufacturing companies?  

High tech companies wanting all of us to say imprisoned in our underwear doing Zoom video calls? 

Democrats to bring Donald T down? 

China-Russia axis to weaken USA? Facebook? All will be revealed by June 2021. 

The social unrest is just starting on this HOAX. Any trigger will ignite the fire of miserable people!! SAD world no? Aiyo what to do no? Aiyo!! </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 2> Looks like a massacre 🤨 </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> I am pleased for there recovery, but the truth is when you have a virus going around the best thing you can do is to get out in the fresh air and build your immune system up along with doses of Vitamins C  Vit D3 and Zinc. I feel upset for all those who have died because they haven't been able to access treatment for cancer e.t.c e.t.c and especially all the old folks being left to die of non covid and covid  illnesses because the doctors won't go in to treat them, it's like a mini holocaust going on, there old so who cares seems to be the attitude. </COMMENT 3>

<COMMENT 7> The title is misleading as usual. People don't just forget how to walk or breathe. Something is having difficulties but if u forgot how to breathe I'm pretty sure you'd be dead for starters. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> You would hope that a country with 66 million people, would have healthcare to take care of the corresponding amount of people that live in the country, without cancel life which is what this is all about.
A few people dying or getting the severe symptoms shouldn't result in a bloody war. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> More lies for the sheeple.
Give up media we know its all a scamdemic. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> If masks are so vital then why have we not got to wear them until the 15th? Or why have we not been ordered to wear them weeks ago? Or why are we not ordered to be wearing them now? Worked it out yet? Scamdemic.
This is coming from a "survivor" who did not die in February. 
In all likelihood it WAS a bad common cold or flu strain(s) that was weaponised by the government and then pushed as fearporn by the lamestream (owned) media.
No i am not a flat earther. I suspect its a globe but until i can actually see for myself then thats all it is. Tin foil hat? Conspiracy theorist? If you say so. But its a scamdemic unless i see otherwise. (Weeks later and so far no reason to doubt my view.) </COMMENT 10>

In that way I’m breathing in a positive thing and breathing away a negative thing. Otherwise, by doing the opposite, we would be taking into ourselves suffering and letting go of compassion. </COMMENT 14>

<COMMENT 1> I am so happy to see an MD who actually recognizes that natural remedies are effective and can play an integral part in primary prevention of disease, as well as a cure for disease in some circumstances. Being married to a Kashmiri, I have learned they add tumeric, red chili pepper powder, and black pepper powder to just about everything! </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Our family has been drinking Tumeric for many years, mix with other ingredients,  so many benefits... </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> I have a hard time swallowing something like that.  I also use Metamucil.  What I have found works great and a lot of people don't realize is you can get empty capsules and trays that let you manually fill 100 capsules at a time.  You only need to get the filling tray once and the capsules are real cheap. just google or search Amazon, I use amazon. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Warm Milk and turmeric combination is an excellent choice </COMMENT 4>

<COMMENT 6> @3:17 earlier studied show 1.6g or <1tsp turmeric spice effective for anti cancer effects. Also root has natural oils so no pepper/added fat needed. Use about 1/2 thumb size grated or in smoothie. Turmeric has many diff types of curcuminoids vs reductionist supplements. There’s ~200 mg curcumin in 1tsp fresh or ground turmeric (varies a bit w/source or origins)

<COMMENT 7> i HAVE been using tumeric religiously since my strokes and my bouts with cancer and i am cancer free now, also have my blood pressure under control. I take mine with honey. I make the golden tumeric with organic honey </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> I cook everyday with curcuma and peper is it efficient. When cooked? </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Hats off to your integrity Doc. You're a real physician not the money monger like the majority. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> I am from Pakistan we cook our food with tumeric i use it in my green tea with lemon honey ginger sometimes garlic too and  cinnamon and for itchy throat mix it with honey and tumeric in hot or warm milk
Also every morning eat 2 to 3 dates empty stomach for energy
You can buy fresh tumeric from any Pakistani stores </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Raw roots of  turmeric has got a very strong but tasty. But eating them often you'll love it . </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Take Tumeric powder with oil or oily food and warm water for better absorblility in addition to black pepper </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> According to Ayurveda, the dosage is one half  teaspoon of turmeric mixed with warm water or milk with  pepper  . </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> very good quality for your video. so thank you.


I have benefited a lot from screaming. However, the service of this hospital is very good. The doctor saw the stream observing the distant patient. www.orbishealth.com </COMMENT 14>

<COMMENT 18> Guten Tag Herr Lesch,
Die Hochrechnung auf 5 Prozent 
Beatmungspflichtige ist falsch.
Infizierte und an Covid 19 Erkrankte dürfen nämlich nicht gleichgesetzt werden.
Diesen Fehler hat das RKI begangen.
Aber es erkranken nur 10 Prozent der Infizierten. Also müsste die 5 Prozent durch 10 dividiert werden, was 0.5 Prozent ergibt. Und selbst diese 0.5 Prozent sind noch zu hoch, denn nicht alle Erkrankte auf Intensivstationen bekommen eine Beatmung.
Das Gesundheitssystem war somit niemals auch nur annähernd gefährdet </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Harry, Du träumst doch nicht etwa immer noch von der Mondlandung  ?!? </COMMENT 19>

Being married to a Kashmiri, I have learned they add tumeric, red chili pepper powder, and black pepper powder to just about everything! </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Our family has been drinking Tumeric for many years, mix with other ingredients,  so many benefits... </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> I have a hard time swallowing something like that.  I also use Metamucil.  What I have found works great and a lot of people don't realize is you can get empty capsules and trays that let you manually fill 100 capsules at a time.  You only need to get the filling tray once and the capsules are real cheap. just google or search Amazon, I use amazon. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Warm Milk and turmeric combination is an excellent choice </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> 9 </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> @3:17 earlier studied show 1.6g or <1tsp turmeric spice effective for anti cancer effects. Also root has natural oils so no pepper/added fat needed. Use about 1/2 thumb size grated or in smoothie. Turmeric has many diff types of curcuminoids vs reductionist supplements. There’s ~200 mg curcumin in 1tsp fresh or ground turmeric (varies a bit w/source or origins)

<COMMENT 7> i HAVE been using tumeric religiously since my strokes and my bouts with cancer and i am cancer free now, also have my blood pressure under control. I take mine with honey. I make the golden tumeric with organic honey </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> I cook everyday with curcuma and peper is it efficient. When cooked? </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Hats off to your integrity Doc. You're a real physician not the money monger like the majority. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> I am from Pakistan we cook our food with tumeric i use it in my green tea with lemon honey ginger sometimes garlic too and  cinnamon and for itchy throat mix it with honey and tumeric in hot or warm milk
Also every morning eat 2 to 3 dates empty stomach for energy
You can buy fresh tumeric from any Pakistani stores </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Raw roots of  turmeric has got a very strong but tasty. But eating them often you'll love it . </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Take Tumeric powder with oil or oily food and warm water for better absorblility in addition to black pepper </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> According to Ayurveda, the dosage is one half  teaspoon of turmeric mixed with warm water or milk with  pepper  . </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> very good quality for your video. so thank you.


I have benefited a lot from screaming. However, the service of this hospital is very good. The doctor saw the stream observing the distant patient. www.orbishealth.com </COMMENT 14>

<COMMENT 16> Sir should we take this in summer? </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Take care Doc, the pharma guys gonna come after you. They might even come up with a bogus claim ... 'Turmeric is hazardous to human in the long run, according to some mad scientist' </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Take cod liver oil </COMMENT 18>

<COMMENT 9> 3rd world countries in other words are targeted.  Instead of missiles they use infected vaccines (biological warfare).
Geriatric scientists only concern is to kill many it seems.
Genocide with no repercussions
because the people will either be dead or immune compromised.

<COMMENT 11> 33 min in, can't watch anymore. Very one sided. Older men still coming from the box, working for academia. If I had high blood pressure and the ONLY way I could reduce it was with drugs, that would be stunting the expansion of consciousness. There are many ways. The very first way would be change your thinking, be aware of perceptions and change them. Amit Goswami: "We all have the habit of thinking that everything around us is already a thing existing without my input, without my choice. You have to banish that kind of thinking." And "Instead of thinking of things, you have to think of possibilities." </COMMENT 11>

<COMMENT 13> How many pandemics have these two worked through. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> I did just read a comment that mutant sequence of the virus show that the virus originated from USA. Now I see that guys video was taken down. I go back again and he's comment was deleted. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Is there any kind of drug free intervention so as to increase our body system to bugs. ..?at least if there a group for vaccine solution there should also be a health food intervention at the same time..? </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> The bugs attack our immune system, there’s a lot of frontline nurses died. If they look after those nurses they probably still alive. But they work too much some more than 12 hours. The immune system is down while working. And we all know that if a person is tired, chance of getting sick is high. You worry too much about the vaccine where you should be looking after people to boost more the immune system. I hope with theses prediction of the second wave, please help people to boost their immune system, while searching for the vaccine. Start telli people the best food to take for their system. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> great video </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> I like your channel. It’s amazing that people who enjoy a good life are worried about regular people being accustomed to 40hrs a week. If you are a business owner, the biggest scare is people won’t show up for any reason to make “your” dreams come true. It’s amazing! </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> A virus infecting 0,26%....and staying blind for the adult autoimmune virus and the child autoimmune virus in the US, the first 60% and the second 54%, how can we go back to normal from this???? </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 18> Guten Tag Herr Lesch,
Die Hochrechnung auf 5 Prozent 
Beatmungspflichtige ist falsch.
Infizierte und an Covid 19 Erkrankte dürfen nämlich nicht gleichgesetzt werden.
Diesen Fehler hat das RKI begangen.
Aber es erkranken nur 10 Prozent der Infizierten. Also müsste die 5 Prozent durch 10 dividiert werden, was 0.5 Prozent ergibt. Und selbst diese 0.5 Prozent sind noch zu hoch, denn nicht alle Erkrankte auf Intensivstationen bekommen eine Beatmung.
Das Gesundheitssystem war somit niemals auch nur annähernd gefährdet </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Harry, Du träumst doch nicht etwa immer noch von der Mondlandung  ?!? </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 2> People are so stupid and foolish... </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Because they're not controlling themselves are doing anything properly all they are doing is destroying hurting innocent people and their livelihoods. All the police are not to blame. There is a few badge apples that need to be removed but there's also incredible police officers out there. And this idiot's are out there without mask. Not only putting themselves in danger but played others at risk. I have seen so many children being brought out to these protest and it is truly heartbreaking what they're teaching our next generation. Along with the fact that they could be hurt and I truly believe it is child abuse. </COMMENT 3>

Meanwhile people still can’t meet in churches or any large gatherings except those in agreement with our PMs way of thinking!  The only one I bow down to is Jesus  Christ. All these people on one knee look like they are worshipping. But it’s not God. George Floyd’s family doesn’t seem to like it either and I respect them for it. </COMMENT 6>

<COMMENT 12> Our mainstream media, aren't they so wonderful to watch! Now we're again concern about the pandemic/ virus now that it will begin to kill off more our senior citizens. Did all you protestors go into self isolation for 14 days?? Don't want to go kill your grandma and grandpa with a visit!!  Only two or three weeks ago all this concern with meat packing employees and our long term care senior citizens working or living in clusters. But it's all ok to go and protest in very large groups.

<COMMENT 14> These same lame experts wanted the anti lockdown protesters to be crucified, but are soft on these gatherings.  This suggests the threat was not real for the healthy population and that politics is at play. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> wanna be friends? </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Stop giving this attention.  It's weak minded people that dont even agree on what they are protesting or what they even want.   Millions of Canadians suffering with high debt and no jobs.  That should be front page news everyday until it's fixed.  This is a distraction driven by a political agenda. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> just more fear  and langauge  warning on global  news  , netflix have done this for  the show zoo.  and it is not real </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Let's be honest, there are no "experts" there are speculators and propagandists. The journalists are clearly on the propagandist side. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Latest WHO article. Wearing a mask MAY prevent catching it in a Moderate way but wearing it WILL cause shortness of breath, headaches,  immune issues. </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 11> 33 min in, can't watch anymore. Very one sided. Older men still coming from the box, working for academia. If I had high blood pressure and the ONLY way I could reduce it was with drugs, that would be stunting the expansion of consciousness. There are many ways. The very first way would be change your thinking, be aware of perceptions and change them. Amit Goswami: "We all have the habit of thinking that everything around us is already a thing existing without my input, without my choice. You have to banish that kind of thinking." And "Instead of thinking of things, you have to think of possibilities." </COMMENT 11>

<COMMENT 14> I did just read a comment that mutant sequence of the virus show that the virus originated from USA. Now I see that guys video was taken down. I go back again and he's comment was deleted. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Is there any kind of drug free intervention so as to increase our body system to bugs. ..?at least if there a group for vaccine solution there should also be a health food intervention at the same time..? </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> The bugs attack our immune system, there’s a lot of frontline nurses died. If they look after those nurses they probably still alive. But they work too much some more than 12 hours. The immune system is down while working. And we all know that if a person is tired, chance of getting sick is high. You worry too much about the vaccine where you should be looking after people to boost more the immune system. I hope with theses prediction of the second wave, please help people to boost their immune system, while searching for the vaccine. Start telli people the best food to take for their system. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> great video </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> I like your channel. It’s amazing that people who enjoy a good life are worried about regular people being accustomed to 40hrs a week. If you are a business owner, the biggest scare is people won’t show up for any reason to make “your” dreams come true. It’s amazing! </COMMENT 18>

<COMMENT 1> Thank you Gary and David! Well done and much appreciated. 👍🙏🦷😷👊😎 </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Scientific evidence? </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> A dental office I worked in last week told me the KN95 came from Henry Schein. There was no Niosh and it was earloops from a small importer in New York. The box says it is being made for SHL Safety Inc of which has no website or internet presence. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Schein just wants to market themselves. Stop taking advantage of the dental profession during an emergency pandemic. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Need state testing, recommendations on implementation of appropriate air purification systems per square foot, certification of IAQC annually under DEEP like Radiation Certifications under DEEP. REGULATORY OVERSIGHT BY STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES. Every Office Must Comply by 2021. That’s what I’m advocating for all of us on a state and federal level. Take care of the aerosol issue and we are all set! </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> What about the circulation ( and recirculation) of air throughout the whole office by the AC system.  Are air purifiers of any value? </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Will you address how to contain aerosol at the site of its generation?  I've seen suction systems. </COMMENT 7>

<COMMENT 2> How to get in English!!!! </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> I started advocating for face masks for ordinary people in February- & even now in June wearing a face mask is frowned on in Florida. 
Medical Professionals need N95 but a 50 cent blue surgical mask worn by the ordinary person will provide a level of protection when social distancing is difficult. PROBLEM in USA - no PPE for our medical workers & finding a face mask of any type for seniors & at risk was impossible until recently. We were totally unprepared and our culture rejects wearing a face mask.  Hopefully that will change, but if we had adopted the preventive measures of South Korea & other Asia countries from the getgo, I believe our infections would not be topping 1.8 million with 300,000 deaths. Truly tragic. </COMMENT 3>

<COMMENT 19> 17:08 America was short of masks in March because the Chinese withheld crucial information about the Wuhan CCP virus from the world while they sucked up all the high quality 3M N-95 masks and other PPE they could get their filthy hands on from the US and elsewhere to protect themselves before their dirty secret got out to the world!!! </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 1> McDonalds workers=McSlaves </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> The hypocrisy, this demonstration of social awareness and caring drives me mad. If they really gave a shit maybe they could advice consumers that during this pandemic a healthier choice, full of vitamins and nutrients in order to boost your immune system is the way to go. But no, they do care. About their bottom line. And all these companies are doing the same, taking people for brainless idiots. Swallow the crap they shovel down your throat, over pay for it and keep smiling. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> McDonald's home of the none burger 🍔 lol you know that's not beef we were already risking our health 😂 we haven't eaten there in 2 years </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Pray for Trump's death folks! 🙏 </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> People of the world, Boycott Mac donald stay healthy ! </COMMENT 5>

<COMMENT 7> Normally I eat the ice cream cone (I m not sure it is the right word... I mean the cookie). Anyway, the guy here is touching it, bare hands. And then the woman puts a napkin on it...easy way to transmit it </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> WHAT A JOKE! This whole Covid thing is a big HOAX of a Joke. People wearing masks and social distancing look stupid and silly as F. All of this for a virus that has a 0.01% Death Rate. ABSOLUTE JOKE and CNN is an ABSOLUTE KLoWn show. </COMMENT 8>

<COMMENT 1> Now these nurses and doctors are joining rallies what a bunch of hypocrites. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> 3 weeks later these SAME nurses are in BLM protests   LMAO </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Those are some strong willed-Nurses. I'm glad we have people like them in America </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> And now the coronavirus is gone, and was apparently cured by George Floyd </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> They don't mind walking out on their patients to protest now though? </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Trump 2020 </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> So if they get ill don’t treat the protesters. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> FAKE.  Over 1000 health care professionals have signed a letter approving of the BLM protests but still condemning the Mich. protesters. Social distancing only matters when it's a pro-Trump protest. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> So funny how this was the narrative then as soon as the Protest started all your viewpoints change, your sheep to the the system and are so quick to jump onto the next victimhood culture </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Glad I’m not American </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Thank God for all the hero nurses out there changing bedpans and making Tik Tok videos, saving lives. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Denmark stands with you! help the nurses, respect the nurses... respect those who help <3 </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Your freedom of speech and other freedoms stop when they put others at risk or infringe on someone else's rights. Im a free speech absolutist and a second amendment absolutist unless you're a violent felon etc, but I was crying for martial law in every county..the majority of the country could have been back up and running months ago had we locked down 'airtight' immediately. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> I'm literally for a trump supporter to come and say something idiotic in the comments. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Wait till one of them catch the virus and go to the hospital where they see the nurse they harassed and the nurse says NOPE OUT </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> is it bad that when the dude who made the Facebook post got corona and died I yelled "karma sucks doesn't it" </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> it's ok to leave your house now! </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> These people grew old but they didn't grow up </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Every single one if them are gonna get covid-19 </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Why are nurses even attending the protests barley anyone is following proper guidelines they suppose to be in the hospitals saving people ? Instead they take a big chance contracting a virus in large groups </COMMENT 20>

Its only natural la kan to feel like we are going under. Good thing la doctor kita ni bagus bagitau lg pasal pecahan kluster and everything, calmly.

<COMMENT 1> message de Didier Rahoult aujourd'hui le 8 avril  @ </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Le ministre de la MORT veut attendre 2 semaines de plus. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Bonjour je suis fier du résultat et je pense que le professeur Raoul  doit profiter de cette crise pour démasquer le mansonge sur le VIH
Je que le professeur connais aussi le traitement pour libérer des milliers de personnes sous ARV </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Et les familles des victimes attendent la fin de cette épidémie pour trainer les responsables au gouvernement en justice </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Les tests engagés par l'état de l'hydroxychloroquine ne suivent pas le même processus tels que le professeur Raoult les préconisent. Les autorités parlent déjà qu'ils seront négatifs alors qu'ils n'ont pas le résultat final. En effet comme l’espèce de ministre qu'on a l'a affirmé, il autorise le traitement mais Uniquement pour les cas Graves, alors que le professeur Raoult a bien précisé que ce traitement ne faisait que réduire voir stopper la prolifération du virus dans notre corps et donc évitait la contamination entre patients ce qui enrayerait la maladie, et qu'il devait être administré au début de la maladie et si possible dès sa détection. Le traitement ne fonctionneras pas dans ce sens. Donc Encore un gros foutage de gueule, ceci n'est plus de l'incompétence, c'est Volontaire, cela fait bien partie d'un Plan. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Ce que l'on voit est la realite mais ce que l'on nous dit est un mensonge . </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> On parle que la 5g pourrait être le responsable de ce virus </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Vous êtes fou si ca marche pourquoi le monde est parslyser? Les francais sont tèlement idiot ils croivent à m' importe quoi. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Ministre de la santé est un gros tocard il a utiliser une fake news pour discréditer la chloroquine en disant qu’il y avait eu un mort au usa alors que sait faux ce gouvernement a jeter à la poubelle </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Ce professeur est soit considéré comme le diable soit comme un dieu. Bon, il faudrait peut-être trouver un juste milieu. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Vivement le grand ménage de tous ces incompétents. Ils vont avoir bcp de morts sur le dos et devront rendre des comptes </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Les journalistes d'RMC qui se croient à l'abri de la colère du peuple dans leur tour d'ivoire...
Vous allez, comme le gouvernement prendre très cher quand cette merde sera terminée.
Allez tous vous faire enculer </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> y'a 1 témoignage, n'en faisont pas une réalité.
"J'ai le COVID-19, et j'ai étais soigné en 6 heures en mangeant le bois de mon escalier " peut-on en faire une généralité ? , va t-on prescrire du bois aux infectés ? un témoignage seul ne vaut rien. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> 15 jour c est environs ( 5 jour x 250 mort/jour  [=1250]     ).   +    (5 jour x    550 mort/jour   [ =2750]      ).    +    (5 jour     x     800  [ = 4000   ).    =   8000  +   les 1300 (deja mort )      =9300         sans compté les malade décedé en EHPAD et a domicle  ne son pas comptabilisé      dans 15 jours c est possible qu soit autour  10.000  mort. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> 15 jour pour etudié comment decrediliser son medicament surtout </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Le ministre de la santé veut attendre 20 000 morts supplémentaires pour donner son feu vert. Dans le même temps il y aura tellement de demande, l'Inde par exemple que le traitement ne sera plus disponible. </COMMENT 16>

<COMMENT 3> I love Singapore 💕💕💕 </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> With all due respect Mr.Lee, majority is not really afraid of the virus but are afraid of job loss. Well renowned doctors around the world are raising their voices stating that the Covid virus is very less severe to justify a lockdown. There are many news media those are caught staging drama to falsely portray hospitals as a war zone. For e.g CBS news got caught by faking a Covid testing site as busy. There are voices from well renowned people that this Covid lockdown is an international scam to destroy the current economic system and build a new one with digital currency. Plus push mandatory vaccines to kill off a significant percentage of global population. Because the global elites are concerned about population being high. Hence, there remains a suspicion that a percentage of those that get a Covid vaccine shot is either going to lose their fertility or end up dead after a few years later. Some would say this to be conspiracy theory but this lockdown was also a prediction of a past so called conspiracy theory. So, Mr.Lee please involve some Singapore based researchers to study the disease Covid and make our own conclusion instead of blindly believing what WHO says. They got an agenda sir. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> If they follow China, Singapore will have zero cases now. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Compared with the content of PM Lee's speech and the speech of a minister whose analysis mask is composed of six parts ....not long ago, the mindset of both of them that are too far apart. The PM is courageous for the goal, however....,  but, the minister has been kept on looking for the constraints/difficulties of masks making.....! </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> what's the bet the hong kong and taiwan implosion will help singapore? </COMMENT 7>

<COMMENT 9> The Countries with High Fatality Rate over COVID-19: Be Aware of the Health Risks of High Blood Sugar Levels 
https://beeigood.com/blog/post/coronavirus-natural-treatment-update </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> The story should be like that a group of celebrities have their rules to share the advantage of the world, CCP predented to be obedient to obey their rules to work for them till CCP gets powerful and clever and ambitious to announce CCP would like to be the big boss and refuse to share anything with them then no other bosses would like to accept CCP  so CCP incite all poor people to fight against their gov then CCP could take the great advantage from the chaos coz the US powerful military forces would like to be in vain. Remember CCP is the worst boss so all human beings are now used by CCP and finally will be slaved by CCP with CCP 's unique military forces.  And CCP won't take any responsibility which your  government is taking. Then doom will arrive. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Im more concerned as to why he did not drink his holy water. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Thank you Mr Lee for such an inspiring, assuring and realistic speech to the nation.. You are a great leader and we need someone like you in this time of uncertain Covid crisis ... Currently I noticed many provision shops in neighbourhood area selling household, electronics and bargain products still remain shut under this phase 1 period ... Please allow it to be opened as quickly as possible cos many of this items are essentials for daily usage and cannot be found in Ntuc, Shengshiong and Giant ... Please Mr Lee help us to get this stores open ... God bless SG... </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> entire time i was waiting for phase 2 date... </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> He is the best PM in S'pore right now. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> I have been appealing from your PM office, repeatedly.

That me and my familieshave been issued a notice of eviction from my landlord due to CoviD stay home. When are you going to help me ? Been asking upteen times. I got no job , no money and soon becomes homeless. 

So help me please. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> 民為邦本， we are Not xenophobic. Just too many. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> We should not be buying the F-35s, it will save us a lot of money.  Firstly stealth doesn't really apply to our assumed enemies, F-35 is only good for long distance engagement and sucks at dogfights.  Either the SU-57 or the J20 will be better for our case. Secondly a lot of countries buy F-35 because some of the parts will be manufactured in that country but for us, it is almost nil.  If not to upset the balance between US and China relationships, think we should just still focus on the F-16V or something similar to that. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> P/m i has buy a 2 room bot and taking the key on end of this months but because of covid 19 i has losse my jod and i loans from hdb because of this i cant give me loans and i need this house p/m can u please heep me can thanks </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Trust your government will look after you. They will get you a job or give you a grant. Just be a good citizen, download your Covid app, wear your tracker and take your vaccine. Oh and don't forget to wear your mask. But whatever you do don't think for yourself and god forbid don't wake up. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Has he mentioned anything about launching an inquiry into the foreign workers' dorms? We got like over 10,000 cases from there? 
What happened to the quarantine plan at the dorms? MP Tan Chuan Jin debated this before in Parliament in 2015.
Where is the commissioner for foreign employee dormitories?
Why has MP Josephine Teo not apologised? She said something about you don't need a lot of space to multiply?
And MP Chan Chun Seng, masks are good, why did he scorn HK for wearing masks. Is he a scientist?
And where are the swab test kits? It has been four months since our first case. 
So no talk about making more babies then?
But NDP must go on?
And elections still all green?
S. Korea was able to hold its elections well because i) test kits ii) masks, and iii) contact tracing. Sg only has contact tracing. 
So many questions... </COMMENT 20>

Si vous n'avez rien appris avec ma vidéo je suis pour une fois content, ça voudra dire que vous avez compris l'enjeu actuel. bon visionnage et faites attentions a vous ! </COMMENT 1>

<COMMENT 6> Crise économique... 
Perte de confiance envers le gouvernement... 
Économie qui passe devant la santé...

Moi je dit après le covid 19 le monde va changer profiter de vos proches on sait jamais </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Moi c’est pas le corona virus qui m’a fait peur, mais les gens. 
Regarder en Amérique il ont commencé à acheter des armes. 
Pourquoi ? Alors la aller leur demandez. 
Ou encore ( là je rigole pas c’est vraiment vrai ), les forces de l’ordre observent nos moindres déplacement, parce que comme des idiots, ont mais sur Facebook : est regarder aujourd’hui je suis ici. 
Ah oui et l’école. 
enfaite les enfants ont les prends pour des fourmis. 
On leur fais un carré, et on leur dit: ne dépasse pas se carré. 
C’est inquiétant pour leurs sociabilisation avec les autres personnes. 
Enfaite ont leurs apprend à devenir insociable. 
Le président. 
Rhooo sa va il a dit comme pour cernoville ( je sais pas comment ça s’écrit ), il a pas le passeport, il peut pas passer les frontières. Mais bien sûr.
😑eh bien voilà maintenant ou ont en est. 
Est le gouvernement il va se servir comme excuse du coronavirus, de rajouter des restrictions ridicules. Comme la liberté d’expression des chaîne YouTube, ex: byoblu. Qui t’informe sur des choses, qu’à la télé tu n’entendra jamais . 
Et bien sûr il essaye par tout les moyen de les fermer c’est chaîne YouTube .
Bon il y’en a tellement, elles vont pas se fermer de si tôt .
Enfaite, je ne veux pas vous critiquer puisque je me critique moi même,
Ont a été un peu trop crédules sur se coup là. 
Ons est même pas sûre que le de nombre de mort est vrai. Même si ( il a été approuvé par un étudiant de Harvard )
Il y’en a qui peut même être mort d’autre chose.
Ne me critiquer pas. 
Juste donner votre avis, faite vous votre opinion de cette situation.
Est c’est pas pour gratter des likes, c’est juste pour donné mon point de vue. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> "Nous serons en confinement total pendant 2 semaines comme en Italie" BAHAHAHA ça fait 2 mois :issou: </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Tu balayes bcp de théories dans l'intro sans arguments c'est pas un travail d'enquête ça </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Toi qui a déjà produit une très bonne vidéo sur Casasnovas, serait-il possible de parler du cancer que lui et ses pôtes (Schaller, Crèvecoeur, etc...) sont en train de répandre sur internet? Je suis extrêmement inquiète de voir les absurdités qu'ils répandent être adoptées et partagées par des gens, hier encore, raisonnables...
Ces malades ont gagné une audience phénoménale pendant le confinement. Si toi tu t'attaques au sujet, ça pourrait contre-balancer... </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> à quand ep 2 sur le déconfinement ? </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> nautre  gouvernement  c'est  de la merde  wola  on dit  au  français  de respect  les  distance   de sécurité alors  que personne  respecte les disance   de sécurité  alors  que  le  peuple  sans  branle   notre gouvernement  est  torp  lacsicte   on est foutu  c'est moi qui  vous le dit    le peuple  français  sont  cons  on leur  dit de respecter  les  règles   le  peuple  fais  tout  le  contraire  
est il bon nous  enculer  a  sec  le 11 mais    on est foutu  c'est moi qui  vous le  dit   parceque  le peuple est  cons (des putin  de moutons) pour la plus pare .... </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Loll Arrête c'est juste une grippe pas la peste noire... Comme à chaque grippe saisonnière il y a des morts c normal malheureusement. La question est de savoir s'ils vont nous mettre tous en confinement à chaque fois qu'il y a une grippe... Ou à chaque soulèvement social important. "Un peuple qui est prêt à sacrifier un peu de liberté pour un peu de sécurité ne mérite ni un ni l'autre et finira par perdre les deux." -Benjamin Franklin </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Etant dans le milieu médical et paramédical, j'ai accès directe de ce qu'il se passe dans les hôpitaux, laboratoires, cliniques....etc par des collègues ou des amis. Je peux vous assure que même si vous êtes jeune et en bonne santé, le virus ne vas pas vous épargnez pour autant. Pensez à votre entourage mais aussi aux personnel soignants qui sont se sacrifie littéralement pour la population qui semble s'en foutre complètement. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> ce qui est egoiste cest de reduire la qualité de vie de 8 milliard de personne pour quelques personne a risque, cest eux le probleme pas nous </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Tu avais raison en vrai </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> merci de ta vidéo, c'est là ou l"on voit la mentalité de la plus part des français qu'ils ne regardent que leur propre nombril,car oui cette épidémie va faire très mal en santé et économiquement  car pour certaines personnes le confinement durera jusqu'à l'apparition d'un traitement et l'économie risque de mettre pas mal de temps à reprendre ,c'est pire que le crac boursier de 2007 et cela touche le monde entier les frontières ne seront pas ouvertes sitôt,et la seule préoccupation de nos concitoyen c'est de pouvoir partir en vacances cet été et que les bars et restaurants ré-ouvrent,enfin merci à toi mais pour l'instant j'ai du mal avoir la sortie du tunnel à+ </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Je m'eppelle Mathilde on on s'en fou ai 11 ans j'ai même pas commencer ma vie que on doi plus sortir et pire les enfant qui vienne de n'être 😂😂😂😂 </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> OK le virus à pris une ampleur énorme au niveau mondial depuis ce temps, c'est impressionnant
Cependant quand on regarde les statistiques et le profil des personnes ayant des symptomes graves voir des personnes décédés, je n'ai pas vraiment peur de l'attraper.
Je respecte bien évidemment les règles de confinement et d'hygiène pour mes proches et pour les autres, mais ce virus ne me fait pas stresser... </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> J'ai 10 ans et je suis diabètique esque je devrais avoir peur ne plus sortir 😷🤔 </COMMENT 20>

<TITLE> The Great Ventilator Fiasco of COVID19 | Are They Even Needed? Doctor Explains </TITLE>

<TIMESTAMP> 2020-04-24T13:46:41Z </TIMESTAMP>
<DESCRIPTION> First we're told we need thousands of ventilators. Now they might be hurting more than helping? How does this relate to the biggest challenge facing science ... </DESCRIPTION>

<COMMENT 1> We've been wasting our time with ventilators when all we needed was Dettol down our throats and a UV torch up the bum. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> news flash, doctors are killing people, every hr of every day. I was unlucky and got ran over by a young girl to busy on her phone to watch the road while she was driving. I've spent the last 6 years going to idiots, and I'm being as nice as I can be, I'm left with the opinion that most doctors are complete assholes who are worried about a multitude of things and the patient is very low on this list. I've been laughed at, I've been chastised, I've been belittled by arrogant assholes, most I wouldnt let look at my cat. so Elon might have some valid points but like all other doctors they are to busy saying " how dare you tell me anything, dont you know who I am" and this is their problem, our scientists are also idiots who cant get much right </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Hey doc. Could you do a video on the importance of eating healthy foods and living healthy lifestyles in the 'fight' against viruses please? </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> My comment was reading ‘Drowning ‘ the person. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> I added a comment to the ventilator use at the beginning of this outbreak.  Basically, you got to high altitude, you need to acclimatise for some time to allow the change. Ie. Thirst is not relieved by drawing the person. We are tough but no so that we can get a big pressure forced into our lungs ,suddenly.  At altitude, you must get oxygen. At 5he or near normal you are used to. It’s common logic. What comes from our nose daily, our oxygen inlet, makes a crust of it, in airways. Is It can not help the membrane between lung to  blood. Cut yourself, it forms a scab. That started as a ‘clot’. Well well , how did that happen? Logic, no one knows about logic, ‘experts’ ? </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Elon might have just been putting out feelers for correction.
In my opinion,  it was a peer review request, not a self promotion.
It promoted discussion and helped his engineers.
This is a team effort. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Talking about conspiracy theories how do you explain this? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5h8LnyCKok&feature=share
https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/887467/25-options-for-increasing-adherence-to-social-distancing-measures-22032020.pdf </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> I love this video very helpful In explaining these issue also the intro was hilarious </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> I got two important conclusions from this presentation (although I knew those already, it provided a powerful confirmation):
1) The WWW has led to the democratization of knowledge as well as stupidity. It takes an acute critical sense to make one's way through this jungle).
And:
2) Some people cannot cope with fame, which can make otherwise genuinely talented people look pretty bad. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> We hear this all the time, people with very little education on the subject know more than the Doctors and scientists. How that is the case I have no idea.

Elon Musk made a submarine, I believe, to get some boys in Thailand out some flooded caves. He didn't grasp the problem then either. Stick with batteries Elon, you are considered an expert on those, don't challenge people who have a better grasp of the situation than you! </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Your ridiculing of President Trump is specious and unfair. I no longer respect you. I have met with dozens of physicians and surgeons who are with the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons and they feel no need to criticize our oresident whom they think is doing well considering that  he has been advised by those who stand to benefit vaccine manufacturers. https://aapsonline.org/ </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> I agree with u </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> The good physician treats the disease; the great physician treats the patient who has the disease. Quoted from William Osler. In the second class are those, like Dr. Thomas Yadegar, who saw the patient as an individual and developed a cure for COVID-19. It (the cure) is staring you doctors right in the face and you can't or won't have the guts to try it yourselves. You are stuck in the "ventilator rut". By nature, human beings are creatures of habit. We don't like change. But, please change your standard treatment plan for the small subset of COVID-19 patients that would normally require ventilators. Investigate Dr. Yadegar's alternative treatment for COVID-19 and I bet you will see that you may view it as more trouble than ventilators, simply because you may see it as something that you are unfamiliar with.  I need to put out a spoiler here: part of it is counterintuitive. But, it works to save those patients who are now dying on ventilators. Doctors prime directive is "First, do no harm." Google "Dr. Thomas Yadegar and the cure for COVID-19" and see that what he proposes is simply a better and more humane cure. A recording of Dr. Yadegar discussing his cure is available online at the news section for the news of April 28, 2020 on the Glenn Beck radio show website (USA). In a experimental treatment for COVID-19 patients on ventilators at Providence Cedars-Sinai Tarzana Medical Center, doctors are using UV light delivered through a tube to lung tissues to kill the virus. And, there is a new book that I think is very relevant to managing the immune system problems with some of the COVID-19 patients: Cytokine Storm Syndrome by Drs. Randy Cron and Edward Behrens (Springer, 2019) which is described by the publisher as "...a playbook for stopping the deadly Cytokine Storm Syndrome". Doctors, I hope that I have provided enough new ideas about treating COVID-19 that I have helped to get you out of the "ventilator rut", when and if you can. Like I said before, change comes difficult for us humans. Most times we are creatures of habit (and hospital  guidelines, in the case of doctors, of course). Nothing will change until more doctors propose change to their department heads.  Will change happen? Dr. Yadegar's  protocol has been in the public domain since April 1, 2020 when NBC TV NEWS aired the story of his remarkable groundbreaking approach to CURE the virus. Why hasn't it spread like wildfire? While we are waiting on a vaccine, people are still dying with COVID-19. Yadegar's protocol can begin to dramatically lower the death rate worldwide, if adopted. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> No such thing as “anti” vaxxer. Former vaxxers yes. Vaccine ingredients Informed, yes. Why are you in my  suggestions? </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> There is now a 100% cure for COVID-19 without respirators/ventilators demonstrated by Dr. Thomas Yadegar, ICU Director at Providence Cedars-Sinai Tarzana Medical Center in California USA. A recording of an interview with Dr. Yadegar discussing his protocol is available online at the news section for the news of April 28, 2020 on the Glenn Beck radio show website (USA). please help spread the word. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Your premise is that doctors know absolutely everything and Hereford shouldn’t be questioned. When sailors came back from the Dutch West Indies having had their scabies treated successfully with pineapple by the indigenous people the scoffed at the suggestion and it took Bout 150 years for the idea to be given any credence.  Considering medical training hasn’t. Hanged since the end of the 19 th century, I think it would be quite a reasonable thing for doctors ato be more open to brilliant minds like Elon Musk. A lot of useful ideas. One from brainstorming ideas. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Science is always a political creature, but when scientists and technicians lose their faculties of patience, humility, wisdom, and other classic virtues, we risk losing our path to the truth, which is our only salvation in a pandemic. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> 13:30 Yes. Yes. This, so much. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Seeing Medlife refer to SciShow as "ever-excellent" makes me happy </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> UR a bit of a cog. U can study procedures & drugs so much, until you’ve let so many perish. Lead, follow or get the f out of the way. Prophylactic use.of HCQ should be done ASAP. India is doing it. Might not be a 1 year intensive study to deduce. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 1> Hello Dr.Duc C. Vuong, thank you for the informative  information... </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Hi! This was very informative and the information is still applicable it seems (June 4). Thanks.

I had COVID19 type symptoms in mid-March, though I tested negative. Don't know if it was just out of my system or I had something else. Anyway,  this information prompted me to be sure to use asthma medications (inhaled): corticosteroid to keep inflammation down.  My physician eventually put me on Montelukast, which is great for me.

Just FYI for anyone reading: I use a tracking device on my rescue inhaler (Propeller). It is free from the site (Google Propeller). A phone app allows you to track triggers, frequency and it even gives reminders for you to take/use medications.

  The graphs it created of my rescue Inhaler use since August 2019 (hardly used) showed how much more often I needed it in March. I shared these with my doctor. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> He's incredible. I wish more people would listen </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> <COVID-19 TRUTH>
*Most people won’t get the virus.*
*Most of the people who get it won’t display symptoms.*
*Most of the people who display symptoms will only be mildly sick.*
*Most of the people with severe symptoms will never be critically ill.*
*And most of the people who get critically ill will survive.*

This is borne out by the numerous serological studies which show, again and again, that the infection fatality ratio is on par with flu.
( https://swprs.org/studies-on-covid-19-lethality/ )
There is no science – and increasingly little rational discussion – to justify the lockdown measures and overall sense of global panic.
Nevertheless, it’s always good to get official acknowledgement of the truth, even if it has to be leaked.
Here are three leaks showing that those in power know that the coronavirus poses no threat, and in no way justifies the lockdown that is going to destroy the livelihoods of so many.
1. “IT’S ALL BULLSHIT!”
On May 26th Dr Alexander Myasnikov, Russia’s head of coronavirus information, gave an interview to former-Presidential candidate Ksenia Sobchak in which he apparently let slip his true feelings.
( https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/05/27/its-all-bullsht-russias-coronavirus-information-chief-says-of-virus-fears-a70398 )
Believing the interview over, and the camera turned off, Myasnikov said:
It’s all bullshit […] It’s all exaggerated. It’s an acute respiratory disease with minimal mortality […] Why has the whole world been destroyed? That I don’t know,”

<COMMENT 6> Someone says to us corona virus is nothing but a kind of a flu. Today I have really, truly understood that is not the case. It,s a very much dangerous  disease against which we have to be alert as much as possible, because it will causes  ARDS to us, and which will be seriously critical for us.  You are great!!! Today, on May 30,  2020, I have watched your video clip. Thank YOU from Japan. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> I’m watching this on 31st May and everything he said 2 months back is exactly what’s happening now! I hope in India things get better really soon.
Thanks for the important info Doc. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> i got the virus and am afraid it's gonna kill me here overseas, 😭 😭 </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Thanks for this vital important information dr. Vuong this is some serious times we are living in we need people like you to tell us the truth about this virus. Please keep bringing us this important information.stay safe and stay blessed.😊🙂🤔 </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> This guy is JOKE </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Now India has 166K COVID19 case. The USA has 1.76M </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Ominous to see this once we actually have reached 1 million cases. Thank you for getting information out there! </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Man! You were so damn wrong. It was not 20K people died bc of this virus like u said. The number just passed 100K. I got a feeling that US government intentionally let the virus spread wildly to weed out the old, the weak and the sick to reduce the cost of health care. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Dr. what is your opinion on the patent list which follows (includes implications)  . .from Alfred Lambremont Webre’s research, a list of patents from the last decade:

US7220852B1 Modified Human Corona virus. Holder: CDC. 2003
(our own govt Center for Disease Control)

US20060257852A1 SARS Holder: Glaxosmithkline 2004
(Pharmaceutical company)

US8343506B2 Chimeric Chikunguya virus Holder University of Texas. 2010

US10130701B2 Corona virus chimeric genetic manipulation Holder Pirbright Inst. 2014

EP3172319B1 VACCINE for Corona virus Holder: Pirbright Inst. 2014. (Pirbright Inst. funded by Bill and Melinda Gates Fdn.)

US579246A Virus Replication system. Chimeric Holder US Army

WO200806347A2 Nanobots RF A! control of humans. Holder: Neil Solomon 2006.

Okay summary ...
On these patents, some are obvious, some you have to read between the lines... but the purpose is to show irrevocably that technology exists and that things have been done that are denied and lied to the public by the Mainstream Media (MSM)

A) So here is proof the virus was a bioengineered weapon 😎
B) That the law was broken to develop "gain of function" by Chimeric research
C) That a vaccine already existed before the COVID19 outbreak. 
D) that Nanobots are in the vaccines.
E) that nanobots are being sprayed thru aerosols (Chemtrails)
F) that these nanobots can be programmed to kill someone very rapidly
G) that these are/can be activated and controlled by (EMF) Electromagnetic energy Radio/microwave transmission - i.e. 5G technology.
H) that A.I. (Artificial Intelligence) control can/will be initiated thru these means.
I) that the coming crypto- currency will depend on you having the bots, and will monitor your every move. etc, etc etc....

<COMMENT 2> Lies. In Hungary we have a list on the government's official page of all the deceased that were infected with the virus. They were either very old (+70) or they had a whole bunch of illnesses. Not a single healthy 50 years old person died due to the infection let alone 20-30 years olds.

<COMMENT 4> This is what make America a country full of racist people. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> What about thousands of American citizen and green card holders medical graduates delivering pizza, working as a waitress driving for UBER, LFYT, who are being denied medical residency training that were replaced by foreign medical graduates . </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> That sucks! </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> The reason they gave her: you provide no unique value to the United States. 

The real reason why the denied her a green card: ‘’ bitch you ugly and you look like a terrorist so nah thanks’’ </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> America sucks. That is.. USA. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> WTF?? </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> The reason she wasn't issued a green card is because the new administration has drastically cut the number of green cards for H1B visas, which seems that she falls in to. Citizens of specific countries, predominantly India were applying and getting a high number of H1B visas and once they arrived, changed that into a green card and stayed. When the new administration took the grabs on power, it didn't only not like immigration, but also saw the number of H1B to green card converts, which in itself seems a betrayal. The entire scenario may have played a role in not issuing green card to this physician since the numbers have been dramatically cut/. This also means, a model from another country may get a green card because there may not be so many who have applied yet. Her lawyer can petition and request the USCIS to give a detailed response as to why she wasn't issued a green card! </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> WHY ON EARTH WOULD YOU FIGHT TO STAY IN THE U.S?? I MEAN, CANADA? EUROPE?  You help their people and they deny you entrance. Screw them. Seriously. Screw them. They don't deserve you. </COMMENT 11>

<COMMENT 16> I am sure that if America doesn’t want her, Australia would welcome her with open arms.  But I am sure America will accept her and once again Trump will have to eat humble pie. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Why should we be praising the president and Karens and Kevins who demand haircuts, guns, Starbucks when we should be praising these poor healthcare workers who are working their asses off and putting themselves in mortal danger to keep us safe?
And this is the thanks they get. "Go to China" "My rights" "My gun rights" "Commie". 
Karens and Kevins, theses are the same people who gave you advice on how to lose your blubber and help you stay fit  in your bathing suit so that you'll show off your body at the beach right now. And telling them to go to China is your way of saying thank you? Oh please...

It's like how Trump insulted POWs. They were in mortal danger and he victim blames them. This is why I'm losing faith in this country. </COMMENT 17>

<COMMENT 1> Can you do an episode about whether this disease is airborne or not? I am confused about why they keep saying this disease is not airborne. Sure, it doesn't seem to be airborne like the worst diseases, but at least in poor ventilated spaces you could argue it is somewhat airborne. Whenever I hear officials talk, they act as if there is nothing between 0% airborne and 100% airborne. It doesn't make any sense. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> one of the four phobias facing modern sciences' dialogue with public are issues of poo trash dying and mind. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> I'm honestly considering a fecal transfer. Because antibiotics, has killed my defense. </COMMENT 3>

<COMMENT 7> Off topic a bit, but, I see ads for new cleaning services that spray businesses, grocery stores  and the like. Your episode on Hand sanitizer talked about how it worked and that it would not contribute to resistant bacteria. But these ads say that the chemical is the same as used in hospitals and we know that that is where some of the resistant bacteria come form. Any ideas on this? </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> That does not sound like a fun job to be the stool sample checker. </COMMENT 8>

<COMMENT 12> My name is Hank Green and... 
What happened to introducing yourself? </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Hey. The institute I did my undergraduate honours research is the Australian sewage study. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Insofar as I am concerned nCov19 sounds much better than SarsCOV2 </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> The reason I've not went outside is actually the brain-poking test being applied and you are telling me now I can simply take a dump? 🤣
Someone please help me write an essay to convince my government to do this! </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Hey guys, I have a science channel discussing new clinical research and would love if you could check it out - let me know what you think!? :) </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> I don't know if it can be done considering how fragile Sars - CoV-2 is (it doesn't infect mice, and it's hard to grow in a lab), but fecal occult blood tests are common at - home tests where swabs and packaging are sent in the mail along with instructions on how to properly take the sample.
If such testing can be successfully done in the home, perhaps a similar one can be done for Sars - CoV-2 as well. Perhaps a tube of medium could be included to inoculate with the swab sample in order to encourage growth of the virus.

Then again, if it requires a cell to hijack, this might be impossible to do. A virus is not a bacterium, after all. And if cells are included in the medium, it makes the package a biohazard, and I think that either the post office won't deliver it or there are special regulations for doing so.

But if you can find Sars - CoV-2 in sewage, there's got to be something in sewage to sustain the virus. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Um, who doesn't swallow their own spit? Less water I have to drink.

Also, I swallow my luggies all the time. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> I honestly thought this was going to talk about why some people need lots of toilet paper. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Real question: embalmers dump blood down drains, would that not skew results? </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 1> Human beings are generally racists. One of my fellow muslim colleague was suspected of covid19. Suddenly, i am also a carrier because im a muslim. It sucks. Really. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Many Chinese living abroad are loyal to the CCP, though most are probably not. China has locked up innocent Canadians, over a million innocent Uhigurs as well as Christians, Tibetan Buddhists and critics of the government. China allows the harvesting of their organs for profit. China undermines democracies around the world, including Canada. 

Why does the Canadian media criticise Trump for defending USA against the CCP propaganda campaign that the Pandemic originated in USA and was brought to China by US military? Only after this did Trump start calling it the "Chinese virus" - push back. Canadian media should do your research before misleading your public.

Why does Canadian media criticise those who are fearful about Chinese communists spying in Canada, infiltrating Canadian Universities and research programs, stealing secrets and undermining your citizens' health and security?  This failure creates frustration with fearful viewers, and fuels the backlash against Asian-Canadians by those who don't know any better. Clearly there is nuance here, and complexity. Only telling half the story and suppressing the other half is a failure in your obligation to properly inform the public.

Also, the sad fact of human nature in times of crisis is to be suspicious of the loyalty of anyone with ties to an adversary who has harmed the nation. If I were in this category I'd look for any opportunity to demonstrate my loyalty so stupid folks would not assume I am a traitor or threat.  Sounds crazy, I know, but this is how some people think, and I'd try to reassure them for my own sake, rather than let a misunderstanding lead to an avoidable incident. Complaining about discrimination is not likely to reassure these fearful people. It might just make them angrier.  

If you are a loyal Canadian who opposes the CCP, but fearful people don't know this because of your appearance, help correct this unfortunate misunderstanding. Reassure them if this is possible. 

If you favor the CCP over Canada and free societies, expect to be openly criticised and treated with hostility. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> The asian community been quiet this whole time </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> She didn't mention that many Asians are very racist against people of African ancestry, and also against Europeans. This is well known, and speaks to the complexity of the issue. Too bad she sidestepped this. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> China is a country.
That's not racist. It is a fact. 
Are we never to criticise China or ever highlight any problems it causes? </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> The ccp is behind this subversion... don't fall for the rhetoric of these marxists... it is well organised and precisely timed with our current financial and social problems
... </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Asian should drive the price up.. then sell them all.. tank the price.. 🤭🤭🤭 </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Pull money, sell assets.. all of them.. stop buying from white shop.. send all of your assets to overseas.. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Is Asia getting too small for the 5.5 billion Asian population? They are migrating in millions to Europe, Africa, New Zealand, Australia ..... </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Chinese abusing Africans and blaming them for the Coronavirus, a pot calling a kettle black 😂😂😂😳😷😷😷 </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> There was nothing about race in Adam's rant. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> white folks she says.... </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> I call bulls**t on this. More race baiting by MSM. Do you really think that Canadians are that stupid that they associate covid (certificate of vaccination ID) with skin color? Granted there may be one or two, you can't fix stupid, but it certainly is not mainstream or it would have made Global News, the champion racebaiter channel in Canada. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Even Before virus emerged, there are always asian racism in europe and north america.But before it was a more passive racism. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> fact is there has been incidents of people being verbally and physically abused because of their race, that seems like a fair reason to be concerned about, but its kinda disturbing how people in the comment section are deflecting and playing mental gymnastic that its not racist? </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Having lived in the US and Canada, I personally find Canadian style racism more difficult to deal with because of its subtlety and passive-aggresiveness. Of course, much lower prevalence rate in Canada. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Asian Lives Matter! </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Two biggest group that immigrates to Canada are China India 
China is dominated by Han heavily biased towards their interest over others
India is dominated by Hindi/Sikh heavily biased towards their interest over others
What im saying is they are in no position to point out discrimination. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> The laboratory in Wuhan was likely the original source of the pandemic and the chieftain of China and The chiefs of WHO should be brought accountable for the horrendous pandemic worldwide. If the chieftain of China hadn't told WHO the pandemic was controllable and asked WHO to postpone declaring the serious outbreak of the covid 19 in China on January 21th and if WHO didn't urge every country shouldn't stopped the flights to and from China at the end of January and meanwhile tens of thousands of passengers had carried the virus to every corner of the world from Wuhan China, more than 5 millions of the virus infected should have been saved and the whole world wouldn't have been trampled down like this. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> everyone thinks all asians are chinese </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 1> Il ne réalise pas que toute cette réponse a été orchestrée par le deep state qui veulent vacciner la planète et nous mettre sous surveillance à des fins de contrôle. Bill Gates a pris le contrôle de l’Organisation Mondiale de la Santé et a su diriger les efforts dans ce sens. Les fausses statistiques, la suppression des protocoles médicaux tels que la chloroquine, les masques, la distance sociale, semer la panique, la crémation immédiate sans autopsie,  étirer la courbe le plus possible sans aucun bénéfice autre que de donner du temps de développer un vaccin qui ne servira à rien, etc etc cette pandémie mie a été créée de toute pièce. Voir Event201  et surtout avait été prédit par le fameux Dr. Fauci qui détient des intérêts financiers dans des produits pharmaceutiques. Conflits d’intérêts sites-On? On se serre maintenant de la Chine comme modèle de réponse, selon l’OMS, mensonges après mensonges. </COMMENT 1>

<COMMENT 7> Chacun peut aller voir les études disponibles sur le site de l'IHU: elles sont nombreuses ne démontrent pas du tout l'efficacité du protocole Raoult, car la plupart traitent d'un autre sujet (Hors-Sujet), ou sont des travaux en éprouvette/in vitro (c'est inutile, on veut des résultats in vivo), et au final, la seule étude qui pourrait prouver l'efficacité de ce protocole porte sur 1,061 malades mais sans aucun groupe contrôle, ce qui rend l'étude totalement inutile puisqu'on ne peut pas comparer ces résultats à un groupe-test. L'IHU met en ligne plein d'études mais c'est de l'enfumage, et rien ne prouve l'efficacité du protocole Raoult.https://www.mediterranee-infection.com/pre-prints-ihu/
E1- étude sur la contagiosité (HS)
E2- étude sur la charge virale de 80 personnes (faible valeur statistique) sans groupe contrôle (on ignore si le traitement est efficace ou pas).
E3- traite de la contamination des enfants (HS)
E4- test in vitro (aucun intérêt, car on veut des résultats in vivo)
E5- compare taux mortalité entre 2019 et 2020 dans le sud-est (étude locale + HS)
E6- la fameuse étude sur 1061 malades, mais sans groupe-test donc ça ne prouve rien (le taux de mortalité est "bas" mais comparé à quoi?)
E7- test in vitro (aucun intérêt, car on veut des résultats in vivo)
E8- étude qui critique une autre étude (n'apporte rien de nouveau)
E9- étude sur la toxicité de HCQ+AZI (HS)
E10- étude qui critique d'autres études qui prouveraient que l'HCQ et AZI ne sont pas efficaces (la plupart des études sont disqualifiées sur la base de biais alors que les études de Raoult ne comportent aucun groupe-test, ce qui est le plus gros de tous les biais! lol)
E11- test sur la détection du virus (HS)
E12- mesure de la contamination chez les SDF (HS)
E13- étude sur la performance des microscopes (HS)
E14- étude sur l'isolationd des virus (HS) </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> La chloroquine est connue depuis 50 ans pour n'avoir aucun effet anti-viral sur les êtres vivants (vous pouvez vérifier, tous les chercheurs du monde le disent), et contre le SARS ou le MERS (qui sont aussi des coronavirus) personne n'a jamais utilisé de chloroquine (logique). Jusqu'au jour où le Pr. Raoult a déclaré que la chloroquine associée à l'azythromicine était soudainement devenue efficace contre le coronavirus. Ah bon? Mais quelle étude prouve cela? Parce que maintenant y'a tellement d'études qui prouvent que quelque soit les combinaisons HCQ/ AZI et quelque soit l'état du patient (critique ou symptomes moyens) le "protocole-Raoult" ne sert à rien, que faudrait d'abord que Raoult nous fournisse une étude scientifique solide qui prouve que son protocole fonctionne avant de nous emmerder avec propos mensongers...

<COMMENT 9> le virus le plus dangereux, c'est les medias, propriétaire d'une poignée de personnes. qui nous ENFONCENT en nous bourrant le cerveau des absurdités, nous rendant consommateurs à perpétuité.....
La presse est un pouvoir sans contre-pouvoir. Pourquoi la presse majoritaire est-elle libérale bien qu’elle touche 900'000.00 millions par an d’aides de L’Etat (chiffre de 2013, détail édifiant dans : « Les aides de l’État à la presse écrite » , La Cour des comptes, 18 septembre 2013)  - aides sans lesquelles elle ne pourrait pas vivre ?
Comme à la caserne. Ceux qui ne marchent au pas ? La raclée… La presse étant une juridiction d’exception, les passages à tabac médiatiques sont classés sans suite.  Raison d’Etat, police des moeurs, secret défense… </COMMENT 9>

<COMMENT 11> ASMR 😴 </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> La leçon à en tirer c'est qu'il faut se méfier des charlatans marseillais en blouse blanche qui prostituent leur savoir et leur serment pour obtenir des "like" sur YouTube et l'approbation des tarés complotistes. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Vive Raoult 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👍👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍 </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Merci pour votre franchise sans arrière-pensée. Heureusement que vous êtes un érudit dans vos Matières, sinon les lobbys vous auraient fait passé de vie à trepas. Merci Professeur de leur tenir tête. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> on n aime votre reaction  qui a ete tres tres rapide jusqu a aujourd hui  ils on rien trouver bla bla bla que du vent vous professeur on vous doit un tres grand respect vous avez mis le medicament miraculeux sur la table vos paroles tres veridique   que 525 morts en algerie et beaucoup moins au maroc car ils on acheter le stoc de l usine a casa c est pas du poison  sympthomes le traitement est la merci et meme respect pour le plus grand guerrisseur de la planete professeur raoult       el </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> que 525 morts en algerie sur 43 millions d habitants et que 188 morts au maroc car ils ont acheter tout le stoc de chloroquine  vive le roi     vive le plus grand guerrisseur de la planete le professeur raoult    un saint homme       le plus grand         el </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Je suis d accord avec vous prof une épidémie ne disparues pas comme cela du jour au lendemain et je crois comme vous que cela va ce calmé   cela va prendre un peut de temps mais malheureusement ils y aura d autre épidémie comme vous dite ont ne comprend pas pourquoi les médecin ne veulent plus soigner  les gens beaucoup de médecin vont perdre leur clientèle  et la confiance en leur médecin en plus ils faut déclaré  à la sécu les patient qui sont malade du covid c est quoi cet enfumage la sécu et au courant de tous elle nous envois nos attestations  avec tout les traitement que nous prenons  en plus ils veule payez les médecin pour qu' il déclare les malade  c est honteux personnellement  si j attrape  le covid je ne vais pas chez le médecin je reste chez moi avec la paracétamol même si je suis une personne fragile ça me fera gagné  une visite au médecin et comme de toute façon il ne nous donne rien pourquoi ce déplacé </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> bravo docteur vous etes notre heros </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Merci encore Professeur. Quand je pense qu'à l'heure actuelle il y a encore des "médecins" qui balancent des études sur le peu d'effets de la chloroquine et sa dangerosité... quand on sait lire on voit vite que c'est utilisé hors protocole en fin de course à des doses très élevées. La malhonnêteté de la pharmaco est sans borne avec des traîtres qui les suivent ! </COMMENT 19>

<DESCRIPTION> Recorded on May 8, 2020 Dr. Jay Bhattacharaya from Stanford Medicine makes his third appearance on Uncommon Knowledge in eight weeks, this time to ... </DESCRIPTION>
<TAGS> ['Uncommon Knowledge', 'Peter Robinson', 'Jay Bhattacharaya', 'MLB', 'Major League Baseball', 'COVID-19', 'Lockdown'] </TAGS>
<COMMENT 1> Even if the lock-down achieved the goal, so what? We started this travesty based upon MILLIONS of potential deaths, and, it turns out, that was NEVER going to happen. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> interesting </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> So since the lockdown will not stop the disease in the long run it is going to run its course anyway once the lockdown is lifted, the lockdown has not saved any lives it is in fact cost more lives. People who did not receive the normal Medical Care they would have gotten because they were locked down, people who committed suicide, people who starved to death in poor countries, and the list goes on and on the people who would not have died if there were no lockdown. The lockdown it's actually killed more people in the long run </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Lockdown is not sustainable for any country , this lockdown is just putting off the inevitable. We are all gonna run of money and credit soon. What are we do we do then? I am very worried about that. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Dr. Jay Bhattacharya: what is your view about hydroxychloroquine together with zinc in the early stages of infection? </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Interesting interview.  Everyone can agree that the number of Covid-19 cases depends on the number of testing, and is not meaningful.  The only statistics that I trust is the all-cause mortality rate.  The other numbers are debatable.  For example, in NYC the all-cause mortality rate is +225% above seasonal average.  It's useful to find out if the excess deaths are mainly caused by Covid-19 or caused by the lockdown.  This can help us determine what we need to do next. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Throughout entire conversation the immune system was never mentioned.  There are many genius scientists advising immune defense.  Vitamin D3 C A and zinc.  There was a survey of a large group who died from Covid 19. They found extremely  vitamin D  deficiencies in those patients. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> DR BUTTAR EXPLAINS ABOUT COVIT19 
PLEASE. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Capitalism and national health care do not mix. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Trying to understand:  People should self-isolate if they feel they are at risk. We do not have to mandatorily shut everything down. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Very good Covid19 info session...  BEST so far </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Heaven help me, DJT? I’m out at 33:06. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> If I wanted to know what the main stream media reports to be the case, I would watch CNN thank you. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> You wasted your work. Covis-19 is not total population based and any study based on general population should be discarded. The study population should be based on senior popution. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Covid-19 is old age related. You are not including age griuos. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Is this antibody test soecific to Covid-19? What did you find about age specific group orevalence? </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> You may as well let it run it’s course and deal with it now </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Warmer weather promotes vitamin D because people get more sunshine in warmer weather.  Those deficient in vitamin D have been shown to suffer far more in other studies. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> The Plague? Come on. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Such an honest men. It’s what we need, interesting and curious. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 10> I am Iranian. I tell you, dear people of the world, that in spite of all these economic problems in Iran, the Iranian people are still kind to each other and help each other.

<COMMENT 15> Chinese communist regime brought Coronavirus to Iran and should pay all Iranians affected by Coronavirus pandemic. Death to the supreme leader of Iran for allowing this to spread. Iran can't buy medicine because the supreme leader is giving billions of dollars to  terrorists groups like Hezbollah, Iran is involved in all wars in the middle east maybe if they stop getting involved in these wars that money for those wars can be used for Iran's citizens... </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> YOU NEED TO TELL THAT the sanctions did not include medical supplies of any kind !  the leader refused to accept any from US because he said the US could use the supplies to spy on Iran !!WTF !! AND the sanctions are because Iran refuse to stop its nuclear weapon development , IT will let people die rather than stop trying to make a Nuclear weapon !! </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Gaddafi died when he brought up the idea of a gold currency to trade oil. This is dangerous </COMMENT 17>

<COMMENT 4> Great video once again, thanks for your work! </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Meat isn't going anywhere when it is revealed the "pandemic" was staged and fake.... </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Hey Ed, i am planing on becoming a vegan. Are there any books you would recommend? I love reading books and would like to educate myself more on this topic. Greetings from Germany! </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Great to see so many people newly vegan! Just watch out for your omega 3s guys, this caught me of guard recently, just google it & get flaxseed oil or better yet algal oil and you'll be golden! 😊 </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> In lockdown while feeling anxious like everyone, I was also feeling optimistic everyone talking about the 'new normal'. However, now that lockdown has been eased, the new normal is only the old normal with face masks. NOTHING has changed where I live. This is the reason why it is now more than ever before so important to become vegan activists. Now we have another reason - the next pandemic, like the world needed another reason to go vegan. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> I hope you’re right! But I’m scared it’s going to be back to normal after this and everybody is going to be eating meat again... </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Man, u look sick. Just look in the mirror. </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Only heartless people or sheer brainless ppl eat meat </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> You are very inspirational and i support you...i hope every non-vegan understands the suffering of animals and think rationally ..✌ </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> Thank you for everything you do Ed🙏🏼 you inspire me everyday. Veganism is the future!💫😌 </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> Can we already blow up these slaughterhouses? </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> I went vegan as a direct result of this pandemic. </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Went vegan overnight in April and it was the best thing I’ve ever done for my health and my conscience. I’ve lost 3kg and my depression has disappeared. I was borderline suicidal. Going vegan saved my life. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> meat is yummy </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> People will agree but won't change... It makes me so sad </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> I was talking to someone about this the other day and they said that they'd rather die than stop eating animal products and that as animal agriculture is likely to lead to more pandemics, they're going to eat as much meat as they can now while they still can. People are actually nuts. To me that sounds like exactly the kind of thing an alcoholic would say about booze. </COMMENT 19>

<COMMENT 1> Very good and insightful interview </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> But.   People also need to understand that all this is just based on the assumption that there is 1/  a virus in the first place  2/  A virus is causing sickness.  There is no peer reviewed science behind either of those two assumptions.   Yes.  That's right.  there is no peer reviewed proof of a virus or of a viral  infection as of 8th June 2020......... Let that sink in. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Could it be something like what happened with smallpox?  What I mean, is that people who had cowpox had some immunity to smallpox, I believe.  Could it be that if a person has had some other disease could be immune or less likely to become deathly ill?  I have no idea what I am saying here.  It was just something that I thought of as I was listening to this. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> what about beer drinking? Austria, Czech Republic and Germany are the people that drink more beer in Europe and they have very low levels of deaths and infections. There may be sth in the beer hops that protects. I myseld started drinking more beer to protect me from covid. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Why not ask Black Lived Matter they have all the answers </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> Would like to get this man together with Dr John Campbell. </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> The lockdowns make sense when you realize this plandemic is not about our welfare but instead about laying the foundation for the establishment of a police-surveillance state. We get to trade our social distancing and masks for that fucking maniac Gates' poison vaccine. Wake up, people. </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Only watched 10 minutes and quit this as MEANINGLESS. I am not saying after it's all over statisticians CAN’T expose important, regional/socio-economic/cultural-behavioral factors which influenced the spread. As for the IMPACT, do current models incorporate exposure to similar viruses, corona or otherwise utilizing the ACE-2 receptor, and how THAT affects immune response? 
Then there's the new traditions/cultural expectations for EVERYONE _(which in modern Asia is now more protocols/policies/procedures than superstitions)_ where EVERYONE WORKS TO ENACT AND DEVELOP, ALWAYS ADAPTING, shooting for BETTER, LIVING WITH AN OUTBREAK OF DISEASE, *not an insane fantasy of WINNING* )_  in Asia for the past decade working to blockade SARS and the Avian Flu, when the rest of world... ummm, maybe noticed, but never had to lift a finger to stop it.

_THANKS ASIA!_ For stomping out the sickness and disease the UNTHINKING IDIOTS in the Western Hemisphere never had to PRETEND GOD, *_laying on of hands_*_ or ROBUST/DELUSIONAL VITALITY could overcome_ I for one USA citizen appreciate... you helped yourselves and benefiting EVERYONE else in the enormous effort. My people love simple stories, so few of us will ever understand all your hard work. I'm sorry: They must think for themselves to build a sustainable society in a finite world, and most won't ever *_(the coming apocalypse FAIRY TAIL is all about people who have some inkling THEY DON’T UNDERSTAND THE WORLD THEY RUIN, so want a do over or something, anything, but to be face the reality they were too LAZY MINDED to understand, while committed to PRETENDING THEY WHERE INSIGHTFUL ADULTS, when they only ever developed minds like small children.)_*

Yet they need to live out their lives... --You have your feeble minded too.-- We have our feeble minded, in the West and East and everywhere in-between: Language is a problem... they EXIST, *have* implies ownership/responsibility/control over, when people NEED TO THINK FOR THEMSELVES, and so many puffed up with inflated egos or playing a game at BEING DIVINE CREATURES... are functionally illiterate by 5th grade standards, imitative accommodators, just longing to not stand out, striving to PLAY A PART in a community of people who PRETEND the regurgitive nonsense they VOMIT on QUE _(as they were trained to do by Fox News)_ was their OWN INDEPENDENT THOUGHT. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> Government interventions are useless at best, and often horribly destructive. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> The "Dark Matter" in Germany: it is the social behaviour here. We practised Social Distancing long before Corona. It is the ugly side of our bahaviour. The typical mediterranean style of behaviour, the more "physical" interaction: the embracing, the peck left and right of the french, the loud speaking and hand gesticulation of italians and spanish people - what has made us so boring has saved us from the virus.
By the way: there are huge differences in Germany - in the regions of former East Germany (Thuringia, Mecklenburg) You have practically NO infection. In Bavaria You have rates like in London - so the geographical location of the virus also plays a role.
Two factors You have overseen:
1. the Air Pollution, which is heavy in Northern Italy, Madrid, Northern France, New York, New Jersey and all the other hot spots;
2. the social dimension: poor people in UK, USA, Italy .. they are REALLY poor and can not afford good vegetables. They do eat cheap carbohydrates (pasta, pizzas, bread) and mass-produced cheap meat (burgers, fish&chips). Sometimes it pays to hae a welfare-state ;-)
So the "Dark Matter" clears up: it is behavioural, ecological and social matter ! </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> I am happy to read many critical comments regarding the political measures. I am German and I am very concerned about what is happening to our society. Angela Merkel said: "This pandemic is only over when there is a vaccine" - and I thought the pandemic is over when there are no more infected people....... </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Great information here, I think it has it has a lot in common with Peerless Reads Andrew Mather;https://youtu.be/4TOLhs7ZExw </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> This is called hindsight analysis, which is not relevant. Given the level of information that we had AT THE TIME, what should we have done? This is just like the Y2K problem in which very little happened at the appointed time, but whether that was due to preventive measures or whether the fears were unfounded is still, to the best of my knowledge, undetermined. If I were a callous person, I would have let the so called herd take care of this pandemic, but we would then have to listen to the wailing and gnashing of teeth from the survivors of that holocaust forever afterwards. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> F**k your Solidarity bullsh*t...High hopes of vaccinating the world!!...hahaha  just all Floggs Can Someone tell these puppet leaders that the flu is just about done,  these smashers just love to waste taxpayers money on something that no one will consent to anyhow (CCP Poison)...They can  jab the crap in their own arm then their Children and families!! </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> What you need is  an  'Evolutionary Biologist" ! One that comprehends the Biological Imperative... </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> Great interview, from a common sense view, this is exactly what Government should be taking heed of. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> just look at the BLM protests - social distancing IS dead.  No police response to breach of "rules" means they cannot now respond to any subsequent breaches.  They wouldn't survive examination in court and someone with the resources will try to ensure that examination takes place.  All by 7th June - better prediction than many others? </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Prof. Friston, unlike so many media darlings, is a real scientist, a mathematician who is very cautious about the predictive use of his mathematical models.  That humility is refreshing.  Modeling is based on a wide range of variables and assumptions, which makes them subject to error.  One way of testing models is to look at actual clinical data, which is always preferable to a mere model.  The statistical data from each country (except those nations whose statistics are State controlled and manipulated) are similar, which suggests the shut down strategy made very little difference and that the virus spread through each population long before the lockdown order was given.  That was the conclusion I posted here in early March, 2020.   

Whether that is true or not, there is in each country a very large percentage of the population that has remained unaffected.  Even in the US, which has had numerous "hot spots," probably due to environmental or genetic factors, the total cases at this time (June 7) is under 2 million out of a total population of 330 million, or  only 6\10 of 1%.  The rest didn't get sick or weren't sick enough to get tested.  That indicates Prof. Friston's model is correct; a very large percentage of the US population is either "not susceptible" to C-19 or not exposed to conditions favorable to infection.  Whatever the ultimate answer, it indicates there is little reason to extend the shut down.  The recent mass demonstrations in the US, where supposedly susceptible black men spoke and shouted in close proximity, wildly sharing germs, ought to quickly demonstrate whether social distancing matters at all.

This line of reasoning calls into question the wisdom of ordering the shut down in the first place (an unproved strategy recommended in flawed studies of liberal academicians) and whether a C-19 vaccine is even needed.  It is quite possible politicians panicked and imposed a shut down, wrecking the economy, destroying small businesses, and causing wide-spread unemployment for nothing.  But I doubt we will hear any of them accepting responsibility for what appears to be the greatest political blunder in my lifetime. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> This is of course all guesswork. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> Esoteric study with no hard data. These models are only as good as the inputs. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 1> My thoughts is exactly as Toney Gordon about why push vaccines.   JAMAICANS REJECT THEIR VACCINES ON COVID 19.  You did not fair as bad as the other rich countries.   Why re they trying to vaccinate you.  Let them use it on themselves.  Mr prime minister do not let them draw you out with their money.  Their vaccine is being rushed and they want to test it on the poor.  I implore you do not listen fellow Jamaicans </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Blah Blah blah </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> Wat the sense in having 50 people in the church for funeral and having 15 people for the beriual </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> God bless Jamaica 🇯🇲 </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Talk about colourism and classism. Tertiary  education must be seen and treated as a right and not a privilege. Chinese and the Jamaican whites are the only ones prospering. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> On the matter of opening the country  for tourism, bad idea not to have them tested. Test them all, better yet quarantine them 14 days that everyone got.  Confine them to their trip location. Watch those Jamaicans who love to give blye and are lickey lickey! They may create a snag in the health structure at this time.Yes please reiterate that they must respect us </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> Mr. Prime Minster can you ask the Minister of Agriculture to get some yams-white/yellow/, pum pum yams, green banana, ackee and mangoes into Brooklyn New York. We have a stay at home black people day coming up in July. None of our people have the franchise to sell these items. Please help us send them to the High End stores, Target, Trader Joes, and Whole foods starting this coming weekend. You said that farmers lacked markets we have the need please help us.Shalom </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> I think THE PRIME MINISTER has good intentions but he is in "A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE". </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> This covid isnt as bad as they making it to b listen to the specialist doc across us,u r slowly brining in communism and the one world order slowly but surely, </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Y is our priminister leading us like a sheep to the slaughter,u r pushing bill gates adgender to vaccinate jamaican people,u onlycan trick some but not all,open your eyes jamaican </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> Love them or hate them: this government is trying. They are doing a much better job than many developed nation in response to this crisis. The country has to reopen for people to earn a living and feed their families. As a matter of fact the virus will not go away and we cannot stay in lockdown for ever; we just need to try and keep ourself and others safe! </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Strong presentation Ed Bartlett. Mi feel safe. Hope for our success  <3 </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> ..40 years without trial that's wickedness ..I bet nothing come out of this case smh the justice system sucks </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> PM this is a part of you JD, you are doing a good job as best as possible. But testing has to imeraptive as to protect Jamaicans. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> So what you saying about the policemen that are killing our youths </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> So what  about  placement  of SCHOOL </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> What about the dance world? </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Open the country now </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> So Andrew put on his own now!! </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> They 're  tellimg us to wesr masks and i don't see not one of them coming up in a mask and then removing it which should not be either as they say this virus cimes from droplet and i know that spats are flying from their mouths and on those mikes. </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 1> How come everyone regards  Singapore is virus free but really  reported 38,200 cases today?

For safety reason, Singapore should be banned from travelling until it drops to near zero. </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> Fake News as usual......Real news follows:   Germany’s federal government and mainstream media are engaged in damage control after a report that challenges the established Corona narrative leaked from the interior ministry.

Some of the report key passages are:  The dangerousness of Covid-19 was overestimated: probably at no point did the danger posed by the new virus go beyond the normal level.
The people who die from Corona are essentially those who would statistically die this year, because they have reached the end of their lives and their weakened bodies can no longer cope with any random everyday stress (including the approximately 150 viruses currently in circulation).
Worldwide, within a quarter of a year, there has been no more than 250,000 deaths from Covid-19, compared to 1.5 million deaths [25,100 in Germany] during the influenza wave 2017/18.
The danger is obviously no greater than that of many other viruses. There is no evidence that this was more than a false alarm.
A reproach could go along these lines: During the Corona crisis the State has proved itself as one of the biggest producers of Fake News.
So far, so bad. But it gets worse.

The report focuses on the “manifold and heavy consequences of the Corona measures” and warns that these are “grave”.

More people are dying because of state-imposed Corona-measures than they are being killed by the virus.

The reason is a scandal in the making:

A Corona-focused German healthcare system is postponing life-saving surgery and delaying or reducing treatment for non-Corona patients.

Berlin in Denial Mode. The scientists fight back.

Initially, the government tried to dismiss the report as “the work of one employee”, and its contents as “his own opinion” – while the journalists closed ranks, no questions asked, with the politicians.

But the 93-pages report titled “Analysis of the Crisis Management” has been drafted by a scientific panel appointed by the interior ministry and composed by external medical experts from several German universities.

The report was the initiative of a department of the interior ministry called Unit KM4 and in charge with the “Protection of critical infrastructures”.

This is also where the German official turned whistleblower, Stephen Kohn, work(ed), and from where he leaked it to the media. </COMMENT 2>

<COMMENT 1> Ok I hope so because it seems like fssa is making it harder to maintain </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> I had my phone interview and the caseworker insisted I have income coming from something. She asked how I live without income to get necessities. She was so angry with me she never said goodbye, just hung up on me. Why are people treating people who need snap like a lower class individuals. Benefits are for people with low income or no income. 
I'm sure being a caseworker is stressful but don't take it out on the people who need help, that's what causes some people to go hungry instead of being judged. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> FSSA needs to allow e-mail communication in the future, but especially now. The FSSA offices are closed, as are the libraries. I was told that I can mail documents in, but so many are also without a printer while the library is closed. Faxes are nearly a thing of the past and FSSA would be wise to update to a faster, easier, and more organized way of submitting documents. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Super grateful for the food stamps. Truly, I am. The only note I can offer FSSA is that, during a redetermination, if you don't get the documents you need, you don't find out until it's too late to do anything and you have to wait to reapply all over again. There is finally a web page that does offer some communication but it's far from clear. Being able to email documents would be very much appreciated as well. </COMMENT 4>

<COMMENT 1> Follow this man's cleaning tips, but don't follow his dietary advice. Pizza and cereal aren't going to help your immunity fight covid </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> CDC: "About 1 in 3 adults used chemicals or disinfectants unsafely while trying to protect against COVID-19"  You are responsible for many of those. Thanks for deleting my other comments. You've really revealed yourself. </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> I watched both videos and I found them to be extremely helpful! It was also nice that it was presented in a calm positive manner. Well done and highly recommended.😄 Dr. K </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> thank YOU for your wonderful videos! I am sharing on a Jazz List -- oh yeah! the South Florida Jazz List! </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> Hi Dr. Please do an updated video regarding masks, etc and things we should do as things reopen. Thanks for your helpful calming videos. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> I'd like to thank you for revising your video presentation based on additional knowledge. I had seen the original one and heard you had revised your information but had trouble getting YouTube to allow you to revise/edit the video so you did a new one. Thank you for your efforts to share your knowledge with us. 🥰 </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> After several trips and cleaning of groceries, I can see how someone can develop dermatitis </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> Asking the good doctor or a learned person re: the subject matter that has data to back up their reasoning, in this video you didn't address Covid viability in a cold environment. In point of fact, you stated that microbiologists store other virus samples in the cold. I wipe everything down because there is a possibility I will forget. However, as you point out we aren't perfect so I may forget to wipe stuff down. But I'm not going to mind game myself endlessly because that's what the paid for news is for. I will assume that the pathogen remains non food borne. However, I read about bugs in strawberries yesterday.  Thanks for your initial video. I put it to good use in my home and am referring people to this post. Peace, out </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> I disagree about using a service to deliver groceries. I have seen many grocery Pickers and Packers. They are on their  germy cell phones constantly, your items get touched by them, then the cashier then the transport person. Many transport persons then are in contact with many other people- none of whom have any training pertaining to cross-contamination Airborne pathogens or body fluid pathogens. They don't clean their cars in between deliveries and many of them bring family members or helpers.  Ive sern them place bags on the ground also.  The stores are horrible because they were full of these shoppers who are not careful at all. I've Just Seen way too much to ever use that. people will get mad but I'm telling the truth.  it also makes no sense to shorten the hours at the store because now you're forcing everyone to shop together. This is a really nice video for people who have their own homes with private entrances garages or cars. I like the reference to Sparkles because they get on everything in her very hard to get rid of </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> Thanks Doc! </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> You are a very kind man, and I'm happy to see you spreading that kindness around. Thank you so much. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> Great work Doc.  Pls share about take way u brought to office n bring back home. Tq. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> I have a 90 yr old MOm.  I shop once every 4 weeks.  Bring all perishables into the basement . Wash containers in a dishpan of soapy water.  Then disinfect w/ alcohol..  I then remove my mask, hat , shoes and change out of  clothes and leave all grocery bags in the  basement.  I wash my face , ears and neck (exposed skin).  I do worry about my long hair which I put up into my baseball hat .... can the virus attach to the underside of my hair?   The Bottled and boxed grocery  items I leave in my truck for UV rays to destroy.  They will stay out there until we need them... or  for the four week duration .   Lettuce and Berries are particularly of concern to me.   For carryout... I have 2 big sheet pans ready.  We dump all the food into the sheet pans at the door and one person immediately takes the carryout containers / pizza box to the outside trash can.    I remove all envelopes from mail OUTSIDE at the garbage can.  I always disinfect my hands after touching the outside garbage / recycle bins.   We leave our newspaper outside on the porch in the plastic sleeve for a few days, flipping it so the Sun's UV rays can destroy any virus.   After bringing my dogs from the vet I gave them a bath. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> First - do most of this in the garage or outside the house, what comes inside the house should be clean.  Second -  get a trash can for the dirty bags and cardboard boxes, no need to touch them twice. </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Dr. VanWingen, can you please advise on how long the virus may persist in water mixed with laundry detergent?   I have a small portable washing machine and I cannot use hot water - I use a combo of laundry detergent, dishwashing detergent, and Pine-Sol inin the washing machine.  I have no clue as to how much of these to use per gallon of water.  But most useful would be to know how long the virus survives in water mixed with detergent - hard numbers: X many days when the initial water temperature was Y and concentration of (A,B,C,D) detergents was (a,b,c,d) per gallon.  Your answer would save us so many moments of anxiety! Thank you! </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> I definitely would not leave food opened on your counter while you are unwrapping everything else. This virus is .0001 microns big and it can move with the wind.  I would have tops for your containers ready for when you put your food, chicken, chips etc in these containers. </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> Can you explain more how you handle ice cream or other frozen items you have to put into the freezer. Do you wipe them first. They dont dry are they going to be ok. I notice that your clothes are touching everything. What do you do about them? Do you think it wise to leave your shoes out. How long does the virus stay on clothes. </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Great video I have been doing this for weeks forwarding it to friends and family keep safe everyone </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Thand you Doctor.
You are doing your best for millions of viewers worldwide.

<COMMENT 1> Perfect explanation , thank you Dr Kim and good lack in your research!!!!!! </COMMENT 1>
<COMMENT 2> This was excellent. Down to earth, plain language, science based. I worked in US Public Health for over 25 years. Have not heard anyone explain it better. Thank you for posting this interview👍👍 </COMMENT 2>
<COMMENT 3> I understand that you have to edit for time, but where can I find the entire interview?  Thanks. </COMMENT 3>
<COMMENT 4> Asian boss always kept us informed not only about the global pandemic but about what is happening around Asian countries.. </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> When you watch Hatarakou Saibo, this is easy pissy topic to understand. </COMMENT 5>
<COMMENT 6> This is the best explanation ever </COMMENT 6>
<COMMENT 7> I am not asian </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> This is one of the best interviews I've heard. Crystal clear. Thank you for doing this. </COMMENT 8>
<COMMENT 9> I cannot thank you enough for your commitment in informing the public and for the quality of the guests you're choosing all along this crisis. Be again thanked for your efforts and skill 🌼 ! </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> 34:20 </COMMENT 10>
<COMMENT 11> The part about HIV is astounding, wow. Excellent vid. Thank you. </COMMENT 11>
<COMMENT 12> So we got the virus from invading and destroying jungles and stealing wild animals and selling them in wet markets (hell holes). Now, we're going to torture more animals to find a vaccine. It's just messed up that's all. </COMMENT 12>
<COMMENT 13> "Why don't we have a vaccine for HIV?" MONEY. Drug companies make more money selling all the bandaid drugs. </COMMENT 13>
<COMMENT 14> I love these kind of interviews from Asian Boss with real professionals that don't focus on entertaining but on giving accurate information and ending misinformation </COMMENT 14>
<COMMENT 15> Thank you, Dr. Kim </COMMENT 15>
<COMMENT 16> There should be done way these two extremely intelligent physicians can be on main stream tv ! </COMMENT 16>
<COMMENT 17> 99% of the people who got covid recovered without the need for any vaccine. 
Do you know what is in those vaccines? Please check. Baby fetuses, aluminum and formalehyde.
Do you think this will help you with your health? </COMMENT 17>
<COMMENT 18> Please check how the World Health Organisation has made a vaccination campaign in Kenya with an anti-fertility agent in vaccines to sterilise women in 2014.
Please the article on researchgate made by scientist so you can judge by yourself as some articles from some media have tried to say it was a mistake or not true.
They have tried to do the same thing in Mexico, Philippines and Nicaragua in 1994.
I m sure this doctor must know these cases. </COMMENT 18>
<COMMENT 19> Can't believe how he explained so well what is a vaccine and how it works. I understand perfectly. </COMMENT 19>
<COMMENT 20> The way he tells the information and pronounces it , it's very very clear. Wow </COMMENT 20>

<COMMENT 2> As soon as these slack jawed hillbillies open their mouth you know they are willfully ignorant . </COMMENT 2>

<COMMENT 4> Gonna interview these people?

https://youtu.be/SJGT06zIUiY </COMMENT 4>
<COMMENT 5> The solution is really quite simple. Treat all offenders like a Citation, no Ticket is given but if they are not Social Distancing or Wearing a Mask if they later contract COViD-19 and seek medical or financial help they will be denied immediately.

All that the Police need to do is start taking names and adding them to a COViD Offences National Database, part of a ‘Pre-Tracing’ solution.

Name, Address, Gov SIN number...easy...

That way all Hospitals, First Responders, Medical Facilities and Financial Facilities have access to those who have committed the Offence.

That’s how you regulate people in to doing ‘what’s right’ </COMMENT 5>

<COMMENT 5> En bref, des abrutis plus ou moins alcoolisés ou consommateurs de drogue vont profiter du déconfinement pour faire leur révolution de cas sociaux. Au moment même ou les entreprises souvent au bord de la faillite auront besoin de retrouver en urgence de l'activité, des hordes de bolcheviques et d'anarchistes vont bloquer, casser, brûler, bloquer le pays. Les racailles de banlieues s'en donneront à cœur joie et le jour d'après ? Aucun projet, aucune unité, des recettes fiscales en chute libre, la spirale du chaos.

<COMMENT 9> A propos de la mortalité, un petit calcul : 7 milliards d'habitants / hypothèse longévité moyenne 70 ans ( pour ne pas se casser la tête ) = 100 millions de décès par an. </COMMENT 9>
<COMMENT 10> L'article 35 de la Déclaration des droits de l'homme et du citoyen du 24 juin 1793 affirme:
« Quand le gouvernement viole les droits du peuple, l'insurrection est pour le peuple et pour chaque portion du peuple, le plus sacré des droits et le plus indispensable des devoirs ».
Relevant de l'ordre constitutionnel, l'insurrection est ainsi un droit imprescriptible « supérieur aux lois » ; elle permet au peuple de manifester directement sa force et sa puissance plus que son désir de s'opposer aux dérives de l'Etat vers l'arbitraire ou l'injustice manifeste ; elle lui permet d'exprimer pacifiquement (ou violemment, selon l'intensité de la répression qui pourrait lui être opposée par les organes de pouvoir) son refus, son rejet, son objection à toute orientation vers le despotisme et l'autoritarisme. Le droit à l'insurrection signifie clairement que les fondements de la légitimité des pouvoirs publics se sont totalement désorganisés. Il est le « dernier recours » avant la révolution, laquelle peut devenir nécessité si la confusion devient dérèglement et s'inscrit dans l'ordre constitutionnel.
Le droit à l'insurrection a pour titulaire le « peuple », non l'individu ou un groupe d'individus. Il est une « sanction » à l'égard des gouvernements qui ont failli à leurs missions, à leurs taches. </COMMENT 10>

Victoire en vue sur le Covid.
Merci à Corinne Prose pour le partage:

Info transmise par le Whatsapp des professeurs de médecine, médecins et directeurs de clinique du groupe Elsan.
Covid-19 : Une découverte majeure :
Plusieurs équipes dans plusieurs pays (notamment en Chine, en France - à Lille - aux USA), ont fait une découverte majeure qui offre un grand espoir de traitement du covid :
Le virus, en effet, ne tuerait pas directement, mais par l'intermédiaire d'une bactérie intestinale qu'il infecterait, la Prevotella... et c'est cette bactérie infectée qui, devenant virulente, déclencherait l'hyper-réaction immunitaire qui délabre les poumons et tue le malade !
Ceci expliquerait :

Pourquoi le traitement du Dr. Raoult, utilisant un antibiotique (l'Azithromycine), et plus encore celui du Dr Sabine Paliard-Franco, qui préconise une double antibiothérapie, fonctionnent,

Pourquoi les enfants sont épargnés et les personnes âgées plus touchées : Provetella est quasiment absente de la flore intestinale enfantine, mais de plus en plus présente avec l'âge,

Pourquoi les obèses sont beaucoup plus touchés : leur flore intestinale déséquilibrée contient beaucoup de Prevotella !

Pourquoi les complications pulmonaires se déclenchent alors qu'on ne retrouve pratiquement plus de covid dans l'appareil respiratoire, la bactérie infectée (qu'on retrouve dans les selles, contenant de l'ARN du covid et parfois même des virus vivants) prenant le relai de son attaque initiale (bénigne), de manière beaucoup plus dramatique, en déclenchant l'hyper-réaction immunitaire inflammatoire qui noie les poumons...

Pourquoi le virus peut réapparaître chez un patient guéri (avec alternance de positivité et de négativité des tests), car la bactérie, toujours présente dans la flore intestinale, en reste l'hôte et peut le relarguer à tous moments...

Bref, cela expliquerait tout ; et cette cohérence augure de la validité de l'hypothèse.
On tient donc une confirmation de l'intérêt de l'azithromycine, comme thérapeutique curative, à prescrire dès le début de l'infection... et même une piste prometteuse pour traiter préventivement les infections graves (des coronavirus... et sans doute aussi de la grippe !), ce traitement passant par le rétablissement d'une flore intestinale saine qui neutralise Prevotella (par la prescriptions de "probiotiques", c'est à dire d'une bonne flore intestinale)...

Il est clair que cette piste thérapeutique ultra-prometteuse bon-marché rendrait alors caduque l'utilisation d'un vaccin, de découverte aléatoire et onéreuse... ce qui ruinerait donc encore les espoirs lucratifs de Gilead et de ses lobbyistes, après l'échec patent de leurs antiviraux... dont on ne parle plus trop, vu que les premiers essais thérapeutiques (dont plusieurs malades ont payé le prix de leur vie) se sont révélés catastrophiques, tant en terme d'inefficacité que de toxicité...
Il est probable aussi que les médias aux ordres, qui avaient lynché Raoult, parce qu'il laissait entrevoir cette piste thérapeutique bon marché, qui concurrençait leurs antiviraux dont ils attendaient de gros retours financiers, nous taisent cette découverte majeure, et qu'en revanche ils nous serinent maintenant, à temps et à contretemps, que leur vaccin (qui est loin d'être au point et qu'il faudra refaire chaque année, comme celui de la grippe) est la "seule solution" !

<COMMENT 15> Excellente analyse de Michel Maffesoli. C'est vraiment agréable d'entendre des paroles censées sur la situation actuelle et nous expliquer comment les mots faux ont et drainent encore des maux terribles!!  Sa vision d'une nouvelle génération à venir basée sur l'essentiel donne une véritable bouffée d'oxygène,  d'espoir et c'est indispensable pour construire une nouvelle base pour notre avenir. Merci encore pour cette très belle intervention et je souligne votre sens de partage de votre culture avec beaucoup humilité. Je vais me plonger dans vos livres avec impatience !! Tout mon respect. Cordialement. </COMMENT 15>

<COMMENT 8> Chỉ có một cách phòng chống dịch bệnh vô cùng hiệu quả    đó là  tạm dừng đóng cửa khẩu và các hàng hóa ở các nước ngoài về việt nam ...và tạm dừng xuất nhập cảnh về việt nam và việt nam đi các nước  kể cả các nước chưa có dịch  tạm dừng tất cả các chuyên bay từ các nước đến và đi các nước  tạm dừng các khu du lịch ở trong nước... Cấm các lễ hội trên toàn quốc ở thời điểm đang có dịch bùng phát    và các nơi tụ tập đông người    nên tập trung cao độ để phòng chống dịch bệnh.   Có như vậy chắc chắn 100%  Việt nam sẽ  không để dịch bệnh tràn về việt nam </COMMENT 8>

<COMMENT 16> Nước rửa tay thì chỗ mình không thiếu, chỉ có khẩu trang là rất khan hiếm. Mình làm công nhân ở cty, cty của mình không trang bị khẩu trang cho công nhân, là do bản thân mỗi người tự ý thức thôi. Có nhiều chị em không thể mua được khẩu trang y tế thì đeo khẩu trang vải hoặc những loại có tinh thể muối với giá 15k/cái (tái sử dụng được 3 đến 5 lần). Có rất nhiều chị em không chịu nổi và bị dị ứng với khẩu trang vải thì sẽ chọn mua trên mạng với giá chỉ khoảng 60 đến 65k 1 hộp 50 cái. Thực sự các y bác sĩ và những người ở vùng tâm dịch sẽ cần những chiếc khẩu trang kia hơn nhưng với người dân thì.... Thử hỏi làm sao khẩu trang không sốt giá được??? </COMMENT 16>

CÔ-RÔ-NA-VŨ-HÁN

Cô-Rô-Vũ-Hán xổng chuồng
Gây nên dịch bệnh luông tuồng hiểm nguy
Trung-Nam-Hải ém nhẹm đi
Người dân Tàu Cộng chết vì… lây lan
Quạ đen muỗi độc kêu khan
Bầu trời u ám… Hán gian tung hoành
Cô-Vít 19 xuân xanh
Vượt ranh Vũ Hán lộng hành khắp nơi
Gây nên đại dịch cho người
Cách ly, phong tỏa… đáng đời Hán gian
Trung Hoa lục địa bế quan
Chia năm sẻ bảy… suy tàn đến nơi

HẾT BẢY CÒN BA

Ngồi buồn xem chuyện Cô Vi
Mới hơn trăm bữa Cô đi toàn cầu 
Nghe tên trên nét cũng rầu
Bởi đang nổi tiếng năm Châu vang rền
Từ “Hãn Vú” Cô bò lên
Trẻ già bé nhớn Cô “khền” chẳng tha 
Từ người Cô hoá thành ma
Đưa vô lò sấy í a vi trần 
Tàng hình cố giấu đôi chân
Cô bay lơ lửng ghé gần sân bay
Chỉ cần tay chạm… tóc mai
Hương gây mùi nhớ, men cay hít vào
Cô Vi hớn hở đến chào
Bao nhiêu nan phổi ôi chao chứa đầy
Cô cười má đỏ hây hây 
Tha hồ bày tiệc phen nầy no nê
Cách ly, ngăn chặn trò hề 
Thênh thang cất bước theo mê lộ dài
Mask che, đeo kiếng... mặc ai 
Cô Vi đỏng đảnh trổ tài đó nha 
Mười phần hết bảy còn ba

HẬN TÀU CỘNG  

Tim lòng quặn thắt từng cơn
Lòng dâng lên nỗi căm hờn Tàu Hoa
Bao người rưng lệ xót xa
Vì đâu thế giới chan hòa sầu thương
Năm châu,bốn bể đoạn trường
Bầm gan tím ruột giận phường lưu manh
Để cho Cô-Vít hoành hành
Tràn lan khắp chốn và tanh xác người
Cận Bình họ Tập kia ơi,
Sao mà ác quá ông trời chẳng dung
Biển Đông sóng dậy đùng đùng
Đông Nam Châu Á cùng chung số phần
Thiên Công chỉ điểm mấy lần
Bao nhiêu bịnh lạ dần dần xảy ra
Ngày sau tụi nó thành ma
Luật trời vay trả âu là chí công!

<COMMENT 2> Khi bệnh đã lan ra cộng đồng thì phải nghĩ tới sống chung với dịch cũng giống như sống chung với lũ của TT Võ văn Kiệt. Điều mà chúng ta kỳ vọng là sau khi đại dịch phát tán 1 thời gian thì mức độ nặng (ác tính) của bệnh ngày càng giảm theo thời gian. Điều này mang tính quy luật. Tuy nhiên, đợt dịch sau có thể nặng hơn đợt dịch đầu tiên do biến chủng xảy ra (rất hiế gặp). </COMMENT 2>

<COMMENT 4> The video quality is good and the steps shown can be well understood..except that the last step of closing the water tap could hv been done using elbow instead of a tissue (since it isn't available at all places) .Also the tap head can be washed by pouring soap foam & water before finally closing it.
Thanks. </COMMENT 4>

<COMMENT 7> To God be the glory </COMMENT 7>
<COMMENT 8> If anyone seeing this hasn't accepted Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior, Please Come home before it's too late lovelies! 🙏💞 John 3:16 For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life. God is loving and literally true Love; God loves us and wants us not to perish but have everlasting (eternal) life! You don't have to go to Hell it was mean't only for the devil and his angels, but when you don't choose God you automatically (even if you don't realize or mean it) choose the opposite, which is the devil, that's just how it is, and the devil and his minions fates are sealed which is why he wants to bring as many people down with him before he enters his eternal punishment/torture in the lake of fire and brimstone (with his minions/followers). BUT THERE'S HOPE FOR US(the way to God)! And that way and hope is Jesus! | John 14:6 Jesus said to him, “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me. | Heaven is open for all through, and ONLY through Jesus Christ! Jesus is the doorway to the Father (who house is Heaven !) God gave us instructions in how to accept him which is accepting Jesus, so again you do not want to miss out on this FREE GIFT FROM GOD then ACCEPT JESUS IN YOUR HEART TODAY! We are not promised tomorrow! 🙏💕                                                           9 that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved Romans 10:9 🙏 

Q: What must I do to be saved?

A: If you’re asking this question, you’re not far from salvation. Getting saved is a blessed gift from God!

First of all, it is important to realize that  there is only one way to God, and that is through Jesus Christ, the Lord and Savior of the world (John 14:6). The Word of God says if you believe with your heart that God raised Jesus from the dead, and confess Jesus as your Lord, you will be saved (Romans 10:9-10).

Romans 3:23-24 

23 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, 24 and all are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus. 
There is a Heaven to gain, and a Hell to shun!

Salvation is a free gift that God offers us because of His unconditional love through the sacrifice Jesus made in our behalf: “But God showed his great love for us by sending Christ to die for us while we were still sinners” (Romans 5:8).

That should remove any doubts about being worthy to be saved. Salvation is not something we deserve, nor is it something we can earn. It is a gift that was purchased and paid for by the blood of Jesus. Through the cross, God laid the punishment for our sin on Jesus so that we might have right-standing with God through faith in Him (2 Corinthians 5:21).

Jesus was our substitute. He took the pain, penalty and punishment for our sin so that God could freely offer us salvation from our sin (Isaiah 53:3-5). “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life” (John 3:16). 

9 that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved (Romans 10:9)

God does not hold the wrong things you’ve done against you. You still need Jesus to be saved, Right now, you can make a decision to receive Jesus into your life by following these steps:

1. Believe that Jesus is the Son of God and that He was raised from the dead.

2. Accept Jesus as your Savior and proclaim Him Lord of your life.

If you desire to do this right now, pray the following prayer out loud and mean it with all of your heart:

“Heavenly Father, I come to You in the Name of Jesus. Your Word says, 'Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved' (Acts 2:21). I am calling on You.

“I pray and ask Jesus to come into my heart and be Lord over my life according to Romans 10:9-10: ‘If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is by believing in your heart that you are made right with God, and it is by confessing with your mouth that you are saved.' 'I do that now. I confess that Jesus is Lord, and I believe in my heart that God raised Him from the dead.

Take more of me Lord, Give me more of you, I give you full control of my life, YOUR will be done in my life, thank you for saving me. I receive the Holy Spirit, Come live in me, Seal me, in the name of Jesus! 

“I am now reborn!  I am a Christian—a child of Almighty God! Jesus is the Lord and savior of my life, I am saved, AMEN!”

Comment 🙏💓 if you chose life and got saved!! On behalf of us the Church to all newly/recently saved Welcome home family! Don't forget to be baptized, repent(turn away, to go in the opposite direction back to Jesus! DO NOT BE LUKEWARM), and continue your race with God! 🤗😊♥️ </COMMENT 8>

<COMMENT 4> Lần trước, tàu Liêu Ninh và 5 tàu hộ tống hôm 12.4 đã đi ngang eo biển Miyako ở phía nam Nhật Bản và phía đông Đài Loan, trước khi hướng về Biển Đông để tổ chức cuộc tập trận mà theo giới quan sát là nhằm gửi thông điệp cho Mỹ.
Trong buổi họp báo tại Bộ Ngoại giao Mỹ ngày 22.4, Ngoại trưởng Mike Pompeo tiếp tục cáo buộc Trung Quốc đang lợi dụng lúc thế giới tập trung ứng phó đại dịch Covid-19 để thực hiện "hành vi khiêu khích" nhằm gây áp lực đối với Hồng Kông, Đài Loan và bắt nạt các nước láng giềng ở Biển Đông, theo Reuters </COMMENT 4>

<COMMENT 9> 1 Phút sẽ cứu được ai đó hết nợ nần

Đôi lời chia sẻ tới mọi người mình là một người chơi lô đề và khi mình chơi thua lỗ bể nợ lên tới hơn 150 triệu , cuộc sống lúc đó đúng là đến tệ tới mức người gia đình còn xa lánh , mất hết niềm tin của anh em bạn bè. Cuộc sống thật dự bế tắc
Trước mình cũng mua số rất nhiều nơi phí trước.phí sau .miễn phí có cả .nhưng tiền mất tật mang mà chính như thế mình mới mang nợ nhiều. Hoang mang
, may sao lướt facebook  có quen đươc1 bạn và giới thiệu qua Bên Zalo Anh Nhật ____ 0854081234
 Hôm đầu tiên theo mình cũng sợ nên mình chỉ dám lấy lô mình ăn được 3 hôm lô liên tiếp thì mình có vốn và đủ sự tin tưởng thì mình lấy Đề ai ngờ trúng  cả   Đề .thì thực sự mình biết đây chính là ân nhân của mình rồi￼, qua đây anh chị em ai lâm vào hoàn cảnh như mình thì liên hệ với bác ấy xem mà cố gắng. Mình nói bằng chính facebook thật của mình hơn 2.000 bàn bè và tâm sự bằng chính những gì mình trải qua. Mong cho những ai nợ nần thì sớm hết nợ￼.hiểu rõ hơn ai hết￼ cảnh mang nợ
Chúc cho cả nhà một ngày mới tốt lành </COMMENT 9>
